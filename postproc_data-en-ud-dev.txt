in O
my O
university N

bit N
spare O
time N
in O
the O
office N
. O

can O
not O
it O
be O
done O
earlier O
than O

? O

And O
so O
on O
. O

And O
this O
Japanese O
businessman H
was O
one O
of O
the O
person H
who O
was O
standing N
in O
front N
of O
the O
lines N
. O

And O
people N
are O
very O
kind N
to O

, O
so O
I O
have O
a O
very O
good O
experience O
. O

Thank O

very O
much O
. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
. O

We O
were O
very O
fortunate O
escape O
the O
night O
from O
storm O
. O

Gifu O
stands N
for O
Kyoto O
. O

What O
do O
he O
do O
? O

I O
think O
it O
's O
a O
math N
class N
. O

And O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
but O
they O
are O
really O
cute O
, O
I O
think O
. O

So O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
find O
one O
shouchu O
for O
my O
father H
. O

I O
think O
she O
loves N
her O
computer N
. O

And O
there O
, O
I O
copy N
. O

that O
's O
a O
point N
, O
but O
you O
know O
, O
actually O
our O
favorites N
is O
almost O
same O

reading N
books N
, O
sing O
, O
and O
part N
- O
time N
job N
. O

whatever O
happens O
to O
he O
or O
she O
, O
who O
are O
from O
Japan O
, O
just O
smile N
, O
do O
not O
complain O
, O
do O
not O
protest N
, O
just O
smile N
and O
say O
, O
" O
It O
's O
OK O
, O
OK O
. O
" O
. O

And O
unfortunately O
, O
the O
motorcyclist H
dropped O
the O
cell A
phone N
. O

there O
are O
lot N
of O
old O
people N
. O

up O
of O
this O
floor N
, O
perhaps O
there O
are O
my O
two O
friend H

do O
you O
have O
another O
way N
to O
get O
to O
New O
York O
? O

how O
about O
your O
schedule N
? O

I O
live O
in O
Okinawa O
. O

Thank O
you O
. O

To O
help O
some O
disabled O
people N
? O

and O
I O
'm O
not O
really O
familiar O
with O
them O
. O

And O
I O
ran O
here O
. O

I O
forget O
they O
age N
. O

And O
on O
the O
way N
back O
home N
in O
the O
department N
store N
, O
I O
found O
a O
final O
sale N
of O
shoes N
. O

On O
the O
Internet N
, O
it O
was O
very O
convenient O
, O
but O
we O
could O
n't O
speak O
to O
anyone O
. O

my O
name N
is O
Charlie H
. O

I O
like O
playing O
tennis N
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
say O
. O

because O
nowadays O
, O
like O
, O
antique O
is O
only O
one O
in O
the O
world N
, O
most O
of O
them O
. O

After O
this O
test O
, O
I O
get O
home N
. O

But O
I O
could O
n't O
stop N
working O
. O

And O
unfortunately O
his O
tail N
lamp N
was O
broken O
from O
the O
accident N
. O

I O
'm O
interested O
in O
a O
testing O
. O

In O
morning N
? O

thank O
you O
. O

Nice O
rings N
. O

I O
tried O
snowboarding N
but O
I O
did O
n't O
do O
. O

just O
it O
takes O
fifteen O
minutes N
from O
my O
school N
, O
yeah O
. O

but O
they O
have O
much O
experiences N
. O

in O
terms N
of O
this O
my O
say O
, O
working O
room N

Next O
time N
, O
I O
really O
want O
to O
join O
your O
party N
. O

And O
the O
bike N
guy H
was O
left O
alone O
. O

After O
interview N
? O

So O
I O
was O
doing O
that O
. O

So O
she O
choose O
a O
good O
neck N
tie O

But O
I O
'm O
get O
used O
to O
it O
already O

" O
, O
stuff N
like O
that O
. O

It O
's O
very O
exciting O
. O

no O
, O
I O
take O
subway N
to O
Ueno O
and O
then O
I O
take O
J O
R O
to O
the O
closest O
station N
. O

I O
like O
red O
one O
, O
please O
. O

So O
we O
decided O
to O
stay O
at O
the O
hotel N
. O

I O
have O
a O
sore O
throat N

my O
days N
? O

The O
monkey A
eat O
banana A
. O

I O
've O
never O
tried O
skiing N
. O

so O
please O
sell O
me O
your O
ticket N
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
do O
. O

Do O
you O
know O
some O
action N
movie N
? O

Because O
I O
'm O
not O
rich O
. O

but O
I O
thought O
I O
could O
ask O
my O
sisters H
they O
help O
me O
take O
care O
of O
the O
cat A
. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
. O

And O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

So O
I O
just O
thought O
I O
try O
Osaka O
. O

So O
I O
did O
n't O
really O
think O
of O
" O
OK O
, O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
study N
, O
" O
but O
I O
wanted O
to O
see O
the O
different O
culture N
. O

So O
I O
first O
watch O
the O
movie N
is O
... O

Shinjuku O
is O
movie N
theater N
in O
— O

But O
they O
moved O
to O
Okinawa O
. O

Yes O
, O
sometimes O
. O

how O
about O
you O
? O

Brazil O
and O
Guatemala O
. O

no O
, O
no O
, O
no O
. O

fishes A
, O
meats N
, O
vegetables N
, O
and O
something O
like O
that O
. O

maybe O
I O
will O
go O
to O
United O
States N
by O
job N
. O

So O
maybe O
it O
will O
be O
crowded O
, O
I O
guess O
. O

And O
it O
blew O
away O
almost O
everything O
of O
our O
camping O
equipment N
. O

My O
mom H
fell O
off O
with O
the O
sickness N
. O

So O
I O
'm O
really O
nervous O
right O
now O
. O

So O
could O
you O
please O
exchange N
the O
ticket N
or O
could O
you O
give O
back O
the O
money N
for O
me O
? O

And O
when O
I O
go O
to O
my O
grandmother H
house N
, O
she O
feel O
very O
happy O
, O
so O
she O
give O
me O
many O
money N
. O

I O
can O
not O
tell O
you O
about O
what O
you O
can O
do O
after O
that O
. O

It O
's O
very O
far O
from O
here O
. O

that O
was O
last O
, O
maybe O
. O

It O
's O
OK O
. O

we O
were O
too O
sleepy O
. O

Because O
actually O
, O
the O
place N
I O
was O
living O
was O
Indianapolis O
. O

now O
, O
I O
'm O
learning N
English O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
special O
plans N
. O

They O
live O
slowly O
and O
gently O
in O
there O
. O

but O
if O
there O
's O
another O
chance N
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
that O
you O
could O
invite O
me O
again O
. O

And O
before O
the O
war N
, O
teachers H
are O
very O
prestigious O
job N
. O

And O
it O
's O
very O
peaceful O
and O
quiet O
place N
. O

I O
really O
appreciate O
what O
you O
doed O
for O
me O
, O
but O
, O
frankly O
speaking O
, O
I O
can O
not O
make O
it O
today N
. O

And O
from O
the O
right O
, O
there O
came O
a O
motor N
cycle O
. O

number N
three O
, O
we O
looked O
menu N
, O
and O
told O
waitress H
to O
my O
favorite O
hamburg O
. O

So O
I O
think O
I O
can O
find O
out O
now O
. O

And O
she O
always O
ask O
me O
to O
join O
them O
. O

How O
often O
watch O
the O
movie N
? O

But O
I O
wanted O
to O
buy O
just O
tie O

I O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
injure O
. O

That O
was O
great O
. O

Local O
train N
. O

the O
girl H
using O
her O
cell A
phone N
. O

But O
an O
hour N
later O
, O
it O
got O
worse O
and O
everything O
started O
to O
blow N
and O
we O
could O
n't O
stay O
here O
any O
more O
. O

And O
mister N
policeman H
came O
to O
— O
, O
and O
they O
were O
explaining O
what O
happened O
there O
. O

Then O
I O
decide O
the O
flight N
. O

And O
she O
was O
eating O
and O
seeing O
a O
monkey A
. O

One O
day N
last O
week N
, O
that O
day N
was O
raining O
. O

In O
comparison N
with O
the O
transportation N
in O
Tokyo O
, O
for O
example N
, O
the O
time N
schedule N
of O
bus N
is O
not O
correct O
. O

I O
went O
back O
to O
my O
home N
town N
with O
my O
wife H
. O

But O
recently O
, O
we O
do O
n't O
do O
much O
. O

I O
was O
very O
hungry O
, O
so O
I O
immediately O
ran O
to O
the O
supermarket N
to O
buy O
some O
foods N
. O

Because O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
wake O
up O
very O
early O
in O
the O
morning N
. O

But O
the O
waitresses H
are O
older O
lady H
. O

when O
wondering O
a O
shop N
, O
they O
may N
assume O
that O
this O
item N
is O
what O
they O
think O
they O
are O
, O
but O
when O
they O
bring O
it O
home N
and O
look O
through O
it O
, O
sometimes O
people N
find O
out O
that O
the O
quality N
of O
that O
item N
is O
not O
what O
they O
had O
in O
mind N
. O

I O
really O
like O
it O
. O

And O
it O
is O
fifty O
percent N
. O

I O
think O
so O
. O

Year N
, O
I O
guess O
so O
. O

And O
the O
wind N
got O
so O
strong O
that O
our O
tent N
was O
blown O
off O
. O

And O
looking O
at O
the O
bright O
side N
of O
it O
, O
the O
whole O
story N
, O
we O
ended O
up O
in O
a O
nice O
hotel N
room N
, O
bright O
sunshine N
the O
next O
morning N
with O
comfortable O
environment N
, O
enjoying O
tea N
. O

if O
my O
sister H
is O
fine O
because O
I O
have O
no O
idea N
in O
what O
kind N
of O
state N
she O
is O
in O
right O
now O
. O

The O
door N
is O
half O
open O
. O

The O
police N
man H
understood O
the O
situation N
. O

Because O
dog A
is O
more O
honestly O
than O
cat A
do O
. O

And O
repetition N
, O
you O
know O
. O

And O
, O
do O
you O
know O
Yurakucho O
Marion H
? O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
. O

So O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
like O
buy O
stuff N
like O
I O
— O
something O
— O

or O
no O
. O

I O
like O
suits N
. O

And O
I O
was O
told O
not O
to O
have O
driver H
's O
license N
. O

This O
is O
the O
famous O
Italian O
restaurant N
. O

But O
it O
was O
very O
good O
. O

Then O
of O
course O
the O
other O
person H
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
around O
my O
car N
. O

I O
'm O
living O
there O
with O
my O
wife H
and O
my O
one O
son H
. O

So O
, O
and O
I O
also O
had O
to O
prepare O
for O
this O
test O
. O

so O
I O
can O
stand O
there O
. O

You O
Charlie H
? O

Yeah O
, O
it O
's O
very O
hard O
to O
walk O
around O
at O
the O
zoo N
, O
I O
think O
. O

And O
they O
're O
very O
quick O
. O

And O
my O
daughter H
. O

because O
not O
so O
cold O
, O
not O
so O
hot O
. O

and O
they O
said O
yes O
, O

and O
her O
persistence N
has O
paid O
off O
. O

There O
are O
students H
who O
do O
n't O
really O
pay O
attention N
because O
they O
do O
n't O
really O
care O
. O

It O
's O
hard O
negotiation N
. O

And O
smoking N
. O

and O
ethnically O
also O
it O
's O
really O
interesting O
place N
. O

They O
just O
read O
the O
textbook N
and O
follow O
the O
textbook N
. O

But O
, O
when O
I O
need O
time N
, O
always O
holidays N
come O
. O

And O
when O
they O
got O
there O
, O
they O
built O
a O
tent N
and O
built O
a O
fire N
and O
started O
to O
cook H
. O

And O
it O
was O
.... O

I O
will O
go O
to O
the O
supermarket N
. O

And O
my O
dog A
. O

I O
'd O
like O
to O
take O
interesting O
book O
. O

this O
is O
high O
school N
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
many O
high O
school N
students H
enjoy O
math N
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I O
have O
a O
class N
right O
now O

Economy N
class N
, O
OK O
. O

I O
have O
only O
a O
ten O
dollars N
. O

He O
was O
enjoying O
his O
drive N
. O

he O
is O
sitting O
and O
he O
is O
working O
on O
a O
personal O
computer N
. O

So O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
me O
to O
communicate O
with O
native O
people N
. O

just O
to O
the O
accident N
so O
it O
can O
not O
be O
helped O
. O

Australia O
and O
Beijing O
and O
Korea O
and O
Moscow O
and O
Belgium O
. O

One O
day N
last O
week N
, O
woman H
in O
her O
kitchen N
looked O
at O
her O
refrigerator N
to O
see O
it O
was O
empty O
. O

And O
, O
yes O
, O
I O
think O
you O
have O
scale N
about O
for O
eighty O
percent N
to O
go O
pass O
through O
it O
. O

So O
on O
fine O
days N
like O
this O
? O

I O
just O
got O
out O
of O
a O
class N
in O
Arabic O
, O
and O
it O
was O
kind N
of O
difficult O

it O
depends O
. O

So O
might O
be O
a O
good O
day N
to O
go O
shopping N
, O
maybe O
. O

But O
expensive O
... O
, O

not O
at O
all O
. O

you O
can O
keep O
the O
cat A
. O
" O
. O

what O
's O
the O
point N
? O

And O
I O
stopped O
the O
car N
. O

But O
they O
did O
n't O
. O

one O
, O
I O
think O
because O
students H
are O
n't O
interested O
in O
mathematics N
. O

And O
it O
was O
like O
the O
ticket N
I O
bought O
was O
five O
hundred O
eighty O
yen N
. O

Nice O
meet O
you O
. O

Like O
it O
's O
like O
a O
drugstore N
in O
Osaka O

From O

this O
story N

President H

two O
individuals H
to O

Bush H

The O

been O
attacked O
with O

He O
could O
be O
killed O
years N

and O
the O
israelians O
have O
all O
the O
reasons N
, O
since O
he O
founded O
and O
he O
is O
the O
spiritual O
leader H
of O
Hamas O
, O
but O
they O
didn't O
did O
n't O
. O

Today's O
Today N
's O
incident N
proves O
that O
Sharon H
has O
lost O
his O
patience N
and O
his O
hope O
in O
peace N
. O

Nervous O
people N
make O
mistakes N
, O
so O
I H
suppose O
there O
will O
be O
a O
wave N
of O
succesfull O
arab O
attacks N
. O

A O
la O
guerre O
c'est O
comme O
a O
la O
guerre O
! O

In O
the O
eastern O
city O
of O
Baqubah O
, O
guerrillas H
detonated O
a O
car N
bomb N
outside O
a O
police N
station N
, O
killing O
several O
people N
. O

The O
US O
lost O
yet O
another O
helicopter N
to O
hostile O
fire N
near O
Habbaniyah O
in O
the O
Sunni O
heartland N
, O
but O
this O
time N
the O
crew N
was O
safe O
. O

In O
Fallujah O
, O
hundreds N
of O
demonstrators H
came O
out O
against O
US O
troops N
when O
they O
briefly O
arrested O
a O
yound O
newlywed O
bride H
. O

( O
I H
hope O
that O
the O
US O
army N
got O
an O
enormous O
amount N
of O
information N
from O
her O
relatives H
, O
because O
otherwise O
this O
move O
was O
a O
bad O
, O
bad O
tradeoff N
) O
. O

The O
US O
troops N
fired O
into O
the O
hostile O
crowd N
, O
killing O
4 O
. O

It O
seems O
clear O
to O
me H
that O
the O
manhunt N
for O
high O
Baath O
officials H
in O
the O
Sunni O
heartland N
is O
being O
done O
wrong O
, O
or O
at O
least O
in O
ways N
that O
are O
bad O
for O
US O
standing N
with O
local O
Iraqis O
. O

Google O
has O
finally O

these O

just O
a O
chance N

this O

They O
work N

not O

you'd O

My H
opinion N

on O
the O
implications N
of O
Arafat's O
Arafat O
's O
passing O
for O
al O
- O

has O
appeared O
at O
Newsday O
. O

Excerpt N
: O

" O
Arafat's O
Arafat O
's O
secular O
nationalism N
was O
supple O
enough O
to O
compromise O
with O
Israel O
and O
to O
imagine O
a O
two O
- O
state N
solution N
, O
even O
if O
the O
road N
of O
negotiations N
remained O
rocky O
. O

The O
continued O
Israeli O
colonization N
of O
the O
occupied O
Palestinian O
territories O
during O
the O
1990s N
helped O
, O
along O
with O
terrorist H
attacks N
by O
radical O
groups N
such O
as O
Hamas O
, O
to O
derail O
the O
peace N
process N
, O
which O
Sharon H
had O
always O
opposed O
. O

Arafat's O
Arafat O
's O
death N
creates O
a O
vacuum N
in O
Palestinian O
leadership N
that O
will O
not O
soon O
be O
filled O
. O

Sharon's O
Sharon H
's O
assassination N
of O
major O
Hamas O
leaders H
has O
also O
weakened O
authority N
structures N
in O
that O
party N
. O

If O
the O
Israelis H
and O
the O
Palestinian O
leadership N
cannot O
can O
not O
find O
a O
way N
to O
reinvigorate O
the O
peace N
process N
, O
cells N
of O
radical O
young O
Palestinians O
may N
grow O
up O
that O
look O
to O
bin O
Laden O
for O
their O
cues N
. O

Even O
if O
local O
Palestinian O
leaders H
remain O
strong O
enough O
to O
keep O
al O
- O
Qaida O
out O
, O
the O
festering O
Israeli O
- O
Palestinian O
struggle N
remains O
among O
the O
best O
recruiting O
posters N
for O
al O
- O
Qaida O
with O
young O
Muslim O
men H
. O

Resolving O
this O
conflict N
would O
be O
the O
most O
effective O
weapon N
the O
United O
States N
could O
deploy O
in O
its O
war N

terror H

Ever O
since O
the O

about O

most O
investors H
have O
feared O
that O

even O

spectacularly O
profitable O
business N
model N

some O
nearly O
flawless O
execution N

the O
price N

be O
too O
high O
for O
investors H

make O
a O
real O
profit N

Now O

people N

if O

even O

That's O
That O
's O
overstating O
it O
, O
I H
know O
. O

What O
they O
wonder O
is O
whether O
Google O
can O
be O
anything O
more O
than O
what O
it's O
it O
's O
always O
been O
-- O
a O

Simplicity N
gave O
it O
that O
blessed O

laudatory O
lack N
of O

, O
the O
efficient O

effective O

, O
and O
the O

The O
problem N
is O
that O
customers H
attracted O
by O
a O
simple O
interface N
are O
among O
the O
least O
loyal O
you H
can O
find O

the O
fight N

for O

fewest O
- O

The O
other O
problem N
? O

It's O
It O
's O
tough O
to O
make O
money N
branching O
out O
when O
your H
appeal N

As O
the O
survey N

, O
most O
Google O

don't O

If O
they O
continue O

they O
can O
justify O
their O

high O

, O
Google O

Remember O
when O
a O
whole O
lot N

people N
had O
to O
die O
because O
a O
Swedish O
newspaper N
printed O
those O
cartoons N

Now O

turn O
the O
tables N

is O
inviting O

to O
do O
their O
best O
by O
depicting O

Amazingly O
, O
these O
idiots H
think O
a O

the O

Islamic O
Party N

had O
earlier O

absolutely O
committed O

out O

The O

The O
hottest O
item N
on O
Christmas N
wish O
lists N
this O
year N
is O
nuclear O
weapons N
. O

Al O
- O
Qaeda O
wants O
them O
, O
Iran O
wants O
them O
, O
Russia O
wants O
the O
better O
ones O
, O
and O
all O
the O
US O
wants O
is O
to O
give O
them O
all O
a O
piece N
of O
coal N
. O

For O
the O
last O
few O
years N
there O
have O
been O
tensions N
with O
Iran’s O
Iran O
’s O
nuclear O
program N
with O
word N
coming O
this O
week N
that O
a O
deal N
was O
reached O
through O
the O
European O
Union O
that O
meets O
with O
the O
approval N
of O
the O
International O
Atomic O
Energy O
Agency O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time N
, O
an O
Iranian O
Opposition N
Group N
released O
what O
they O
call O
proof N
of O
a O
covert O
nuclear O
weapons N
program N
. O

Arial O
photos N
, O
loose O
connections N
to O
AQ O
Kahn H
and O
Libya O
make O
up O
the O
evidence N
that O
the O
group N
presented O
. O

Russia O
also O
announced O
that O
it O
was O
seeking O
and O
building O
the O
best O
nukes N
the O
world’s O
world N
’s O
ever O
seen O
. O

President H
Vladimir H
Putin H
said O
Russia O
is O
will O
have O
new O
nuclear O
weapons N
that O
other O
countries N
do O
not O
and O
will O
not O
have O
. O

With O
the O
demand N
so O
high O
, O
the O
question N
arises O
on O
to O
who O
should O
be O
or O
has O
the O
right O
to O
be O
the O
Santa O
of O
nuclear O
weapons N
. O

Right O
now O
that O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
US O
, O
EU O
, O
and O
IAEA O
. O

But O
not O
always O
do O
those O
three O
agree O
, O
and O
not O
always O
are O
their O
decisions N
equal O
. O

The O
US O
has O
strongly O
opposed O
a O
nuclear O
weapons N
program N
of O
Iran O
, O
yet O
Israel O
, O
which O
to O
this O
day N
has O
never O
officially O
said O
that O
they O
posses O
nuclear O
weapons N
, O
ranks N
around O
fifth O
in O
nuclear O
strength N
. O

It O
is O
estimated O
that O
Israel O
has O
over O
200 O
nuclear O
weapons N
yet O
neither O
the O
US O
nor O
any O
of O
her O
allies N
expresses O
the O
slightest O
concern N
. O

North O
Korea’s O
Korea O
’s O
Kim H
Jong H
Ill O
also O
has O
the O
bomb N
at O
the O
top O
of O
his O
list O
and O
Santa H
seems O
to O
have O
already O
come O
a O
few O
years N
ago O
. O

It O
is O
rumored O
that O
North O
Korea O
has O
at O
least O
a O
couple N
nuclear O
weapons N
. O

But O
getting O
past O
who O
should O
get O
them O
, O
is O
who O
has O
them O
, O
and O
who O
is O
really O
close O
. O

The O
case N
against O
Iran O
has O
a O
feeling N
of O
Déjà O
vu O
. O

Arial O
photos N
of O
the O
lab N
were O
uranium N
is O
being O
enriched O
, O
somewhat O
like O
those O
of O
chemical O
weapons N
stockpiles N
in O
Iraq O
. O

America O
cried O
wolf A
in O
Iraq O
, O
and O
what’s O
what O
’s O
scary O
is O
that O
sooner O
or O
later O
, O
that O
wolf A
will O
probably O
get O
us H
. O

I H
ran O
across O
this O
item N
on O
the O
Internet N
. O

Sooooo O
. O

The O
United O
States N
goes O
into O
a O
war N
zone N
and O
evacuates O
a O
bunch N
of O
U.S. O
citizens H
( O
most O
of O
whom O
were O
" O
dual O
- O
citizens H
" O
) O
. O

Then O
, O
eschewing O
normal O
procedure N
, O
the O
Department O
of O
State N
waived O
the O
fees N
that O
they O
charge N
for O
evacuating O
U.S. O
citizen H
. O

Why O
? O

To O
pander O
to O
the O
mythical O
" O
Arab H
street N
" O
, O
of O
course O
. O

Now O
, O
I H
would O
argue O
that O
one O
could O
have O
reasonably O
predicted O
that O
some O
form N
of O
military O
violence N
was O
likely O
to O
occur O
in O
Lebanon O
( O
considering O
that O
the O
country N
has O
been O
experiencing O
some O
form N
of O
conflict N
for O
approximately O
the O
last O
32 O
years N
) O
. O

In O
other O
words N
, O
those O
Americans H
were O
there O
by O
their O
own O
choice N
, O
mired O
in O
a O
situation N
that O
was O
totally O
predictable O
. O

Yet O
we H
didn't O
did O
n't O
charge N
them O
for O
the O
evacuation N
. O

This O
is O
unlike O
the O
situation N
last O
year N
in O
Asia O
when O
we H
evacuated O
U.S. O
citizens H
from O
areas N
that O
were O
hit O
by O
the O
tsunami N
- O
a O
phenomenon N
that O
is O
much O
less O
predictable O
than O
the O
Hezbollah O
- O
provoked O
destruction N
that O
rained O
down O
on O
Lebanon O
. O

And O
what O
do O
we H
get O
for O
this O
effort N
? O

A O
lawsuit N
. O

That's O
That O
's O
right O
, O
folks N
. O

The O
American O
- O
Arab H
Discrimination O
Committee N
is O
suing O
Condoleeza O
Rice H
and O
Donald H
Rumsfeld O
, O
charging O
that O
they O
mismanaged O
the O
evacuation N
efforts N
. O

Here's O
Here O
's O
an O
excerpt N
from O
the O
article N
: O

Nina H
Chahine O
, O
19 O
, O
who O
with O
her O
family N
was O
among O
the O
named O
plaintiffs H
in O
the O
lawsuit N
, O
said O
her O
wedding N
in O
the O
southern O
city O
of O
Tyre O
was O
set O
for O
July O
13 O
. O

The O
wedding N
had O
to O
be O
postponed O
as O
family N
members H
fled O
the O
outbreak N
of O
the O
war N
, O
she O
said O
. O

" O
We H
were O
on O
the O
road N
and O
the O
first O
bridge N
was O
bombed O
and O
we H
drove O
home N
and O
all O
the O
other O
bridges N
were O
bombed O
and O
there O
was O
absolutely O
no O
way N
for O
us H
to O
get O
home N
, O
" O
Chahine O
told O
reporters H
outside O
federal O
court N
in O
Detroit O
. O

" O
We H
were O
all O
American O
citizens H
and O
there O
was O
no O
way N
that O
anybody O
helped O
us H
. O

No O
communications N
nothing O
. O

I H
was O
on O
my H
way N
to O
my H
wedding N
fearing O
death N
, O
basically O
. O
" O

Chahine O
said O
her O
immediate O
family N
spent O
about O
$ O
20,000 O
to O
return N
to O
Detroit O
via O
Syria O
and O
Jordan O
. O

Dear O
Nina H
, O

Here's O
Here O
's O
a O
tip N
: O
Don't O
Do O
n't O
get O
married O
in O
countries N
that O
house N
illegal O
militias N
that O
attack O
other O
countries N
and O
hence O
are O
likely O
to O
come O
under O
counter-attack O
! O

Crap N
like O
this O
sure O
makes O
me H
want O
to O
rush N
right O
out O
and O
rescue O
people N
from O
dilemmas N
of O
their O
own O
making O
. O

Though O
I H
am O
loathe O
to O
quote O
other O
writers H
at O
legnth O
in O
this O
space N
, O
this O
little O
bit N
from O
Dan H
Froomkin's O
Froomkin O
's O
" O
White O
House N
Briefing O

column N
in O
the O
WashPost O
today N
is O
just O
too O
good O
to O
pass O
up O
( O
read O
the O
whole O
column N
here O
) O
: O

At O
the O
Ask O
the O
President H
event N
on O
Friday N
, O
one O
of O
the O
questions N
was O
about O
whether O
Bush H
has O
any O
thoughts N
about O
his O
memoirs N
. O

This O
is O
one O
example N
of O
what O
happens O
when O
Bush H
gets O
a O
question N
that O
he O
hasn't O
has O
n't O
anticipated O
. O

" O
Q N
Thank O
you H
-- O
I H
was O
wondering O
, O
there's O
there O
's O
a O
lot N
of O
talk O
right O
now O
about O
memoirs N
being O
written O
with O
the O
former O
President H
. O

After O
you H
are O
elected O
in O
2004 O
, O
what O
will O
your H
memoirs N
say O
about O
you H
, O
what O
will O
the O
title N
be O
, O
and O
what O
will O
the O
main O
theme N
say O
? O

THE O
PRESIDENT O

I H
appreciate O
that O

There O
is O

first O
of O
all O
, O
I H
don't O
do O

I'm O
I H

just O
speculating O
now O

I H
really O
haven't O
have O
n't O
thought O
about O
writing N
a O
book O

My H
life N
is O
too O
complicated O
right O
now O
trying O
to O
do O
my H
job N

But O
if O
-- O
there's O
there O
's O
a O
painting N
on O
the O
wall N
in O
the O
Oval O
Office O
that O
shows O
a O
horseman H
charging O
up O
a O
steep O
cliff N
, O
and O
there O
are O
at O
least O
two O
other O
horsemen H
following O
. O

It's O
It O
's O
a O
Western O
scene N
by O
a O
guy H
named O
W.H.S. O
Koerner O
called O
' O
A O
Charge O
to O
Keep O

It's O
It O
's O
on O
loan N
, O
by O
the O
way N
, O
from O
a O
guy H
named O
Joe H
O'Neill O
in O
Midland O

Texas O
. O

He O
was O
the O
person H
, O
he O
and O
his O
wife H
Jan H

introduced O
-- O
reintroduced O
me H
and O
Laura H
in O
his O
backyard N
in O
July O
of O
1977 O
. O

Four O
months N
later O
, O
we H
were O
married O
. O

So O
he's O
he O
's O
got O
a O
-- O
I'm O
I H
'm O
a O
decision N

maker H
and O
I H
can O
make O
good O
decisions N

( O
Applause N

) O

" O
And O
so O
we H
sang O
this O
hymn N

this O
is O
a O
long O
story N
trying O
to O
get O
to O
your H
answer O

This O

a O
Senate O

particularly O
on O
good O

Applause N

The O
hymn N
was O
sung O
at O
my H
first O
inaugural O
church N
service N
as O
governor H
. O

Laura H
and O
I H
are O
Methodists O

One O
of O
the O
Wesley H
boys H
wrote O
the O
hymn N

The O
painting N
is O
based O
upon O
the O
hymn N
called O
, O
' O
A O
Charge O
to O
Keep O

' O

I H
have O
. O

The O
hymn N
talks N
about O
serving O
something O
greater O
than O
yourself H
in O
life N

I H
-- O
which O
I H
try O
to O
do O

as O
best O
as O
I H
possibly O
can O

" O
The O
book O

I H
guess O
one O
way N

one O
thing N
to O
think O
about O
it O

one O
of O
the O
themes N
would O
be O
, O
I H
was O
given O
a O

And O
I H
gave O
it O
all O
my H

all O
my H
energy N

based O
upon O
principles N

did O
not O
change N

" O

Now O
that's O
that O
's O
a O
rambling O
response N

And O
I H
have O
to O
wonder O
: O
Did O
he O
forget O
that O
he O
already O
has O
a O
memoir N
called O
" O
A O
Charge O
to O
Keep O

? O

That O
was O
the O
name N

Amazon O
( O

create O
a O
brave O
new O
world N
of O
media N
in O
2008 O
. O

This O
is O
one O
thought O
- O
provoking O
film O
. O

Every O
move O
Google O
makes O
brings O
this O
particular O
future N
closer O
. O

Just O
one O
small O
commment N
- O
it's O
it O
's O
not O
possible O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I H
know O
, O
for O
Google O
to O
" O
Aquire O
" O
Firefox O
. O

They O
already O
have O
rights N
to O
take O
it O
, O
alter O
it O
, O
and O
release N
those O
changes O
to O
the O
world N
- O
this O
is O
what O
the O
whole O
open O
source N
thing N
is O
about O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
inclined O
to O
say O
that O
google O
is O
doing O
what O
they O
can O
to O
both O
shape O
and O
support N
the O
growth N
of O
the O
most O
popular O
non-Microsoft O
browser N
out O
there O
- O
by O
taking O
on O
the O
leading O
lights O
in O
Firefox O
development N
, O
they're O
they O
're O
ensuring O
the O
continued O
life N
of O
the O
project N
, O
and O
ensuring O
( O
not O
that O
I H
think O
they O
need O
to O
) O
that O
their O
voice N
will O
be O
heard O
admidst O
the O
higher O
echelons N
of O
the O
firefox O
development N
team A
. O

It's O
It O
's O
this O
sort N
of O
enlightened O
self N
interest N
that O
keeps O
large O
open O
source N
projects N
alive O
. O

Fascinating O
viewpoint N
of O
the O
future N
in O
Epic O
. O

Thanks N
for O
the O
link N
. O

Malach O
, O
What O
you H
say O
makes O
sense N
. O

Acquiring O
open O
source N
talent N
gives O
a O
company N
an O
inexpensive O
way N
of O
influencing O
and O
anticipating O
the O
direction N
an O
open O
source N
project N
will O
go O
. O

It O
probably O
gives O
more O
bang N
for O
the O
buck N
than O
acquiring O
a O
private O
company N
and O
having O
to O
handle O
the O
inevitable O
culture N
clashes N
and O
process N
mis-matches O
. O

The O
Coalition O
decision N
to O
provoke O
a O
fight N
with O
Muqtada O
al O
- O
Sadr's O
Sadr O
's O
movement N
only O
three O
months N
before O
the O
Coalition O
Provisional O
Authority O
goes O
out O
of O
business N
has O
to O
be O
seen O
as O
a O
form N
of O
gross O
incompetence N
in O
governance N
. O

How O
did O
the O
CPA H
get O
to O
the O
point N
where O
it O
has O
turned O
even O
Iraqi O
Shiites O
, O
who O
were O
initially O
grateful O
for O
the O
removal N
of O
Saddam H
Hussein H
, O
against O
the O
United O
States N
? O

Where O
it O
risks N
fighting O
dual O
Sunni O
Arab H
and O
Shiite O
insurgencies N
simultaneously O
, O
at O
a O
time N
when O
US O
troops N
are O
rotating O
on O
a O
massive O
scale N
and O
hoping O
to O
downsize O
their O
forces N
in O
country N
? O

At O
a O
time N
when O
the O
Spanish O
, O
Thai O
and O
other O
contingents N
are O
already O
committed O
to O
leaving O
, O
and O
the O
UN O
is O
reluctant O
to O
get O
involved O
? O

One O
answer O
is O
that O
the O
Pentagon O
prevented O
the O
State N
Department O
from O
running O
the O
CPA H
. O

State N
is O
the O
body N
with O
experience O
in O
international O
affairs N
and O
administration N
. O

The O
civilians H
in O
the O
Department O
of O
Defense O
only O
know O
how O
to O
blow N
things N
up O
. O

Rumsfeld O
, O
Wolfowitz O
and O
Feith O
staffed O
the O
CPA H
with O
Neoconservatives H
, O
most O
of O
whom O
had O
no O
administrative O
experience O
, O
no O
Arabic O
, O
and O
no O
respect N
for O
Muslim O
culture N
( O
or O
knowledge N
about O
it O
) O
. O

They O
actively O
excluded O
State N
Department O
Iraq O
hands N
like O
Tom H
Warrick O
. O

( O
Only O
recently O
have O
a O
few O
experienced O
State N
Department O
Arabists H
been O
allowed O
in O
to O
try O
to O
begin O
mopping O
up O
the O
mess N
. O
) O

The O
Neocons O
in O
the O
CPA H
have O
all O
sorts O
of O
ulterior O
motives N
and O
social O
experiments N
they O
want O
to O
impose O
on O
the O
Iraqi O
people N
, O
including O
Polish O
- O
style N
economic O
shock N
therapy N
, O
some O
sort N
of O
sweetheart H
deal N
for O
Israel O
, O
and O
maybe O
even O
breaking O
the O
country N
up O
into O
three O
parts N
. O

The O
Washington O
Monthly's O
Monthly O
's O
Who's O
Who O
's O
Who O
of O
Neocons O
in O
Iraq O
helps O
explain O
the O
extreme O
incompetence N
and O
possibly O
double O
- O
dealing O
of O
many O
in O
the O
CPA H
. O

Sept. O
11 O
Commission N
member H
Philip H
Zelikow O
, O
who O
is O
close O
to O
the O
Bush H
administration N
, O
admitted O
on O
Sept. O
10 O
, O
2002 O
, O
that O
the O
ulterior O
motive N
of O
the O
Bush H
administration N
for O
the O
Iraq O
War N
was O
to O
" O
protect O
Israel O
, O
" O
according O
to O
the O
Asian O
Times O
. O

I H
have O
long O
been O
a O
trenchant O
critic H
of O
the O
Sadrists O
. O

But O
they O
haven't O
have O
n't O
been O
up O
to O
anything O
extraordinary O
as O
far O
as O
I H
can O
see O
in O
recent O
weeks N
. O

Someone O
in O
the O
CPA H
sat O
down O
and O
thought O
up O
ways N
to O
stir O
them O
up O
by O
closing O
their O
newspaper N
and O
issuing O
28 O
arrest O
warrants N
and O
taking O
in O
people N
like O
Yaqubi O
. O

This O
is O
either O
gross O
incompetence N
or O
was O
done O
with O
dark O
ulterior O
motives N
that O
can O
scarcely O
be O
guessed O
at O
. O

There O
is O
a O
classical O
logical O
fallacy N
, O
post N
hoc O
ergo O
propter O
hoc O
( O
Z N
happens O
after O
X O
, O
therefore O
Z N
is O
caused O
by O
X O
) O
, O
and O
I H
keep O
revising O
this O
posting N
this O
evening N
because O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
fall O
into O
it O
. O

But O
sometimes O
, O
of O
course O
, O
when O
Z N
happens O
after O
X O
it O
is O
because O
of O
X O
. O

So O
I H
may N
as O
well O
just O
come O
out O
with O
it O
: O
It O
is O
pretty O
suspicious O
, O
given O
the O
Neocon H
predominance N
in O
the O
CPA H
and O
in O
the O
upper O
reaches N
of O
the O
Defense O
Department O
that O
on O
April O
2 O
AP O
reported O
of O
Muqtada O
: O

' O
A O
radical O
Shiite O
Muslim O
cleric H
has O
expressed O
solidarity N
with O
the O
militant O
Palestinian O
group N
Hamas O
and O
said O
that O
he O
should O
be O
considered O
the O
group's O
group N
's O
" O
striking N
arm N
" O
in O
Iraq O
. O

" O
I H
have O
said O
and O
I H
repeat N
my H
expression N
of O
solidarity N
which O
Hassan H
Nasrallah O
called O
for O
to O
stand O
with O
Hamas O
, O
" O
Shiite O
cleric H
Muqtada O
al O
- O
Sadr O
said O
Friday N
in O
a O
reference N
to O
Nasrallah O
, O
the O
leader H
of O
the O
militant O
Lebanese O
Shiite O
group N
Hezbollah O
. O

Last O
month N
, O
Nasrallah O
announced O
that O
his O
party N
would O
close O
ranks N
with O
Hamas O
. O

" O
Let O
( O
Hamas O
) O
consider O
me H
their O
striking N
arm N
in O
Iraq O
because O
the O
fate N
of O
Iraq O
and O
Palestine O
is O
the O
same O
, O
" O
al O
- O
Sadr O
said O
during O
a O
Friday N
prayer N
sermon N
in O
Kufa O
, O
his O
home N
base N
south O
of O
Baghdad O
. O

He O
did O
comment O
on O
what O
he O
meant O
by O
the O
phrase N
. O
' O

And O
on O
April O
3 O
his O
chief O
aide H
in O
Najaf O
was O
suddenly O
arrested O
along O
with O
13 O
other O
members H
of O
his O
organization N
, O
and O
the O
Coalition O
forces N
are O
put O
into O
violent O
conflict N
with O
his O
organization N
, O
which O
leaves O
7 O
US O
soldiers H
dead O
. O

The O
Army O
is O
unlikely O
to O
forgive O
or O
forget O
; O
but O
who O
provoked O
it O
and O
why O
? O

I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
even O
in O
Iraq O
and O
I H
could O
have O
predicted O
to O
you H
the O
consequences N
of O
doing O
what O
the O
CPA H
has O
been O
doing O
. O

Anthony H
Shadid O
of O
the O
Washington O
Post O
reveals O
that O
the O
warrants N
for O
the O
arrests N
had O
been O
issued O
months N
be O
for O
. O

Why O
were O
they O
suddenly O
acted O
on O
Saturday N
? O

All O
: O

It O
is O
my H
understanding N
, O
from O
good O
sources N
in O
the O
Govs O
Gov O
s O
office N
that O
the O
Gov O
will O
order N
Loretta O
Lynch H
to O
expeditiously O
implement O
the O
provision N
to O
suspend O
all O
parties N
auhtority N
to O
enter O
into O
direct O
access N
contracts N
. O

The O
premise N
with O
which O
the O
administartion N
is O
acting O
is O
that O
if O
they O
expeditiously O
suspend O
everyone's O
everyone O
's O
right O
to O
bilateral O
contracts N
quickly O
, O
it O
sets O
up O
a O
barrier N
which O
the O
direct O
access N
coalition N
must O
break O
through O
. O

In O
other O
words N
the O
table N
is O
set O
. O

Deal O
your H
meal N
from O
where O
the O
dishes N
are O
located O
. O

I.E. O
the O
Davis O
Administration N
wants O
to O
place N
all O
direct O
access N
advocates H
in O
the O
position N
of O
having O
to O
justify O
why O
each O
and O
every O
party N
should O
be O
the O
exception N
to O
the O
suspension N
rather O
than O
have O
a O
general O
rule N
concerning O
how O
direct O
access N
should O
work N
for O
all O
parties N
. O

It O
clearly O
gives O
the O
Admin O
a O
very O
strong O
upper O
hand N
to O
control N
who O
when O
and O
where O
direct O
access N
can O
occur O
without O
having O
to O
say O
that O
they O
oppose O
direct O
access N
. O

Power N

I H
spoke O
to O
Bruce H

at O
NiMo O

their O
RFP O

Bruce H
indicated O
NiMo O
short O
listed O
five O

who O
all O
bid N
higher O
than O
ENA O
. O

However O
, O
he O

mentioned O
we H
were O
a O

sixth O
, O
that O
is O
close O

the O
fifth O

bid N
. O

He O
gave O
no O
indication N
on O
the O
value N
of O
the O
highest O
bid N
. O

He O
also O
said O
that O
the O
other O
five O
companies N
making O
the O
short O
list O
all O
proposed O
alternative O
structures N
to O
the O
proposed O
NiMo O

released O
an O

I H
was O
thinking O
of O
converting O
it O
to O

I H
might O
just O
sell O
the O
car N
and O
get O
you H
to O
drive N
me H
around O

about O

You H
have O
always O
been O
on O
the O
move O
seeking O
affectionate O
, O
satisfying O
and O
harmonious O
relationships N
. O

Your H
ultimate O
goal N
has O
been O
the O
realisation N
of O
an O
intimate O
union N
in O
which O
there O
could O
be O
love O
, O
self N
- O
sacrifice N
and O
mutual O
trust O
. O

It O
has O
often O
been O
said O
that O
" O
True O
love O
is O
just O
around O
the O
corner N
" O
... O
and O
maybe O
... O
if O
you H
haven't O
have O
n't O
found O
it O
as O
yet O
- O
you H
possibly O
soon O
will O
. O

In O
the O
past O
there O
have O
been O
.. O
and O
maybe O
there O
still O
are O
many O
things N
that O
you H
have O
had O
to O
do O
without O
. O

You H
have O
now O
decided O
to O
set O
your H
sights N
on O
a O
position N
or O
situation N
that O
could O
give O
you H
greater O
prestige N
and O
which O
will O
afford O
you H
considerable O
self N
esteem N
. O

You H
wear O
your H
heart N
on O
your H
sleeve N
... O
and O
since O
you H
are O
an O
emotional O
person H
you H
are O
apt O
to O
give O
your H
all O
... O
heart N
and O
soul N
... O
to O
all O
those O
that O
show O
you H
a O
little O
affection N
... O
but O
take O
care O
... O
it O
would O
appear O
that O
you H
have O
been O
extremely O
hurt O
in O
the O
past O
... O
and O
you H
keep O
leaving O
yourself H
wide O
open O
for O
punishment N
.. O

Whatever O
you H
strive O
to O
do O
, O
something O
always O
seems O
to O
be O
holding O
you H
back O
. O

There O
is O
no O
subterfuge N
in O
you H
. O

You H
are O
a O
clear O
thinker H
and O
all O
you H
demand N
from O
life N
, O
in O
a O
relationship N
, O
is O
a O
partner H
whom O
you H
can O
trust O
and O
with O
whom O
you H
can O
, O
together O
, O
develop O
a O
foundation N
of O
trust O
based O
on O
understanding N
. O

You H
are O
your H
own O
person H
... O
and O
you H
demand N
freedom N
of O
thought O
... O
to O
follow O
your H
own O
convictions N
. O

You H
have O
no O
interest N
in O
" O
two O
- O
timing N
" O
and O
all O
you H
seek O
is O
sincerity N
and O
" O
straight O
- O
dealing O
" O
. O

You H
wish O
to O
be O
left O
in O
peace N
... O
no O
more O
conflict N
and O
no O
more O
differences N
of O
opinion N
... O

In O
fact N
you H
just O
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
any O
arguments N
of O
any O
shape O
or O
form N
... O

All O
you H
want O
is O
for O
" O
them O
" O
to O
get O
on O
with O
it O
- O
and O
to O
leave O
you H
alone O

Dear O
All O
, O

My H
mane N
is O
Visit O
Phunnarungsi O
. O

I H
used O
to O
e-mail N
Vince H
Kaminski O
about O
the O
advice N
on O
his O
article N
" O
The O
Challenge O
of O
Pricing O
and O
Risk O
Managing O
Electricity O
Derivatives O
" O
and O
he O
had O
mailed O
me H
the O
copy N
. O

I H
am O
now O
modelling O
the O
Queensland O
electricity N
spot N
price N
using O
Geometric O
Brownian O
Mean N
Reverting O
Jump N
Diffusion N
Model N
and O
have O
followed O
your H
paper N
" O
Making O
the O
most O
of O
mean O
reversion N
" O
to O
estimate O
the O
mean O
reversion N
speed N
. O

I H
use N
Queensland O
half O
- O
hourly O
price N
during O
13 O
December O
, O
1998 O
- O
30 O
June O
2001 O
giving O
about O
44,000 O
price N
observations N
. O

However O
, O
the O
result N
from O
Ordinary O
Least O
Squares N
was O
not O
as O
expected O
due O
to O
different O
sign O
for O
both O
slope N
& O
intercept N
. O

The O
coefficient N
and O
standard N
error N
are O
as O
followed O
: O

Intercept N
: O
- O
0.3931 O
( O
0.0076 O
) O

Slope N
: O
0.1171 O
( O
0.0022 O
) O

R O
Square N
: O
0.0585 O

Therefore O
I H
could O
not O
estimate O
the O
mean O
reversion N
rate N
as O
the O
estimated O
slope N
has O
the O
positive O
sign O
. O

I H
have O
also O
tried O
monthly O
data N
and O
the O
results N
are O
the O
same O
. O

It O
would O
be O
appreciated O
if O
you H
could O
advice N
me H
on O
this O

Vince H

Thanks N

the O

a O

Right O
now O
, O
we H
are O
in O
the O
process N
of O
evaluating O
both O
our H
new O
hire O
needs O
and O
our H
summer N
needs O
and O
will O
be O
making O
those O
decisions N
after O
the O
first O
of O
the O
year N

Until O
we H
have O
come O
up O
with O
those O
numbers N
it O
would O
be O
premature O
to O
make O
any O
offers O
for O
the O
summer N
. O

What O
I H
would O
like O
to O
do O
in O
this O
case N
is O
get O
the O
information N
to O
Jeff H
Davis H
, O
who O
is O
responsible O
for O
Georgia O
Tech O
and O
ask O
him O
to O
get O
Sungjoo's O

start N
a O

him O
with O
a O
notation N

you H
would O
like O
to O
hire O
him O
for O

When O
we H
start N
the O
summer N
process N

we H
will O
interview N
the O
candidate H

slot O
him O
for O

Is O
this O
okay O

a O
description N
of O
the O

It O
is O
my H
understanding N
that O
some O

removed O

If O
they O
are O

If O

it O

Several O
years N
ago O
I H
developed O
a O
short O
paper N
and O
pencil N
screening N
test O
which O
, O
in O
a O
small O
pilot N
study N
, O
discriminated O
between O
ADHD N
, O
LD O
, O
and O
control N
subjects N
. O

I H
recently O
converted O
this O
test O
to O
an O
online O
test O
in O
order N
to O
norm N
it O
to O
a O
larger O
population N
and O
, O
subsequently O
, O
to O
make O
it O
available O
to O
any O
one O
who O
has O
access N
to O
a O
computer N
and O
the O
Internet N
. O

The O
test O
itself O
is O
what O
is O
called O
a O
substitution N
test O
. O

It O
has O
two O
parts N
, O
both O
of O
which O
are O
timed O
for O
90 O
seconds N
each O
and O
the O
differential N
between O
the O
resulting O
two O
scores N
determines O
the O
likelihood N
of O
having O
a O
learning N
disability N
or O
attention N
deficit N
disorder N
. O

I H
am O
in O
need O
of O
test O
subjects N
and O
hope O
you H
will O
take O
it O
. O

The O
test O
, O
along O
with O
an O
information N
form N
, O
is O
available O
at O
: O
. O

I H
think O
a O
test O
like O
this O
one O
is O
much O
needed O
. O

A O
person H
can O
take O
it O
directly O
instead O
of O
others O
completing O
behavioral O
checklists N
or O
a O
completing O
a O
lengthy O
program N
intensive O
test O
like O
TOVA O
. O

Perhaps O
you H
are O
willing O
to O
recommend O
this O
site N
and O
, O
if O
you H
have O
a O
website N
, O
place N
a O

on O
your H
website N
. O

are O
there O
any O
sadists H
out O
there O
who O
share O
the O
same O
tastes N
as O
i H
do O
? O

i H
dont O
do O
nt O
know O
what O
it O
is O
, O
but O
since O
a O
very O
young O
age N
i H
have O
had O
a O
strange O
but O
very O
gratifying O
urge N
to O
torture N
or O
maime O
animals A
. O

i H
am O
deadly O
serious O
, O
i H
really O
do O
get O
sexual O
releif N
from O
even O
hearing O
of O
torture N
of O
animals A
, O
now O
some O
people N
may N
call O
me H
a O
brute H
or O
a O
coward H
but O
i H
cant O
ca O
nt O
help O
my H
true O
feelings N
. O

badger A
baiting N
is O
natrually O
a O
huge O
turn O
on O
, O
so O
i H
thought O
a O
few O
words N
in O
this O
group N
might O
uncover O
some O
mutual O
enthusiasts H
. O

sincere O
appologies O
to O
anyone O
who O
is O
offended O
by O
my H
request N
but O
my H
request N

Once O
upon O
a O
time N
( O
in O
2001 O
, O
to O
be O
specific O
) O
, O
the O
Coca O
- O
Cola O
corporation N
built O
a O
bottling O
plant N
in O
a O
small O
and O
remote O
Indian O
village N
in O
the O
state N
of O
Kerala O
. O

In O
exchange N
for O
sucking O
vast O
amounts N
of O
water N
out O
of O
the O
local O
land O
, O
the O
mighty O
corporation N
promised O
to O
bring O
the O
people N
great O
wealth N
. O

But O
within O
a O
few O
short O
months N
, O
the O
village N
people N
began O
to O
notice N
their O
wells N
were O
running O
dry O
, O
so O
they O
complained O
to O
the O
corporation N
. O

Coca O
- O
Cola O
calmed O
the O
concerns O
of O
the O
people N
and O
attempted O
to O
win O
back O
their O
favor O
by O
giving O
them O
vast O
amounts N
of O
free O
fertilizer N
, O
saying O
it O
would O
grow O
bountiful O
crops N
beyond O
their O
wildest O
dreams N
. O

After O
several O
years N
of O
use N
, O
we H
arrive O
at O
the O
present O
day N
when O
the O
village N
people N
have O
suddenly O
discovered O
the O
fertilizer N
is O
actually O
the O
bottling O
plant's O
plant N
's H
waste N
sludge N
and O
is O
laden O
with O
cadmium N
, O
a O
highly O
toxic O
, O
cancer N
- O
causing O
heavy O
metal N
. O

The O
village N
soil N
and O
water N
are O
now O
too O
heavily O
contaminated O
to O
safely O
occupy O
human O
life N
, O
so O
the O
plant N
was O
shut O
down O
last O
week N
. O

Moral N
of O
the O
story N
: O
Don't O
Do O
n't O
drink O
Coke O
.......... O
drink O
Pepsi O
! O

Just O
kidding O
, O
Pepsi O
is O
actually O
in O
the O
process N

being O
thrown O
out O
of O
India O
for O

crimes N

well O
. O

The O
Greater O
New O
Orleans O
Fair O
Housing O
Action O
Center O
( O
GNOFHAC O
) O
filed O
a O
housing N
discrimination N
complaint N
against O
the O
Housing O
Authority O
of O
New O
Orleans O
( O
HANO O
) O
last O
week N
. O

The O
complaint N
, O
filed O
with O
the O
United O
States N
Department O
of O
Housing O
and O
Urban O
Development N
, O
accuses O
HANO O
of O
violating O
a O
2003 O
enforcement N
agreement N
entered O
into O
between O
former O
St. O
Thomas O
Housing O

Development N
during O
the O
HOPE O
VI O
redevelopment N
of O
St. O
Thomas O
, O
now O
known O
as O
River O
Garden N
. O

The O
current O
complaints N
allege O
that O
HANO O
has O
not O
provided O
qualified O
former O
St. O
Thomas O
residents H
a O
preference N
with O
respect N
to O
available O
public O
housing N
units N
at O
River O
Garden N
per O
the O
2003 O
agreement N
. O

Upon O
return N
to O
New O
Orleans O
after O
the O
Hurricane O
Katrina O
evacuation N
, O
former O
residents H
have O
been O
informed O
that O
there O
are O
no O
available O
public O
housing N
units N
at O
River O
Garden N
because O
those O
units N
have O
been O
reserved O
for O
HANO O
employees H
. O

Therefore O
, O
public O
housing N
residents H
have O
been O
unable O
to O
secure O
the O
units N
for O
which O
they O
qualified O
prior O
to O
the O
storm O
and O
are O
left O
homeless O
, O
as O
a O
result N
. O

" O
In O
the O
wake O
of O
Hurricane O
Katrina O
, O
affordable O
housing N
in O
New O
Orleans O
is O
more O
scarce O
than O
ever O
. O

As O
such O
, O
it O
is O
essential O
that O

only O

a O

as O
an O
opportunity N

( O

On O
3 O
November O
, O
NASA O
administrator H
Michael H

told O
the O

that O
the O

invest O
about O

500 O

over O
five O

" O
That O
kind N

a O

will O
be O
sufficient O
to O
allow O
substantial O

" O
Griffin H
said O

" O
I H
hope O
that O

if O
put O
to O
the O
test O
, O
can O
do O
better O

than O

, O
but O
I H
do O
not O

, O
" O
Griffin H
added O

Only O

will O
reveal O
whether O
Griffin's O
Griffin H

expectations N

either O
exceeded O
or O
confirmed O

But O
seeing O
how O
the O

been O
able O
to O
successfully O
transport N
civilians H
to O
the O
ISS O
( O
at O

it O

Arafat O

Abbas H
pledged O
to O
fulfill O

dreams N

It O
seems O
that O
the O
Palestinian O
leadership N
( O
upcoming O
) O
will O
not O
be O
a O
peace N
partner H
with O
Israel O
. O

He O
is O
already O
demanding O
claims N
that O
Israel O
said O
no O
to O
not O
only O
the O
world N
, O
but O
to O
Arafat O
himself O
. O

Listing O
his O
priorities N

Abbas H
told O

of O
the O
ruling O
Fatah O
party N
that O
he O
was O
determined O
to O
provide O

continue O
the O
struggle N

Israel's O
Israel O
's H

completed O

barrier N

Abbas H
also O
pledged O
to O
resolve O
the O
problem N
of O
millions N

refugees H

their O
descendants H
. O

Abbas H
, O
a O
refugee H
himself O
from O
what O
is O
today N
the O
northern O
Israeli O
city O
of O
Safed O
, O
called O
the O
refugee H
issue N
" O
very O
important O
and O
very O
dangerous O
. O
" O

Having O
personally O
visited O
the O
West O
Bank O
and O
Israel O
, O
I H
can O
say O
that O
this O
new O
political O
voice N
is O
threatening O
to O
collapse N
the O
peace N
process N
. O

If O
Abbas H
does O
not O
change N
his O
former O
thinking O
and O
continues O
the O
path N
of O
Yasser O
Arafat O
, O
then O
there O
will O
not O
be O
peace N

Holy O

the O
Palestinians O
will O
ultimately O
suffer O

( O
BBC O
) O

The O
Palestinian O
militant O
organisation N
Hamas O
has O
announced O
an O
end N
to O
rocket N
attacks N
on O
Israel O
from O
the O
Gaza O
Strip O
after O
a O
weekend N
of O
escalating O
violence N
. O

Up O
to O
40 O
rockets N
had O
been O
fired O
at O
Israel O
, O
weeks N
after O
its O
military O
withdrew O
from O
the O
territory N
. O

In O
response N
to O
the O
rockets N
, O
Israel O
resumed O
its O
policy N
of O
targeting O
militant O
leaders H
in O
air O
strikes N
. O

Authorised O
by O
Ariel H
Sharon H
to O
make O
" O
unrestricted O
" O
strikes N
, O
its O
military O
launched O
new O
missile N
attacks N
overnight O
. O

It O
looks O
as O
if O
Hamas O
has O
thrown O
in O
the O
towel N
for O
this O
round N
, O
unable O
to O
take O
the O
beating N
the O
Israeli O
Defense O
Forces O
have O
unleashed O
upon O
this O
terrorist H
group N
. O

Mahmoud O
Zahar O
, O
Hamas's O
Hamas O
's H
leader H
declared O
the O
cease N
fire N
after O
Israel O
killed O
it's O
former O
leader H
, O
Muhammed O
Sheikh O
Khalil O
. O

Hamas O
has O
become O
rather O
unpopular O
in O
Gaza O
, O
as O
many O
see O
the O
Israeli O
air O
strikes N
as O
a O
response N
towards O
the O
rocket N
attacks N
upon O
Israeli O
soil N
. O

Egypt O
had O
a O
role N
to O
play O
as O
they O
convinced O
Hamas O
to O
end N
the O
attacks N
, O
although O
the O
same O
can O
not O
be O
said O
of O
Islamic O
Jihad O
. O

( O
Jerusalem O
Post O
) O

" O
We're O
We H
're O
not O
happy O
with O
Hamas's O
Hamas O
's H
position N
at O
this O
stage N
and O
in O
light O
of O
the O
Israeli O
escalation N
against O
the O
Palestinians O
, O
" O
commented O
Khader O
Habib O
, O
a O
senior O
Islamic O
Jihad O
official O
. O

" O
But O
it O
seems O
that O
Hamas O
has O
its O
own O
political O
agenda N
. O
" O

[ O
... O
] O

" O
The O
problem N
is O
not O
with O
the O
Palestinian O
resistance N
groups N
but O
with O
Israel's O
Israel O
's H
scheme N
to O
destroy O
the O
Palestinians' O
Palestinians O
' O
infrastructure N
, O
" O
Habib O
said O
. O

" O
Hamas O
remains O
targeted O
by O
Israel O
, O
as O
in O
the O
past O
, O
and O
the O
Israeli O
occupation N
does O
not O
need O
excuses O
to O
pursue O
its O
aggression N
. O

Israel O
wants O
to O
drive N
the O
Palestinians O
toward O
civil O
war N
. O
" O

Islamic O
Jihad O
has O
refused O
to O
recognized O
the O
cease N
fire N
, O
and O
hopes O
to O
turn O
the O
Gaza O
strip N
" O
into O
a O
vast O
battlefield N
. O
" O

Unless O
President H
Mahmoud O
Abbas H
steps N
in O
, O
Gaza O
will O
probably O
look O
like O
a O
battle N
field O
by O
the O
time N
Israel O
is O
done O
reminding O
Hamas O
of O
their O
critical O
error N
, O
although O
currently O
the O
only O
thing N
Abbas H
is O
doing O
is O
lashing O
out O
and O
refusing O
to O
take O
responsibility N
for O
his O
inability N
to O
act N

Does O

but O
I H
can't O

I H

I H

a O
male H

cockatiel A

and O
there O
are O
2 O
eggs N
in O
the O
bottom O

will O
they O
hatch O
? O

Most O
likely O
not O
, O
if O
there O
is O
not O
a O
bird A
sitting O
on O
the O
eggs N

This O
is O
hard O
to O
tell O
. O

Cockatiels A
can O
lay O
unfertilized O
eggs N
as O
well O
. O

Just O
because O
you H
have O
a O
male H
and O
female O
, O
it O
cannot O
can O
not O
be O
guaranteed O
the O

You H
can O
try O
picking O
up O
the O
eggs N
and O
holding O
it O
up O
against O
a O
very O
bright O
light O
. O

If O
you H
see O
a O
dark O
spot N
in O
the O
egg N

that O
means O
it O
is O
fertilized O
and O
will O
hatch O
if O
cared O

properly O

I've O
I H

I H

a O

what O
does O
it O
mean O
when O
a O
veiled O
chameleon H
egg N

soft O
? O

my H
female O
chameleon H
just O
laid O
eggs N
yesterday N
and O
today N
some O
of O
the O
eggs N
are O
soft O
when O
i H
mean O
soft O
i H
mean O
like O
not O
like O
ordinary O
chameleon H
eggs N
. O

They O
are O
probably O
infertile O
. O

If O
there O
is O
no O
male H
they O
are O
probably O
infertile O
! O

If O
you H
take O
a O
flash N
light O
and O
shine O
it O
through O
the O
eggs N
and O
you H
see O
nothing O
throw O
them O
away O
! O

If O
you H
do O
not O
they O
will O
start N
to O
rot O
! O

If O
she O
has O
no O
male H
to O
fertilize O
the O
eggs N
, O
the O
eggs N
will O
aways O
be O
infertile O
. O

if O
you H
do O
have O
a O
male H
but O
they O
are O
not O
in O
the O
same O
cage N
or O
breeding O
but O
you H
touch O
him O
then O
her O
she O
will O
smell N
his O
sent O
and O
probably O
lay O
eggs N
. O

Hope O
she O
stops O
laying O
eggs N
because O
she O
will O
get O
really O
skinny O
! O

If O
she O
continues O
! O

Hope O
this O
helps O

Is O
it O
better O
to O
book O
a O

online O
or O
by O
a O
travel O
agent H
? O

First O
time N
to O
go O
on O
A O
cruise N
any O
and O
all O
info N
is O
appreciated O

Personally O
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
find O
a O
travel O
agent H
to O
be O
of O
value N
to O
me H
as O
I H
am O
willing O
to O
put O
in O
the O
time N
doing O
research N
on O
the O
internet N
. O

I H
have O
not O
had O
good O
experience O
with O
travel O
agents H
. O

They O
don't O
do O
n't O
seem O
to O
know O
anything O
but O
the O
hype N
they O
are O
told O
and O
the O
packages N
they O
have O
available O
to O
them O
. O

The O
one O
time N
I H
actually O
booked O
through O
a O
travel O
agent H
I H
did O
not O
get O
all O
of O
the O
amenities N
I H
had O
paid O
for O
. O

The O
few O
times N
I H
have O
consulted O
with O
a O
travel O
agent H
I H
was O
able O
to O
find O
the O
same O
for O
less O
on O
my H
own O
, O
and O
more O
options N
than O
what O
they O
were O
selling O
. O

So O
now O
I H
do O
not O
bother O
with O
them O
at O
all O
. O

best O
is O
using O

Well O
last O
night O
while O
I H
was O
sleeping O
, O
my H
hamster A
escaped O
from O
his O
cage N
. O

He O
is O
in O
my H
room N
, O
but O
there O
are O
so O
many O
things N
inside O
there O
, O
I H
dunno O
du O
n O
no O
what O
to O
do O
. O

I H
have O
lots N
of O
containers N
in O
there O
. O

Anybody O
give O
me H
ideas N
like O
a O
trap N
or O
something O
? O

Find O
him O
before O
he O
finds O
the O
dog A
food N
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
kidding O
, O
I H
once O
lost O
a O
hamster A
in O
my H
house N
3 O
months N
later O
I H
walk O
down O
in O
the O
basement N
and O
it O
was O
as O
big O
as O
a O
rat A
. O

It O
had O
been O
eating O
dog A
food N
the O
whole O
time N
. O

It O
was O
huge O
and O
scared O
the O
crap N
out O
of O
me H
. O

Make O
sure O
he O
isn't O
is O
n't O
trapped O
somewhere O
& O
put O
a O
bowl N
of O
food N
out O
. O

He O
will O
come O

can O
i H
have O
some O
indoor O
pet A
ideas N
please O
!!!!!!!!!!!!!? O

i H
want O
a O
small O
indoor O
pet A
that O
my H
mother H
will O
let O
me H
have O
please O
help O

i H
want O
something O
cheap O
east O
to O
take O
care O
of O
and O
something O
to O
hopefully O
fit O
in O
my H
room N

no O
pet A
is O
really O
easy O
to O
take O
care O
of O
. O

they O
all O
need O
love O
and O
attn N
, O
food N
, O
proper O
surroundings O
etc O
. O

the O
easiest O
thing N
would O
be O
a O
fish A
- O
but O
u H
need O
to O
clean O
the O
tank N
weekly O
, O
feed O
it O
the O
right O
amt N
, O
etc O
etc O
x O

Having O
a O
pet A
isn't O
is O
n't O
easy O
. O

You H
should O
treat O
all O
pets A
like O
children H
. O

They O
require O
a O
lot N
of O
attention N
or O
they O
get O
fussy O
and O
tear O
stuff N
up O
. O

If O
you H
want O
easy O
then O
go O
with O
a O
gold N
fish A
or O
hamster A
. O

I H
would O
go O
with O
a O
small O
rodent A
such O
as O
a O
mouse A
, O
rat A
, O
hamster A
or O
gerbil A
if O
you H
want O
something O
you H
can O
handle O
and O
hold N
. O

Fish N
are O
probably O
the O
easiest O
to O
take O
care O
of O
though O

This O

They O

a O

of O

They O
also O
offer O
veggie N

The O

are O
of O
good O
quality N
, O
the O

is O

The O

is O
your H

from O
the O
70's N

I H

the O

when O
I H
went O

my H

There O
is O
something O

maybe O
the O

to O

that O

I H

If O
every O
major O
country N
is O
in O
billions N
( O
if O
not O
trillions N
) O
of O
debt N
, O
where O
are O
they O
borrowing O
from O
? O

You H
can O
borrow O
from O
your H
own O
people N
. O

The O
money N
that O
is O
printed O
is O
FEDERAL O
RESERVE O
( O
thanks N
for O
the O
corrections N
) O
notes N
-- O
it's O
it O
's H
technically O
a O
debt N
that O
the O
Reserve O
owes O
the O
bearer H
of O
the O
note O
( O
but O
printing O
money N
does O
not O
technically O
increase O
the O
debt N
supply N
-- O
the O
role N
of O
money N
has O
changed O
since O
fiat N
currency N
) O
. O

When O
you H
print N
more O
money N
, O
you H
are O
devaluing O
the O
rest N
of O
the O
currency N
that O
is O
already O
in O
circulation N
. O

This O
means O
that O
if O
the O
govt N
decided O
to O
print N
$ O
100,000,000,000,000,000 O
( O
1 O
quadrillion N
dollars N
) O
in O
the O
span N
of O
a O
week N
, O
the O
value N
of O
the O
dollar N
would O
probably O
crash N
pretty O
hard O
( O
probably O
... O
) O
. O

This O
is O
related O
because O
people N
use N
money N
to O
buy O
US O
debt N
-- O
we're O
we H
're O
loaning O
the O
US O
govt N
the O
very O
money N
it O
prints O
. O

The O
only O
reason N
that O
this O
results N
in O
anything O
favorable O
is O
because O
people N
all O
over O
the O
world N
value N
USD O
and O
that O
paper N
currency N
represents O
potential N
labor N
, O
new O
assets N
, O
etc. O

If O
you H
own O
a O
baseball N
card N
of O
Sammy H
Sosa O
, O
there O
is O
a O
chance N
it O
could O
be O
worth O
a O
lot N
of O
money N
. O

Now O
imagine O
if O
the O
card N
company N
just O
mails O
a O
Sammy H
Sosa O
card N
to O
every O
family N
in O
America O
. O

Your H
Sammy H
Sosa O
card N
isn't O
is O
n't O
worth O
anything O
anymore O
because O
there O
are O
so O
many O
of O
them O
and O
everyone O
has O
it O
now O
. O

Now O
imagine O
if O
they O
mailed O
another O
5 O
to O
everyone O
-- O
the O
value N
crashes O
even O
harder O
because O
there O
are O
SO O
many O
of O
them O
now O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
the O
same O
idea N
with O
money N
. O

You H
can't O
ca O
n't O
keep O
printing O
more O
money N
or O
else O
the O
value N
of O
it O
will O
deteriorate O
. O

But O
the O
gov't N
keeps O
issuing O
more O
debt N
and O
we H
still O
look O
at O
$ O
20 O
like O
it's O
it O
's H
$ O
20 O
, O
right O
? O

Eventually O
, O
there O
could O
come O
a O
time N
when O
we H
look O
at O
a O
$ O
20 O
bill N
and O
it O
means O
nothing O
to O
us H
. O

This O
is O
what O
happened O
in O
Zimbabwe O
where O
a O
billion O
dollar N
transaction N
might O
happen O
for O
a O
loaf N
of O
bread N
. O

They O
printed O
so O
much O
money N
( O
without O
proper O
secure O
backing N
by O
the O
gov't N
) O
that O
it O
just O
became O
worthless O
. O

So O
they O
started O
to O
just O
increase O
the O
numbers N
on O
their O
currency N
so O
you H
can O
actually O
pay O
for O
something O
. O

Because O
the O
gov't N
theoretically O
owes O
its O
population N
money N
, O
they O
issue N
paper N
as O
a O
certificate N
of O
this O
. O

You H
might O
not O
have O
physically O
went O
to O
the O
bank N
and O
traded O
something O
in O
return N
for O
paper N
but O
you H
did O
something O
that O
warranted O
the O
earning O
of O
that O
dollar N
. O

If O
you H
work N
for O
a O
company N
, O
they O
pay O
you H
that O
money N
because O
it O
has O
value N
and O
you H
can O
buy O
things N
with O
it O
. O

The O
only O
reason N
it O
has O
value N
is O
because O
the O
US O
gov't N
says N
it O
does O
. O

You H
can O
pay O
gov't N
- O
related O
fees N
and O
bills N
with O
the O
money N
they O
issue N
and O
because O
the O
gov't N
is O
well O
- O
secured O
, O
people N
accept O
it O
. O

If O
our H
gov't N
was O
unstable O
, O
no O
one O
would O
trust O
the O
dollars N
they O
slept O
under O
for O
warmth N
because O
the O
gov't N
could O
just O
come O
out O
and O
say O
, O
' O
Sorry O
we're O
we H
're O
not O
paying O
you H
guys H
back O
' O
. O

Well O
what O
would O
they O
be O
paying O
back O
? O

To O
whom O
are O
they O
paying O
back O
to O
? O

It O
used O
to O
be O
gold N
. O

But O
as O
we H
grew O
as O
a O
planet N
, O
we H
ran O
out O
of O
gold N
to O
back O
every O
dollar N
with O
and O
it O
just O
became O
a O
nightmare N
to O
handle O
. O

Enter O
, O
fiat N
currency N
, O
a O
piece N
of O
paper N
that O
means O
nothing O
except O
what O
the O
gov't N
says N
it O
means O
. O

People N
used O
to O
go O
to O
banks N
with O
gold N
and O
receive O
' O
money N
' O
for O
it O
. O

The O
banks N
would O
literally O
hold N
their O
gold N
and O
give O
them O
an O
certificate N
that O
says N
they O
own O
a O
claim N
of O
gold N
in O
their O
vaults N
. O

If O
ANYONE O
brought O
that O
certificate N
to O
the O
bank N
, O
they O
could O
expect O
to O
receive O
gold N
for O
it O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
what O
gave O
it O
value N
. O

You H
could O
say O
you H
want O
that O
farmer's O
farmer H
's H
potatoes N
and O
he O
can O
go O
get O
$ O
1 O
of O
gold N
from O
the O
bankers H
at O
his O
convenience N
or O
he O
could O
hold N
onto O
it O
and O
use N
it O
just O
like O
the O
person H
did O
before O
him O
-- O
' O
trade N
' O
it O
for O
something O
else O
like O
new O
shoes N
. O

Why O
? O

Because O
everyone O
liked O
gold N
and O
everyone O
believed O
gold N
had O
value N
. O

Eventually O
, O
this O
took O
off O
and O
people N
stopped O
trading O
for O
things N
and O
we H
developed O
currency N
with O
quantitative O
values N
that O
allowed O
for O
easy O
exchanges N
to O
take O
place N
. O

So O
you H
might O
think O
, O
' O
Well O
, O
now O
that O
there O
isn't O
is O
n't O
gold N
behind O
my H
dollar N
, O
how O
is O
it O
worth O
anything O
even O
if O
the O
gov't N
say O
it O
is O
? O
They O
won't O
wo O
n't O
give O
me H
anything O
in O
return N
for O
it O
" O
. O

The O
same O
thing N
applies O
to O
gold N
. O

No O
one O
wants O
gold N
unless O
other O
people N
want O
gold N
. O

If O
you H
can't O
ca O
n't O
reasonably O
trade N
your H
gold N
for O
something O
else O
, O
then O
what O
value N
does O
it O
have O
? O

( O
Someone O
did O
point N
out O
you H
can O
shave O
gold N
flakes N
into O
your H
water N
and O
drink O
it O
, O
like O
some O
companies N
have O
chosen O
to O
do O
, O
but O
that's O
that O
's H
on O
you H
) O

As O
long O
as O
people N
continue O
to O
value N
dollars N
, O
it O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
matter N
what O
it's O
it O
's H
worth O
, O
sans O
some O
certain O
supply N
and O
demand N
laws N
. O

So O
gold N
is O
no O
different O
in O
that O
regard N
. O

The O
ONE O
difference N
between O
paper N
currency N
and O
gold N
is O
that O
$ O
100,000 O
in O
cash O
weighs O
a O
lot N
less O
than O
$ O
100,000 O
in O
gold N
and O
is O
a O
lot N
easier O
to O
hide O
too O
. O

EDIT O
: O

I H
made O
some O
slight O
revisions N
to O
correct O
errors N
and O
to O
try O
and O
relate O
things N
better O
to O
the O
main O
topic N
at O
hand N
. O

Sorry O
, O
I H
kinda O
started O
rambling O
. O

I H
have O
also O
posted O
below O
in O
response N
to O
u/penny_eater O
to O
correct O
my H
errors N
and O
explain O
them O
in O
a O
little O
bit N
further O
detail N
but O
it O
kinda O
strays O
away O
from O
ELI5 O
territory N
. O

This O
kinda O
seems O
all O
over O
the O
place N
but O
it O
should O
be O
good O
starter H
information N
for O
someone O
trying O
to O
understand O
debt N
markets N
and O
macroeconomics N
, O
in O
general O
. O

Monetary O
supply N
and O
debt N
are O
pretty O
hand N
- O
in O
- O
hand N
, O
even O
if O
they're O
they O
're O
not O
exactly O
the O
same O
thing N
. O

Larger O
and O
more O
complex O
economies N
warranted O
the O
development N
of O
fiat N
currency N
which O
ultimately O
changed O
the O
role N
of O
currency N
, O
in O
general O
. O

It O
no O
longer O
represents O
a O
claim N
, O
per O
se O
, O
but O
it O
represents O
value N
because O
the O
gov't N
says N
it O
has O
value N
and O
will O
accept O
it O
for O
gov't N
related O
transactions N
and O
business N
with O
foreign O
entities N
. O

Also O
, O
don't O
do O
n't O
get O

on O
the O
petrodollar O
. O

Humans A
are O
the O
only O
species A
on O
earth N
to O
try O
and O
stop N
themselves O
from O
reproducing O

Pandas A
do O
a O
fine O
job N
of O
avoiding O
reproduction N
, O
too O
. O

The O
lazy O
bastards H
. O

I H
read O
a O
good O
source N
( O
another O
reddit O
comment O
) O
which O
stated O
that O
pandas A
being O
notoriously O
poor O
at O
reproducing O
is O
a O
myth N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
just O
that O
getting O
any O
species A
in O
captivity N
to O
reproduce O
is O
a O
challenge N
, O
so O
that's O
that O
's H
why O
getting O
pandas A
in O
captivity N
to O
reproduce O
is O
a O
challenge N
too O
. O

And O
in O
the O
wild O
they O
would O
reproduce O
just O
fine O
, O
the O
largest O
threat N
to O
their O
reproduction N
is O
the O
narrowing N
of O
their O
ecosystems N
by O
humans A
, O
not O
their O
poor O
talent N
in O
reproducing O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
true O
. O

Zoos N
in O
China O
with O
larger O
panda A
populations N
also O
have O
far O
fewer O
problems N
getting O
them O
to O
breed A
. O

A O
little O
bit N
of O
male H
competition N
really O
helps O
. O

Yup O
... O
here O
it O
is O

In O
times N
of O
poor O
food N
availability N
, O
white O
tail N
deer A
stop N
/ O
slow O
reproduction N
. O

I H
assume O
that O
it O
also O
happens O
elsewhere O
. O

There O
was O
an O
experiment N
that O
was O
done O
with O
a O
rat A
population N
which O
was O
raised O
in O
an O
environment N
of O
artificial O
high O
abundance N
of O
food N
, O
water N
, O
etc. O

The O
population N
grew O
rapidly O
until O
space N
became O
scarce O
, O
then O
many O
of O
the O
rats A
exhibited O
complete O
disinterest N
in O
sex N
/ O
reproduction N
which O
persisted O
even O
as O
population N
size N
decreased O
, O
causing O
a O
collapse N
of O
the O
rat A
society N
. O

Nah O
they’re O

I H
love O
all O
these O
comments N
telling O
OP O
he's O
he O
's H
wrong O
. O

I H
think O
I H
read O
that O
if O
food N
was O
low O
, O
rabbits A
will O
abort O
their O
young O
and O
reabsorb O
them O
. O

We're O
We H
're O
the O
only O
animal A
that O
does O
it O
consciously O
. O

That O
we H
know O
of O
. O

But O
to O
be O
fair N
, O
we're O
we H
're O
the O
only O
animal A
that O
does O
anything O
consciously O
which O
involves O
deep O
planning N
. O

That O
we H
know O
of O
. O

Plot N
twist N
: O
cats A
are O
the O
smartest O
species A
on O
earth N
and O
will O
overthrow O
humans A
when O
we H
realize O
that O
we’re O
we H
’re O
their O
servants H
. O

... O
and O
for O
good O
reason N
. O

What O
about O
the O
Ai N
currently O
proliferating O
through O
our H
computer N
networks N
? O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
they O
count O
? O
? O
? O

WHERE O
IS O
YOUR H
HEART N
? O
! O
? O
! O

We’re O
We H
’re O
too O
fucking O
good O
at O
it O
. O

How O
would O
we H
know O
? O

Perhaps O
other O
species A
went O
extinct O
because O
they O
stopped O
reproducing O
. O

But O
did O
they O
do O
so O
planningly O
? O

And O
eating O

But O
we H
still O
like O
to O
practice O
. O

I H
think O
it's O
it O
's H
coyotes A
that O
will O
howl O
at O
certain O
times N
and O
listen O
for O
responses N
to O
decide O
if O
an O
area N
is O
over O
populated O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
that O
means O
they O
go O
somewhere O
else O
to O
hump O
or O
just O
stay O
where O
they O
are O
and O
don't O
do O
n't O
hump O
. O

In O
our H
defense N
human O
babies H
are O
the O
worst O
of O
all O
the O
species A
. O

How O
would O
we H
know O
that O
they O
didn’t O
did O
n’t O
? O

It’s O
It O
’s O
not O
to O
prove O
that O
they O
did O
, O
just O
stating O
that O
the O
option N
is O
there O
. O

It’s O
It O
’s O
not O
provable O
or O
unprovable O
. O

Yeah O
other O
animals A
just O
eat O
their O
babies H

This O
has O
to O
do O
with O
the O
fact N
that O
raising O
our H
offspring H
is O
labor N
and O
resource N
intensive O
. O

Many O
species A
can O
walk O
minutes N
after O
birth N
. O

Due O
to O
the O
size N
of O
our H
heads N
and O
the O
limited O
size N
of O
the O
birth N
canal N
, O
humans A
are O
born O
relatively O
premature O
. O

Those O
children H
then O
have O
to O
be O
taken O

This O
is O
even O
more O
pronounced O
in O
prosperous O
societies N
where O
only O
one O
or O
two O
children H
are O
even O
needed O

can O
legitimately O

Introduction N

Research N
on O
adult H
- O
learned O
second O
language N
( O
L2 O
) O
has O
provided O
considerable O
insight N
into O
the O
neurocognitive O
mechanisms N
underlying O
the O
learning N
and O
processing N
of O
L2 O
grammar N
[ O
1 O
] O
– O
[ O
11 O
] O
. O

Of O
interest N
here O
, O
studies N
suggest O
that O
, O
despite O
the O
difficulties N
in O
acquiring O
L2 O
grammar N
, O
adult H
learners H
can O
approximate O
native O
- O
like O
levels N
of O
use N
and O
neurocognitive O
processing N
[ O
12 O
] O
– O
[ O
15 O
] O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
not O
enough O
to O
have O
attained O
such O
native O
- O
like O
levels N
. O

Crucially O
, O
it O
is O
also O
desirable O
to O
retain O
them O
, O
even O
in O
the O
absence N
of O
continued O
practice O
or O
exposure N
to O
the O
L2 O
. O

In O
fact N
, O
substantial O
periods N
( O
months N
to O
years N
) O
of O
limited O
or O
no O
exposure N
following O
L2 O
training O
are O
not O
uncommon O
, O
and O
may N
even O
be O
the O
norm N
[ O
16 O
] O
. O

Such O
a O
scenario N
may N
be O
found O
in O
different O
situations N
, O
including O
when O
one O
studies N
a O
language N
in O
a O
classroom N
and O
then O
stops O
taking O
classes N
[ O
17 O
] O
, O
[ O
18 O
] O
and O
when O
one O
is O
immersed O
in O
a O
foreign O
language N
setting N
and O
then O
moves O
away O
[ O
19 O
] O
. O

In O
the O
present O
study N
, O
we H
examine O
the O
outcomes N
of O
such O
a O
period N
of O
no O
exposure N
on O
the O
neurocognition O
of O
L2 O
grammar N
: O
that O
is O
, O
whether O
a O
substantial O
period N
of O
no O
exposure N
leads O
to O
decreased O
proficiency N
and O
/ O
or O
less O
native O
- O
like O
neural O
processes N
( O
“ O
use N
it O
or O
lose O
it O
” O
[ O
20 O
] O
) O
, O
no O
such O
changes O
, O
or O
perhaps O
whether O
even O
higher O
proficiency N
and O
/ O
or O
more O
native O
- O
like O
processing N
may N
be O
observed O
. O

Additionally O
, O
we H
test O
whether O
any O
such O
outcomes N
might O
vary O
as O
a O
function N
of O
the O
type N
of O
L2 O
training O
, O
in O
particular O
between O
classroom N
- O
like O
and O
immersion N
- O
like O
contexts N
. O

Previous O
Research N

We H
are O
aware O
of O
six O
studies N
designed O
to O
investigate O
the O
effects N
of O
a O
substantial O
period N
of O
limited O
exposure N
following O
adult H
L2 O
training O
[ O
17 O
] O
, O
[ O
18 O
] O
, O
[ O
21 O
] O
– O
[ O
24 O
] O
, O
all O
of O
which O
were O
restricted O
to O
the O
examination N
of O
behavioral O
( O
performance N
) O
outcomes N
. O

( O
Note O
that O
we H
do O
not O
consider O
case N
studies N
, O
purely O
observational O
data N
, O
or O
research N
on O
L2s O
acquired O
by O
children H
; O
for O
a O
comprehensive O
review N
, O
see O
[ O

The O
six O
studies N
tested O
L2 O
learners H
after O
periods N
of O
1 O
month N
to O
50 O
years N
of O
limited O
L2 O
exposure N
, O
mainly O
on O
general O
language N
skills N
[ O
17 O
] O
, O
[ O
18 O
] O
, O
[ O
21 O
] O
, O
[ O
23 O
] O
, O
[ O
24 O
] O
, O
though O
also O
on O
more O
specific O
paradigms N
meant O
to O
target N
aspects N
of O
grammatical O
abilities N
[ O
17 O
] O
, O
[ O
18 O
] O
or O
lexical O
abilities N
[ O
22 O
] O
, O
[ O
23 O
] O
. O

These O
language N
measures N
were O
compared O
in O
most O
studies N
to O
the O
same O
measures N
in O
a O
different O
set O
of O
subjects N
who O
had O
not O
experienced O
a O
period N
of O
limited O
exposure N
[ O
17 O
] O
, O
[ O
18 O
] O
, O
[ O
22 O
] O
, O
[ O
23 O
] O
, O
or O
to O
retrospective O
ratings N
of O
the O
same O
subjects N
[ O
21 O
] O
, O
with O
only O
one O
longitudinal O
study N
testing O
the O
same O
subjects N
before O
and O
after O
a O
period N
of O
limited O
exposure N
[ O
24 O
] O
. O

Across O
the O
studies N
, O
the O
periods N
of O
limited O
exposure N
followed O
either O
classroom N
training O
[ O
17 O
] O
, O
[ O
18 O
] O
, O
[ O
22 O
] O
, O
[ O
24 O
] O
or O
mixed O
classroom N
and O
immersion N
training O
[ O
21 O
] O
, O
[ O
23 O
] O
, O
[ O
24 O
] O
. O

The O
training O
lasted O
varying O
lengths N
of O
time N
, O
apparently O
usually O
in O
the O
range N
of O
a O
few O
years N
, O
and O
resulted O
in O
seemingly O
varying O
proficiency N
levels N
( O
though O
not O
directly O
measured O
, O
except O
by O
[ O
24 O
] O
) O
prior O
to O
the O
period N
of O
limited O
exposure N
. O

Overall O
, O
the O
results N
of O
the O
six O
studies N
have O
been O
taken O
to O
suggest O
the O
following O
. O

A O
period N
of O
limited O
exposure N
generally O
leads O
to O
attrition N
( O
loss N
) O
of O
L2 O
performance N
or O
knowledge N
[ O
17 O
] O
, O
[ O
18 O
] O
, O
[ O
21 O
] O
, O
[ O
23 O
] O
. O

Such O
loss N
has O
been O
observed O
after O
as O
little O
as O
a O
few O
months N
of O
limited O
exposure N
, O
e.g. O
, O
after O
a O
1 O
- O
7 O
month N
[ O
23 O
] O
or O
6 O
month N
delay N
[ O
21 O
] O
, O
as O
well O
as O
after O
2 O
years N
[ O
18 O
] O
, O
though O
in O
one O
case N
it O
was O
observed O
only O
by O
3 O
- O
5 O
years N
, O
and O
not O
earlier O
[ O
17 O
] O
. O

Although O
attrition N
may N
take O
place N
within O
the O
first O
few O
years N
, O
some O
studies N
suggest O
that O
it O
then O
appears O
to O
level N
off O
, O
with O
no O
further O
losses N
occurring O
[ O
17 O
] O
, O
[ O
18 O
] O
. O

Higher O
levels N
of O
proficiency N
( O
or O
exposure N
) O
may N
be O
associated O
with O
less O
attrition N
[ O
17 O
] O
, O
[ O
18 O
] O
, O
[ O
21 O
] O
, O
[ O
23 O
] O
or O
even O
with O
no O
observed O
losses N
[ O
21 O
] O
. O

Moreover O
, O
one O
study N
found O
no O
changes O
at O
all O
in O
performance N
, O
across O
proficiency N
levels N
, O
after O
either O
2 O
or O
4 O
years N
of O
limited O
exposure N
[ O
22 O
] O
. O

Finally O
, O
in O
some O
cases N
a O
gain O
in O
performance N
has O
been O
observed O
: O
after O
1.5 O
years N
of O
limited O
exposure N
in O
one O
study N
, O
particularly O
for O
L2 O
learners H
with O
immersion N
as O
well O
as O
classroom N
training O
[ O
24 O
] O
, O
and O
observed O
in O
another O
study N
after O
2 O
years N
, O
though O
only O
for O
some O
abilities N
, O
such O
as O
listening O
and O
reading N
comprehension N
[ O
18 O
] O
. O

It O
remains O
unclear O
what O
might O
explain O
such O
gains N
, O
which O
have O
been O
attributed O
to O
motivation N
and O
to O
L2 O
experience O
during O
the O
period N
of O
ostensibly O
limited O
exposure N
[ O
24 O
] O
, O
or O
to O
factors N
related O
to O
general O
maturation N
, O
cognitive O
development N
, O
or O
continued O
academic O
training O

In O
2015 O
, O
an O
initiative N
was O
started O
to O
set O
up O
a O
Dutch O
speaking O
DH+Lib O
community N
in O
the O
Netherlands O
and O
Belgium O
, O
based O
on O
the O
example N
of O
the O
American O
communal O
space N
of O
librarians H
, O
archivists H
, O
LIS O
graduate H
students H
, O
and O
information N
specialists H
to O
discuss O
topics N
‘ O
Where O
the O
Digital O
Humanities O
and O
Libraries O
meet O
’ O
. O

At O
the O
initial O
meeting O
it O
became O
apparent O
that O
most O
participants H
were O
there O
to O
learn O
more O
about O
digital O
humanities N
and O
were O
not O
( O
yet O
) O
in O
the O
situation N
where O
they O
were O
able O
to O
offer O
expertise N
on O
the O
subject N
. O

On O
the O
administrative O
level N
, O
the O
directors H
of O
the O
libraries N
participating O
in O
the O
consortium N
of O
Dutch O
academic O
libraries N
( O
UKB O
) O
also O
expressed O
the O
wish O
that O
librarians H
become O
more O
fluent O
in O
DH O
. O

A O
year N
later O
, O
the O
National O
Library O
of O
the O
Netherlands O
( O
Koninklijke O
Bibliotheek O
) O
, O
and O
the O
University O
Library O
of O
the O
Vrije O
Universiteit O
Amsterdam O
again O
concluded O
that O
librarians H
at O
their O
institutes N
who O
wanted O
to O
get O
involved O
in O
DH O
needed O
more O
training O
to O
adequately O
support N
researchers H
and O
students H
in O
this O
field O
. O

Therefore O
both O
institutes N
joined O
forces N
to O
develop O
a O
set O
of O
clinics N
on O
DH O
for O
librarians H
. O

The O
two O
institutes N
were O
later O
joined O
by O
the O
Leiden O
University O
Libraries O
. O

We H
see O
this O
as O
the O
ideal O
opportunity N
to O
provide O
these O
educative O
sessions N
not O
only O
to O
our H
own O
librarians H
, O
but O
also O
to O
the O
academic O
librarians H
of O
other O
Dutch O
research N
libraries N
. O

In O
essence N
, O
we H
want O
to O
teach O
our H
country’s O
country N
’s O
librarians H
the O
ins N
and O
outs N
of O
DH O
in O
order N
for O
them O
to O
take O
up O
their O
natural O
role N
of O
facilitating O
and O
supporting O
research N
and O
ideally O
become O
the O
research N
partner H
needed O
in O
DH O
projects N
. O

The O
aim N
of O
these O
clinics N
is O
to O
provide O
basic O
methodological O
competencies N
and O
technical O
skills N
in O
DH O
, O
for O
a O
diverse O
group N
of O
librarians H
, O
consisting O
of O
both O
subject N
and O
technical O
librarians H
with O
basic O
technical O
skills N
. O

The O
content N
of O
these O
sessions N
should O
enable O
them O
to O
provide O
services N
to O
researchers H
and O
students H
, O
identify O
remaining O
gaps N
in O
knowledge N
or O
skills N
that O
they O
could O
address N
by O
self N
- O
directed O
learning N
and O
( O
perhaps O
) O
to O
automate O
their O
daily O
library N
work N
. O

We H
are O
not O
setting N
out O
to O
turn O
them O
into O
programmers H
or O
data N
crunchers O
, O
but O
want O
to O
boost O
their O
knowledge N
level N
to O
where O
they O
feel O
comfortable O
providing O
information N
about O
DH O
projects N
, O
follow O
the O
literature N
and O
research N
, O
follow O
online O
tutorials N
and O
hopefully O
take O
up O
the O
challenge N
of O
finishing O
this O
professional O
development N
by O
engaging O
with O
the O
DH O
community N
. O

In O
order N
to O
design N
this O
curriculum N
we H
follow O
a O
four O
step N
approach N
with O
a O
Working O
Out O
Loud O

( O
Williams H

on O

in O
their O

and O

. O

With O
these O
in O
hand N
, O
we H
will O
design N
the O
curriculum N
of O
clinics N
, O
based O
on O
the O
method N
of O
' O
constructive O
alignment N
' O
( O
Biggs O
et O
al. O
, O
2011 O
) O
, O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
the O
intended O
learning N
objectives N
and O
the O
teaching O
/ O
learning N
activities N
stay O
aligned O
. O

Our H
plan N
is O
to O
organize O
a O
maximum N
of O
6 O
clinics N
, O
each O
one O
full O
day N
. O

Each O
day N
starts O
with O
one O
or O
more O
lectures N
by O
researchers H
, O
that O
address N
the O
conceptual O
knowledge N
needed O
. O

The O
afternoon N
sessions N
will O
be O
devoted O
to O
the O
hands N
- O
on O
training O
of O
skills N
, O
following O
the O
Library O
Carpentry O
model N
as O
closely O
as O
possible O
. O

By O
having O
researchers H
provide O
the O
lecture N
sessions N
, O
we H
hope O
to O
fuel O
the O
enthusiasm N
of O
the O
librarians H
with O
the O
inspiration N
of O
direct O
contact N
with O
researchers H
and O
to O
provide O
access N
to O
a O
network N
within O
and O
across O
universities N
. O

With O
these O
clinics N
, O
we H
hope O
to O
initiate O
a O
stream N
of O
DH O
activities N
in O
Dutch O
universities N
, O
making O
access N
to O
support N
easier O
for O
new O
digital O
scholars H
. O

Education N
and O
early O
loves N

Byron H
received O
his O
early O
formal O
education N
at O
Aberdeen O
Grammar O
School O
, O
and O
in O
August O
1799 O
entered O
the O
school N

Placed O
under O
the O

of O
a O
Dr. O
Bailey H

he O
was O
encouraged O
to O
exercise N
in O
moderation N
but O
not O
restrain O
himself O
from O
" O
violent O
" O
bouts N
in O
an O
attempt N
to O
overcompensate O
for O
his O
deformed O
foot N

His O
mother H
interfered O
with O
his O
studies N
, O
often O
withdrawing O
him O
from O
school N
, O
with O
the O
result N
that O
he O
lacked O
discipline N
and O
his O
classical O
studies N
were O
neglected O
. O

In O
1801 O

he O
met O
while O
at O
school N

and O
she O
was O
the O
reason N
he O
refused O
to O
return N
to O
Harrow O
in O
September O
1803 O
. O

His O
mother H
wrote O
, O
" O
He O
has O
no O
indisposition N

I H
know O

his O

feelings N

" O
[ O

Byron H
finally O
returned O
in O
January O
1804 O
, O
[ O

] O
to O
a O
more O
settled O
period N
which O
saw O
the O
formation N
of O
a O
circle N
of O
emotional O
involvements N
with O
other O
Harrow O
boys H

which O
he O
recalled O
with O
great O
vividness N

a O

some O

impulse N

up O

where O
he O
met O

the O
younger O
John H

About O
his O
" O
protégé O

wrote O

" O

been O
my H
almost O
constant O
associate H
since O
October O

him O

In O
his O

Byron H
composed O
Thyrza O

a O
series N

In O

he O
described O
the O
affair N

" O
a O
violent O

though O
pure O
love O

passion N

This O
statement N

however O
, O
needs O
to O
be O
read O
in O
the O
context N

hardening O
public O
attitudes N

the O
severe O

in O
contrast N

the O
( O

) O
more O

He O
later O
expanded O

as O

Born O
in O

He O
had O
no O
political O
power N

his O
influence N
extended O
only O
so O
far O
as O
he O
was O
humored O
by O
those O
around O
him O
; O

nevertheless O
, O
he O
was O
treated O
deferentially O

, O
and O
currency N
issued O
in O
his O
name N
was O
honored O
in O
the O

Though O
some O
considered O
him O

eccentric O
, O

celebrated O
his O
regal O
presence N

that O

and O
drowned O
earthworms A
. O

And O
it O
has O
, O
because O
it O
is O
spring N
and O
inside O
the O
ground N
something O
is O
stirring O
. O

I H
was O
wearing O
a O
yellow O
linen N
dress N
which O
my H
mother H
had O
picked O
out O
and O
which O
I H
therefore O
disliked O
although O
I H
knew O
it O
flattered O
me H
. O

My H
shoes N
were O
white O
and O
I H
was O
concentrating O
on O
keeping O
them O
out O
of O
the O
mud N
. O

My H
father H
and O
I H
were O
going O
to O
mass N
— O
my H
mother H
did O
not O
go O
; O
she O
was O
Protestant O
. O

My H
father H
put O
his O
hand N
on O
top O
of O
my H
hair N
, O
his O
palm N
on O
my H
head N
, O
and O
I H
could O
feel O
the O
bone N
of O
my H
skull N
and O
my H
skin N
and O
his O
hot O
palm N
, O
so O
dry O
and O
strong O
. O

When O
I H
was O
a O
little O
girl H
, O
he O
did O
that O
often O
, O
and O
called O
me H
Muscles O
. O

He O
had O
not O
called O
me H
Muscles O
or O
put O
his O
hand N
on O
my H
head N
for O
a O
long O
time N
. O

I H
could O
not O
help O
arching O
my H
back O
a O
little O
, O
I H
wanted O
to O
push O
against O
his O
hand N
like O
a O
cat A
but O
the O
instinct N
that O
comes O
with O
being O
thirteen O
, O
the O
half O
- O
understood O
caution N
that O
makes O
a O
girl H
timid O
, O
or O
wild O
, O
the O
shyness N
told O
me H
to O
just O
walk O
. O

I H
wanted O
to O
feel O
the O
rough O
edge N
of O
the O
pocket N
of O
his O
coat N
against O
my H
cheek N
, O
but O
I H
was O
too O
tall O
. O

I H
wanted O
to O
be O
seven O
again O
, O
and O
safe O
. O

But O
I H
still O
wanted O
to O
push O
against O
his O
hand N
and O
put O
my H
hand N
in O
his O
pocket N
and O
steal O
the O
leather N
palmed O
glove N
, O
that O
secret N
animal A
. O

Instead O
I H
went O
into O
the O
church N
, O
took O
a O
Bulletin N
, O
dipped O
my H
finger N
in O
Holy O
Water N
and O
genuflected O
. O

The O
inside O
of O
the O
church N
smelled O
like O
damp O
wood N
and O
furniture N
polish N
, O
not O
alive O
at O
all O
. O

My H
father H
took O
off O
his O
coat N
and O
draped O
it O
over O
the O
edge N
of O
the O
pew N
and O
when O
I H
came O
back O
from O
communion N
I H
stole O
his O
glove N
. O

The O
paper N
taste N
of O
the O
wafer N
was O
still O
in O
my H
mouth N
and O
I H
took O
a O
deep O
breath N
of O
the O
leather N
. O

It O
smelled O
like O
March O
. O

We H
walked O
back O
through O
the O
school N
because O
it O
was O
drizzling O
, O
my H
father H
tall O
in O
his O
navy N
suit N
and O
my H
shoes N
going O
click N
on O
the O
linoleum N
. O

There O
were O
two O
classes N
of O
each O
grade N
, O
starting O
at O
the O
sixth O
and O
going O
down O
to O
the O
first O
. O

The O
hall N
ended O
in O
a O
T H
and O
we H
went O
left O
through O
the O
gym N
, O
walked O
underneath O
the O
bleachers H
and O
stood O
next O
to O
the O
side N
door N
, O
waiting O
for O
the O
rain N
to O
stop N
. O

It O
was O
dark O
under O
the O
bleachers H
. O

My H
father H
was O
a O
young O
man H
, O
thirty O
- O
five O
, O
younger O
because O
he O
liked O
to O
be O
outside O
, O
to O
play O
softball N
on O
Saturday N
and O
to O
take O
my H
mother H
and O
me H
camping O
on O
vacation N
. O

He O
stood O
rocked O
back O
on O
his O
heels N
with O
his O
coat N
thrown O
over O
his O
shoulders N
and O
his O
hands N
in O
his O
pockets N
. O

I H
thought O
of O
bacon N
and O
eggs N
, O
toast N
with O
peach N
jam N
out O
of O
the O
jar N
. O

I H
was O
so O
hungry O
. O

The O
space N
under O
the O
bleachers H
was O
secret N
and O
dark O
. O

There O
were O
things N
in O
the O
shadows N
; O
a O
metal N
pail N
, O
a O
mop N
, O
rags N
. O

Next O
to O
the O
door N
was O
a O
tall O
wrought O
- O
iron N
candle N
holder N
— O
the O
kind N
that O
stood O
at O
either O
end N
of O
the O
altar N
. O

There O
was O
no O
holder N
and O
the O
end N
was O
jagged O
. O

On O
the O
floor N
was O
a O
wrapper N
from O
a O
French O
Chew O
. O

They O
were O
sold O
at O
eighth O
- O
grade N
basketball N
games N
on O
Friday N
nights N
. O

The O
light O
from O
the O
door N
made O
the O
shadows N
under O
the O
bleachers H
darker O
, O
the O
long O
space N
stretched O
far O
away O
. O

I H
heard O
the O
rain N
and O
the O
faint O
rustle N
of O
paper N
and O
smelled O
damp O
concrete N
. O

I H
did O
not O
go O
near O
my H
father H
but O
kept O
my H
hand N
in O
my H
pocket N
, O
feeling N
the O
soft O
leather N
glove N
. O

There O
was O
a O
rustling N
on O
the O
concrete N
and O
the O
drizzle N
of O
soft O
rain N
. O

I H
wondered O
if O
anyone O
ever O
went O
back O
under O
the O
bleachers H
, O
if O
there O
were O
crickets A
or O
mice A
there O
. O

The O
rustling N
might O
have O
been O
mice A
. O

I H
wished O
the O
rain N
would O
stop N
. O

I H
wanted O
to O
go O
home N
. O

I H
made O
noises N
with O
my H
heels N
but O
they O
were O
too O
loud O
so O
I H
stopped O
. O

Something O
else O
clicked O
and O
I H
tried O
to O
see O
what O
it O
was O
but O
couldn’t O
could O
n’t O
see O
anything O
. O

It O
wasn’t O
was O
n’t O
as O
loud O
as O
my H
heels N
. O

My H
father H
cleared O
his O
throat N
, O
looking O
out O
the O
door N
. O

I H
imagined O
a O
man H
down O
there O
in O
the O
dark O
, O
an O
escaped O
convict O
or O
a O
madman H
. O

It O
had O
nearly O
stopped O
raining O
. O

In O
fifteen O
minutes N
we H
would O
be O
home N
and O
my H
mother H
would O
fry O
eggs N
. O

I H
heard O
a O
noise N
like O
paper N
. O

My H
father H
heard O
it O
, O
too O
, O
but O
he O
pretended O
not O
to O
, O
at O
least O
he O
didn’t O
did O
n’t O
turn O
his O
head N
. O

And O
there O
was O
a O
heavier O
sound O
, O
a O
rasp N
, O
like O
a O
box N
pulled O
over O
concrete N
. O

I H
looked O
at O
my H
father H
but O
he O
didn’t O
did O
n’t O
turn O
his O
head N
. O

I H
wished O
he O
would O
turn O
his O
head N
. O

There O
was O
a O
click N
again O
and O
the O
rustle N
, O
and O
I H
could O
not O
think O
of O
what O
it O
could O
be O
. O

I H
had O
no O
explanation N
for O
the O
particular O
combination N
of O
sounds N
. O

No O
doubt N
there O
was O
, O
some O
two O
things N
that O
happened O
to O
be O
making O
noises N
at O
the O
same O
time N
. O

Once O
in O
a O
fever N
I H
heard O
thousands N
of O
birds A
outside O
my H
window N
and O
I H
was O
terrified O
that O
they O
would O
fling O
themselves O
through O
the O
glass N
and O
attack O
me H
, O
but O
it O
was O
only O
the O
rain N
on O
the O
eaves O
. O

Chapter O
Two O
: O
Master H
Lunre O

My H
father’s O
father H
’s O
actions N
were O
largely O
incomprehensible O
to O
me H
, O
guided O
by O
his O
own O
secret N
and O
labyrinthine O
calculations N
. O

He O
dwelt O
in O
another O
world N
, O
a O
world N
of O
intrigue N
, O
bargains N
, O
contracts N
and O
clandestine O
purchases N
of O
land O
all O
over O
the O
island N
. O

He O
was O
in O
many O
ways N
a O
world N
in O
himself O
, O
whole O
as O
a O
sphere N
. O

No O
doubt N
his O
decisions N
were O
perfectly O
logical O
in O
his O
own O
eyes N
— O
even O
the O
one O
that O
prompted O
him O
, O
a O
patriotic O
islander H
, O
to O
bring O
me H
a O
tutor H
from O
Bain O
: O
Master H
Lunre O
, O
an O
Olondrian O
. O

The O
day N
began O
as O
it O
usually O
did O
when O
my H
father H
was O
expected O
home N
from O
his O
travels N
, O
the O
house N
festooned O
with O
flowers N
and O
stocked O
with O
coconut N
liquor N
. O

We H
stood O
by O
the O
gate N
, O
washed O
and O
perfumed O
and O
arrayed O
in O
our H
brightest O
clothes N
, O
my H
mother H
twisting O
her O
hands N
in O
her O
skirt N
, O
my H
father’s O
father H
’s O
wife H
with O
red O
eyes N
. O

Jom O
, O
grown O
taller O
and O
broad O
in O
the O
shoulders N
, O
moaned O
gently O
to O
himself O
, O
while O
I H
stood O
nervously O
rubbing O
the O
heel N
of O
one O
sandal N
on O
the O
flagstones N
. O

We H
scanned O
the O
deep O
blue O
valley N
for O
the O
first O
sign O
of O
the O
company N
, O
but O
before O
we H
saw O
them O
we H
heard O
the O
children H
shouting O
: O
“ O
A O
yellow O
man H
! O
” O

A O
yellow O
man H
! O

We H
glanced O
at O
one O
another O
in O
confusion N
. O

My H
mother H
bit N
her O
lower O
lip N
; O
Jom O
gave O
a O
groan O
of O
alarm N
. O

At O
first O
I H
thought O
the O
children H
meant O
my H
father H
, O
whose O
golden O
skin N
, O
the O
color N
of O
the O
night O
- O
monkey’s O
monkey A
’s O
pelt N
, O
was O
a O
rarity N
in O
the O
islands N
; O
but O
certainly O
the O
children H
of O
Tyom O
were O
familiar O
with O
my H
father H
, O
and O
would O
never O
have O
greeted O
a O
council N
- O
member H
with O
such O
ill O
- O
mannered O
yells N
. O

Then O
I H
remembered O
the O
only O
“ O
yellow O
man H
” O
I H
had O
ever O
seen O
, O
an O
Olondrian O
wizard H
and O
doctor H
who O
had O
visited O
Tyom O
in O
my H
childhood N
, O
who O
wore O
two O
pieces N
of O
glass N
on O
his O
eyes N
, O
attached O
to O
his O
ears N
with O
wires N
, O
and O
roamed O
the O
hills N
of O
Tinimavet O
, O
cutting O
bits N
off O
the O
trees A
. O

I H
have O
since O
learned O
that O
that O
doctor H
wrote O
a O
well O
- O
received O
treatise N
, O
On O
the O
Medicinal O
Properties N
of O
the O
Juice O
of O
the O
Young O
Coconut O
, O
and O
died O
a O
respected O
man H
in O
his O
native O
city O
of O
Deinivel O
; O
but O
at O
the O
time N
I H
felt O
certain O
he O
had O
returned O
with O
his O
sack N
of O
tree A
- O
cuttings N
. O

“ O
There O
they O
are O
, O
” O
said O
Pavit O
, O
the O
head N
house N
- O
servant H
, O
in O
a O
strained O
voice N
. O

And O
there O
they O
were O
: O
a O
chain N
of O
riders H
weaving O
among O
the O
trees A
. O

My H
father’s O
father H
’s O
plaited O
umbrella N
appeared O
, O
his O
still O
, O
imposing O
figure N
, O
and O
beside O
him O
another O
man H
appeared O
, O
tall O
and O
lean O
, O
astride O
an O
island N
mule A
. O

The O
hectic O
screams N
of O
the O
children H
preceded O
the O
company N
into O
the O
village N
, O
so O
that O
they O
advanced O
like O
a O
festival N
, O
drawing O
people N
out O
of O
their O
houses N
. O

As O
they O
approached O
I H
saw O
that O
my H
father’s O
father H
’s O
face O
was O
shining O
with O
pride N
, O
and O
his O
bearing O
had O
in O
it O
a O
new O
hauteur N
, O
like O
that O
of O
the O
old O
island N
kings H
. O

The O
man H
who O
rode O
beside O
him O
, O
looking O
uncomfortable O
with O
his O
long O
legs N
, O
kept O
his O
gaze N
lowered O
and O
fixed O
between O
the O
ears N
of O
his O
plodding O
mule A
. O

He O
was O
not O
yellow O
, O
but O
very O
pale O
brown O
, O
the O
color N
of O
raw O
cashews A
; O
he O
had O
silver N
hair N
, O
worn O
cropped O
close O
to O
the O
skull N
so O
that O
it O
resembled O
a O
cap N
. O

He O
was O
not O
the O
leaf N
- O
collecting O
doctor H
, O
but O
an O
altogether O
strange O
man H
, O
with O
silver N
eyebrows N
in O
his O
smooth O
face O
and O
long O
fine O
- O
knuckled O
hands N
. O

As O
he O
dismounted O
in O
front N
of O
the O
house N
I H
heard O
my H
mother H
whispering O
: O
“ O
Protect O
us H
, O
God H
with O
the O
Black O
- O
and O
- O
White O
Tail O
, O
from O
that O
which O
is O
not O
of O
this O
earth N
. O
” O

My H
father H
dismounted O
from O
his O
mule A
and O
strutted O
toward O
us H
, O
grinning O
. O

I H
thought O
I H
caught O
an O
odor N
off O
him O
, O
of O
fish A
, O
sea N
- O
sickness N
and O
sweat N
. O

We H
knelt O
and O
stared O
down O
at O
the O
bald O
ground N
, O
murmuring O
ritual N
greetings N
, O
until O
he O
touched O
the O
tops N
of O
our H
heads N
with O
the O
palm N
of O
his O
fleshy O
hand N
. O

Then O
we H
stood O
, O
unable O
to O
keep O
from O
staring O
at O
the O
stranger H
, O
who O
faced O
us H
awkwardly O
, O
half O
- O
smiling O
, O
taller O
than O
any O
man H
there O
. O

Cyclone O
Phailin O
has O
winds N
that O
have O
been O
measured O
at O
200 O
km N
/ O
h N
, O
as O
it O
surges O
over O
land O
will O
it O
begin O
to O
lose O
strength N
? O

Yes O
, O
all O
tropical O
cyclones N
are O
driven O
by O
high O
heat N
content N
waters N
. O

Once O
a O
storm O
moves O
over O
any O
appreciably O
sized O
piece N
of O
land O
, O
the O
moisture N
source N
is O
removed O
and O
the O
storm O
begins O
to O
dissipate O
. O

As O
of O
the O
last O
advisory N
, O
T H
C H
Phailin O
has O
winds N
of O
190 O
kilometers N
per O
hour N
and O
has O
moved O
inland O
, O
headed O
on O
a O
northwest O
track N
. O

That O
is O
a O
Category O
3 O
storm O
. O

The O
forecast N
is O
for O
a O
continued O
decline N
in O
strength N
to O
a O
tropical O
storm O
within O
24 O
hours N
and O
a O
decline N
to O
a O
tropical O
depression N
within O
36 O
hours N
. O

However O
, O
there O
will O
be O
very O
heavy O
rains N
and O
flooding N
along O
its O
path N
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
will O
loose O
strength N
steadily O
as O
more O
and O
more O
of O
this O
swirling O
system N
moves O
from O
being O
over O
ocean N
to O
being O
over O
land O
. O

This O
occurs O
for O
two O
reasons N
: O

As O
it O
moves O
over O
land O
, O
it O
is O
cut O
off O
from O
the O
source N
of O
energy N
driving O
the O
storm O
[ O
which O
is O
] O
the O
evaporation N
of O
water N
from O
the O
warm O
sea N
surface N
; O

Increased O
friction N
- O
the O
ocean N
surface N
is O
much O
, O
much O
smoother O
than O
the O
land O
surface N
. O

Tropical O
cyclones N
are O
sustained O
by O
a O
form N
of O
energy N
called O
latent O
heat N
, O
which O
is O
released O
by O
moisture N
evaporated O
from O
the O
ocean N
that O
condenses O
to O
form N
rain N
. O

As O
tropical O
cyclones N
make O
landfall N
, O
this O
energy N
source N
is O
cut O
- O
off O
and O
they O
rapidly O
lose O
strength N
as O
they O
move O
over O
land O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
Cyclone O
is O
almost O
certain O
to O
lose O
strength N
as O
it O
surges O
over O
land O
. O

Cyclones N
gather O
their O
strength N
through O
scraping O
moisture N
and O
heat N
from O
warm O
ocean N
water N
that O
it O
is O
not O
the O
case N
over O
land O
. O

In O
the O
mean O
time N
, O
much O
stronger O
friction N
over O
land O
quickly O
reduces O
their O
strength N
. O

Yes O
. O

All O
tropical O
cyclones N
lose O
strength N
once O
they O
make O
landfall N
. O

However O
, O
they O
can O
remain O
dangerous O
storms N
due O
to O
very O
heavy O
rains N
and O
subsequent O
landslides N
, O
and O
river N
flooding N
. O

Phailin's O
Phailin O
's H
winds N
will O
rapidly O
weaken O
as O
it O
pushes O
inland O
. O

Once O
Cyclone O
Phailin O
comes O
on O
shore N
it O
will O
immediately O
begin O
to O
lose O
strength N
. O

However O
, O
and O
this O
is O
important O
, O
it O
still O
will O
contain O
lots N
of O
rainfall N
making O
flooding N
an O
almost O
certainty N
. O

A O
previous O
cyclone N
in O
1999 O
in O
the O
Bay O
of O
Bengal O
area N
of O
India O
left O
10,000 O
people N
dead O
. O

Is O
the O
Indian O
government N
well O
prepared O
to O
deal N
with O
this O
cyclone N
? O

I H
have O
not O
followed O
that O
aspect N
of O
the O
societal O
response N
for O
the O
present O
storm O
. O

However O
, O
historically O
, O
there O
have O
been O
several O
events N
that O
should O
cause N
a O
societal O
response N
. O

Hopefully O
, O
we H
all O
learn O
from O
past O
mistakes N
. O

The O
history N
of O
strong O
cyclones N
and O
death N
in O
the O
region N
is O
notable O
, O
with O
at O
least O
5 O
large O
cyclone N
events N
in O
the O
past O
35 O
years N
with O
10,000 O
and O
as O
many O
as O
300,000 O
people N
killed O
, O
millions N
left O
homeless O
and O
estimated O
damages N
as O
high O
as O
US O
$ O
10 O
billion O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
enough O
information N
to O
answer O
this O
question N
, O
one O
way N
or O
the O
other O
. O

From O
all O
the O
press N
reports N
that O
I H
have O
read O
, O
the O
Indian O
government N
appears O
to O
have O
taken O
the O
threat N
of O
Cyclone O
Phailin O
very O
seriously O
indeed O
. O

The O
government N
has O
been O
much O
more O
pro-active O
in O
preparing O
for O
this O
cyclone N
than O
in O
the O
past O
. O

The O
forecasts N
of O
cyclone N
track N
and O
intensity N
have O
been O
fairly O
accurate O
. O

Mandatory O
mass N
evacuations N
have O
been O
carried O
out O
, O
which O
is O
essential O
to O
minimize O
loss N
of O
life N
in O
these O
situations N
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
extensive O
property N
damage N
is O
bound O
to O
occur O
even O
with O
the O
best O
preparation N
. O

My H
knowledge N
of O
the O
responsiveness N
of O
the O
Indian O
government N
to O
this O
storm O
is O
purely O
from O
the O
cyber O
space N
. O

I H
heard O
that O
they O
orchestrated O
the O
largest O
people N
evacuation N
to O
a O
natural O
disaster N
in O
Indian O
history N
. O

This O
shall O
be O
applauded O
given O
the O
size N
and O
strength N
of O
Phailin O
. O

I H
visited O
the O
damaged O
area N
of O
the O
1999 O
storm O
near O
Bhubaneshwar O
in O
the O
summer N
of O
2012 O
for O
an O
invited O
symposium N
and O
summer N
school N
on O
tropical O
cyclones N
[ O
... O
] O
sponsored O
by O
the O
Indian O
government N
. O

Given O
the O
living O
standard N
and O
residence N
of O
people N
living O
near O
the O
coastal O
areas N
in O
this O
region N
, O
the O
evacuation N
is O
certainly O
necessary O
and O
essential O
to O
save O
lives N
. O

I H
cannot O
can O
not O
comment O
directly O
on O
how O
the O
Indian O
government N
was O
prepared O
for O
this O
cyclone N
. O

However O
, O
the O
news N
reports N
( O
BBC O
etc. O
) O
were O
very O
encouraging O
in O
that O
the O
authorities H
were O
reportedly O
making O
strenuous O
efforts N
to O
evacuate O
the O
population N
from O
near O
the O
coast N
and O
areas N
that O
are O
prone O
to O
flooding N
. O

Water N
is O
the O
main O
killer N
in O
these O
storms N
. O

From O
all O
reports N
that O
I H
have O
seen O
, O
the O
government N
was O
well O
prepared O
for O
this O
cyclone N
. O

For O
this O
question N
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
the O
' O
preparedness N
' O
of O
the O
Indian O
gov't N
to O
deal N
with O
this O

) O

Basically O

a O
few O
class N
projects N
, O
and O
I H
came O
up O
with O
a O
few O
class N
projects N
; O

we H
started O
working O
with O
a O
few O
of O
our H
friends H
, O
and O
colleagues H
and O
whatnot N
. O

Those O
included O
Drew H
Cass H
, O
Devin H
Thurlow O
, O
people N
like O
that O
. O

She O
had O
several O
ideas N
, O
and O
she O
used O
to O
draw O
a O
lot N
in O
the O
sketchbook N
, O
she O
used O
to O
have O
this O
thick O
sketchbook N
that O
she O
used O
to O
carry O
around O
with O
her O
everywhere O
, O
where O
she'd O
she O
'd O
draw O
these O
different O
characters A
and O
whatnot N
; O

and O
she O
was O
always O
really O
shy O
to O
show O
that O
off O
to O
people N
, O
and O
I H
wanted O
to O
help O
her O
show O
that O
stuff N
, O
and O
I H
wanted O
to O
bring O
it O
out O
to O
the O
world N
. O

I H
was O
a O
writer O

are O
undergoing O
trial N
for O
manslaughter N
by O
gross O
negligence N
for O
the O
death N
of O
their O
nine O
- O
month N
- O
old O
child H
, O
Gloria H
. O

She O
died O
from O
infection N
caused O
by O
severe O
eczema N
after O
they O
shunned O
effective O
conventional O
medical O
treatments N
for O
homeopathy N
, O
a O
form N
of O
alternative O
medicine N
that O
has O
been O
described O
as O
pseudoscience N
. O

Articles O
in O
peer H
- O
reviewed O
academic O
journals N
including O
Social O
Science O
& O
Medicine O
have O
characterized O
homeopathy N
as O
a O
form N
of O
quackery N
. O

An O
example N
of O
severe O
eczema N
. O

Image N

Jambula O

Gloria H
developed O
severe O
eczema N
at O
the O
age N
of O
four O
months N
and O
the O
parents H
were O
advised O
to O
send O
the O
child H
to O
a O
skin N
specialist H
. O

Thomas H
Sam H
, O
a O
practising O
homeopath H
, O
instead O
decided O
to O
treat O
his O
daughter H
himself O
. O

His O
daughter's O
daughter H
's H
condition N
deteriorated O
, O
to O
the O
point N
that O
the O
baby H
spent O
all O
her O
energy N
battling O
the O
infections N
caused O
by O
the O
constant O
breaking O
of O
the O
skin N
, O
leading O
to O
severe O
malnutrition N
and O
, O
eventually O
, O
her O
death N
. O

By O
the O
end N
, O
Gloria's O
Gloria H
's H
eczema N
was O
so O
severe O
that O
her O
skin N
broke O
every O
time N
her O
parents H
changed O
her O
clothes N
or O
nappy N
, O
and O
in O
the O
words N
of O
the O
Crown O
prosecutor H
, O
Mark H
Tedeschi O
, O
QC O
, O
" O
Gloria H
spent O
a O
lot N
of O
the O
last O
five O
months N
of O
her O
life N
crying O
, O
irritable O
, O
scratching O
and O
the O
only O
thing N
that O
gave O
her O
solace N
was O
to O
suck O
on O
her O
mother's O
mother H
's H
breast N
. O
" O

Gloria H
also O
became O
unable O
to O
move O
her O
legs N
. O

Mr. N
Tedeschi O
also O
told O
the O
court N
that O
, O
over O
the O
last O
five O
months N
of O
her O
life N
, O
" O
Gloria's O
Gloria H
's H
eczema N
played O
a O
devastating O
role N
in O
her O
overall O
health N
and O
it O
is O
asserted O
by O
the O
Crown O
that O
both O
her O
parents H
knew O
this O
and O
discussed O
it O
with O
each O
other O
. O
" O

However O
, O
despite O
their O
child's O
child H
's H
severe O
illness N
, O
and O
her O
lack N
of O
improvement N
, O
the O
Sams O
continued O
to O
shun O
conventional O
medical O
treatment N
, O
instead O
seeking O
help O
from O
other O
homeopaths H
and O
naturopaths H
. O

Gloria H
temporarily O
improved O
during O
the O
rare O
times N
they O
used O
conventional O
treatments N
, O
but O
they O
soon O
dropped O
them O
in O
favour N
of O
homeopathy N
, O
and O
she O
consistently O
worsened O
. O

Allegedly O
, O
Thomas' O
Thomas H
' O
sister H
pleaded O
with O
him O
to O
send O
Gloria H
to O
a O
conventional O
medical O
doctor H
, O
but O
he O
replied O
" O
I H
am O
not O
able O
to O
do O
that O
" O
. O

The O
parents H
are O
also O
accused O
of O
putting O
their O
social O
life N
ahead O
of O
their O
child H
, O
taking O
her O
on O
a O
trip N
to O
India O
and O
leaving O
her O
to O
servants H
while O
embarking O
on O
a O
busy O
social O
schedule N
, O
and O
giving O
her O
homeopathic O
drops N
instead O
of O
using O
the O
prescription N
creams N
they O
had O
been O
given O
. O

Gloria H
was O
finally O
taken O
to O
the O
emergency N
department N
shortly O
before O
her O
death N
. O

By O
this O
time N
, O
" O
her O
skin N
was O
weeping O
, O
her O
body N
malnourished O
and O
her O
corneas N

Speaking O
in O
the O
parents' O
parents H
' O
defense N
, O
Tom H
Molomby O
, O
SC O
, O
said O
that O
, O
as O
the O
parents H
came O
from O
India O
, O
where O
homeopathy N
is O
in O
common O
use N
, O
they O
should O
be O
declared O
not O
guilty O
due O
to O
cultural O
differences N
. O

Homeopathy N
is O
a O
form N
of O
alternative O
medicine N
which O
treats O
patients H
with O
massively O
diluted O
forms O
of O
substances N
that O
, O
if O
given O
to O
a O
healthy O
person H
undiluted O
, O
would O
cause N
symptoms N
similar O
to O
the O
disease N
. O

Typical O
treatments N
take O
the O
dilutions N
, O
with O
ritualised O
shaking O
between O
each O
step N
of O
the O
dilution N
, O
past O
the O
level N
where O
any O
molecules N
of O
the O
original N
substance N
are O
likely O
to O
remain O
; O
for O
homeopathic O
treatments N
to O
work N
, O
basic O
well O
- O
understood O
concepts N
in O
chemistry N
and O
physics N
would O
have O
to O
be O
wrong O

There O
is O
no O
evidence N
that O
homeopathy N
is O
more O
effective O
than O
placebo N
for O
any O
condition N

A O
new O
study N
documenting O
iodine N
nutritional O
status N
in O
Australian O
school N
children H
has O
revealed O
many O
are O
not O
getting O
enough O
iodine N
- O
which O
can O
lead O
to O
mental O
and O
growth N
retardation N
. O

The O
report's O
report N
's H
authors H
say O
iodine N
deficiency N
is O
" O
the O
sleeper H
health N
issue N
in O
Australia O
" O
, O
and O
potentially O
a O
very O
serious O
one O
. O

The O
results N
of O
the O
Australian O
National O
Iodine N
Nutrition O
Study O
published O
in O
the O
Medical O
Journal O
of O
Australia O
this O
week N
, O
revealed O
that O
children H
in O
mainland N
Australia O
are O
borderline O
iodine N
deficient O
. O

The O
report N
has O
prompted O
calls O
for O
all O
edible O
salt O
to O
be O
iodised O
. O

They O
say O
adding O
the O
mineral N
to O
salt O
is O
the O
simplest O
and O
most O
effective O
method N
of O
preventing O
iodine N
deficiency N
disorders N

where O
an O
voluntary O
iodine N
fortification N
program N
using O
iodised O
salt O
in O

, O
is O
ongoing O
. O

The O
authors H
say O
the O
results N
confirm O
the O
existence N
of O
inadequate O
iodine N
intake N
in O
the O
Australian O
population N
. O

They O
call O
for O
" O
urgent O
implementation N
of O
mandatory O
iodisation O
of O
all O
edible O
salt O
in O
Australia O
. O
" O

Most O
iodine N
in O
food N
comes O
from O
seafood N
, O
milk N
and O
iodised O
salt O
. O

Professor H
Cres O
Eastman H
, O
Director O
of O
the O
National O
Iodine N
Nutrition O
study N
, O
and O
Chairman O
of O
the O
Australian O
Centre O
for O
Control N
of O
Iodine N
Deficiency O
Disorders O
, O
says N
it O
is O
crucial O
that O
children H
and O
pregnant O
women H
in O
particular O
have O
an O
adequate O
intake N
of O
iodine N
. O

Iodine N
deficiency N
can O
lead O
to O
serious O
health N
problems N
including O
brain N
damage N
, O
stunted O
growth N
and O
deafness N
. O

Professor H
Eastman H
says N
manufacturers N
could O
easily O
remedy O
the O
situation N
by O
using O
iodised O
salt O
in O
their O
products N
in O
line N
with O
the O
United O
States N
and O
most O
European O
countries N
. O

" O
I H
suspect O
they O
won't O
wo O
n't O
do O
that O
on O
a O
voluntary O
basis N
, O
we've O
we H
've O
tried O
so O
far O
and O
haven't O
have O
n't O
succeeded O
, O
so O
we've O
we H
've O
convinced O
the O
Food N
Standards O
of O
Australia O
and O
New O
Zealand O
| O
that O
all O
salt O
should O
be O
iodised O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

The O
report N
says N
the O
decline N
in O
iodine N
intake N
appears O
to O
be O
due O
to O
changes O
in O
the O
dairy N
industry N
, O
where O
chlorine N
- O
containing O
sanitisers O
have O
replaced O
iodine N
- O
containing O
sanitisers O
. O

Iodine N
released O
from O
these O
chemicals N
into O
milk N
has O
been O
the O
major O
source N
of O
dietary O
iodine N
in O
Australia O
for O
at O
least O
four O
decades N
, O
but O
is O
now O
declining O
. O

Another O
contributory O
factor N
has O
been O
the O
decreasing O
consumption N
of O
iodised O
salt O
used O
in O
foods N
. O

The O
report N
states N
that O
few O
if O
any O
food N
manufacturers N
use N
iodised O
salt O
in O
the O
preparation N
and O
manufacture N
of O
foods N
. O

Professor H
Eastman H
says N
iodine N
is O
added O
to O
only O
10 O
per O
cent O
of O
Australian O
salt O
in O
contravention N
of O
a O
World N
Health O
Organisation O
recommendation N
that O
all O
salt O
be O
iodised O
. O

He O
says N
authorities H
are O
reacting O
slowly O
to O
his O
urgent O
calls O
for O
mandatory O
iodised O
salt O
. O

" O
The O
effects N
of O
iodine N
deficiency N
are O
dependent O
upon O
how O
severe O
it O
is O
and O
when O
it O
occurs O
. O

So O
if O
we H
go O
to O
the O
pregnant O
woman H
, O
she O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
get O
enough O
iodine N
, O
she O
won't O
wo O
n't O
make O
enough O
thyroid N
hormone N
, O
and O
the O
foetus A
won't O
wo O
n't O
get O
the O
amount N
of O
thyroid N
hormone N
it O
needs O
for O
adequate O
and O
proper O
development N
of O
the O
brain N
, O
so O
you'll O
you H
'll O
then O
see O
consequences N
being O
loss N
of O
IQ N
, O
learning N
difficulties N
, O
hearing O
difficulties N
and O
other O
neurological O
problems N
, O
" O
Professor H
Eastman H
said O
. O

" O
If O
an O
infant's O
infant H
's H
not O
getting O
enough O
iodine N
... O
brain N
development N
won't O
wo O
n't O
be O
completed O
and O
they O
won't O
wo O
n't O
grow O
normally O
, O
and O
as O
you H
get O
older O
the O
problem N
will O
be O
that O
you H
will O
develop O
a O
goiter N
and O
your H
thyroid N
won't O
wo O
n't O
function N
as O
well O
as O
it O
should O
, O
so O
that O
may N
have O
all O
sorts O
of O
pernicious O
effects N
upon O
normal O
function N
in O
life N
. O
" O

More O
than O
two O
billion O
people N
around O
the O
world N
live O
in O
areas N
prone O
to O
iodine N
deficiency N
, O
and O
yet O
the O
problem N
is O
easily O
fixed O
. O

The O
World N
Health O
Organisation O
( O
WHO O
) O
recommends O
that O
every O
country N
should O
iodise O
all O
edible O
salt O
. O

The O
most O
well O
known O
effects N
of O
IDD O
are O
visible O
goiter N
and O
cretinism N
, O
a O
condition N
characterised O
by O
severe O
brain N
damage N
occurring O
in O
very O
early O
life N
. O

WHO O
say O
Iodine N
deficiency N
is O
the O
world’s O
world N
’s O
most O
prevalent O
, O
yet O
easily O
preventable O
, O
cause N
of O
brain N
damage N
. O

Professor H
Eastman H
said O
he O
is O
alarmed O
by O
what O
they O
found O
. O

" O
Pregnant O
women H
in O
Australia O
are O
getting O
about O
half O
as O
much O
as O
what O
they O
require O
on O
a O
daily O
basis N
. O

So O
that O
alarms O
me H
, O
because O
there's O
there O
's H
quite O
serious O
potential N
for O
adverse O
effects N
and O
brain N
damage N
in O
the O
next O
generation N
of O
children H
born O
in O
this O
country N
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
If O
Iodine N
deficiency N
is O
serious O
you H
lose O
15 O
IQ N
points N
, O
on O
average O
. O

There O
shouldn't O
should O
n't O
be O
anyone O
suffering O
from O
iodine N
deficiency N
in O
a O
developed O
country N
like O
Australia O
. O
" O

Lydia H
Buchtmann O
for O
Food N
Standards O
Australia O
New O
Zealand O
, O
says N
they O
are O
looking O
at O
mandatory O
guidelines N
on O
iodine N
by O
the O
end N
of O
the O
year N
. O

She O
says N
the O
issue N
is O
complicated O
and O
will O
take O
time N
to O
get O
right O
. O

We H
need O
to O
" O
make O
sure O
there's O
there O
's H
sufficient O
iodine N
added O
into O
the O
food N
supply N
, O
to O
help O
those O
people N
with O
a O
deficiency N
. O

But O
at O
the O
other O
end N
of O
the O
scale N
we've O
we H
've O
got O
to O
make O
sure O
the O
people N
who O
eat O
a O
lot N
of O
food N
- O
we H
all O
know O
the O
teenage O
boy H
who O
comes O
home N
from O
school N
and O
eats O
a O
whole O
loaf N
of O
bread N
- O
that O
those O
people N
don't O
do O
n't O
get O
too O
much O
and O
get O
overdose O
, O
" O
Ms O
Bauchtman O
said O
. O

" O
One O
of O
the O
reasons N
that O
iodine N
is O
going O
down O
is O
because O
people N
are O
taking O
that O
good O
healthy O
eating O
message N
and O
not O
adding O
salt O
during O
cooking N
. O

it O
is O
reasonable O
to O
assume O
that O

Madam H
Speaker O

" O
I H
solemnly O
swear O
that O
in O
all O
things N
appertaining O
to O
the O
trial N
of O
the O
impeachment N
of O
Donald H
John H
Trump H
, O
President H
of O
the O
United O
States N
, O
now O
pending O
, O
I H
will O
do O
impartial O
justice N
according O
to O
the O
Constitution O
and O
laws N
. O
" O

That O
is O
the O
oath N
Senators H
swore O
on O
January O
16 O
. O

It O
is O
the O
oath N
created O
by O
Senators H
when O
they O
tried O
the O
first O
impeachment N
of O
a O
President H
in O
1868 O
. O

It O
is O
an O
oath N
rooted O
in O
the O
Revolution O
fought O
by O
their O
grandparents H
to O
create O
a O
republic N
of O
laws N
, O
not O
kings H
. O

It O
is O
an O
oath N
whose O
power N
derives O
from O
its O
common O
sense N
: O
that O
a O
juror H
must O
always O
be O
impartial O
for O
a O
trial N
to O
be O
fair N
. O

And O
it O
is O
an O
oath N
made O
necessary O
by O
the O
fact N
that O
Senators H
are O
not O
, O
as O
we H
are O
not O
, O
under O
normal O
circumstances N
, O
impartial O
in O
our H
work N
. O

The O
words N
chosen O
for O
this O
oath N
recognize O
that O
when O
our H
Constitution O
calls O
Senators H
to O
try O
impeachment N
, O
it O
calls O
them O
away O
from O
their O
role N
as O
partisans H
. O

When O
that O
oath N
is O
taken O
, O
Senators H
are O
supposed O
to O
step N
back O
from O
the O
affiliation N
of O
party N
or O
political O
kinship N
with O
or O
opposition N
to O
the O
President H
on O
trial N
. O

They O
are O
required O
, O
as O
the O
oath N
plainly O
states N
, O
to O
" O
do O
impartial O
justice N
according O
to O
the O
Constitution O
and O
laws N
. O
" O

Madam H
Speaker O
, O
this O
afternoon N
, O
Senators H
will O
be O
asked O
to O
vote N
on O
the O
two O
Articles O
of O
Impeachment O
the O
House N
presented O
on O
abuse N
of O
power N
and O
the O
obstruction N
of O
Congress O
. O

After O
voting O
to O
refuse O
to O
hear O
evidence N
and O
call O
witnesses H
with O
pertinent O
information N
, O
nearly O
all O
Republican O
Senators H
have O
already O
announced O
that O
they O
will O
vote N
against O
the O
articles N
. O

In O
doing O
so O
, O
many O
of O
them O
acknowledge O
that O
what O
President H
Trump H
did O
was O
wrong O
and O
inappropriate O
. O

They O
accept O
that O
it O
was O
wrong O
for O
him O
to O
withhold O
military O
aid N
to O
Ukraine O
until O
the O
President H
of O
that O
country N
promised O
to O
interfere O
in O
the O
American O
elections N
. O

The O
evidence N
of O
President H
Trump's O
Trump H
's H
abuse N
of O
power N
and O
attempt N
to O
solicit O
foreign O
interference N
in O
the O
2020 O
elections N
is O
clear O
enough O
that O
Republican O
Senators H
cannot O
can O
not O
deny O
and O
have O
not O
denied O
the O
facts N
, O
yet O
they O
cannot O
can O
not O
bring O
themselves O
to O
confront O
this O
President H
and O
are O
choosing O
party N
over O
country N
. O

The O
Senator O
from O
Alaska O
, O
in O
explaining O
her O
decision N
to O
vote N
to O
block O
witnesses H
and O
evidence N
, O
tried O
to O
deflect O
responsibility N
from O
the O
consequences N
of O
her O
actions N
, O
writing N
: O
" O
I H
have O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion N
that O
there O
will O
be O
no O
fair N
trial N
in O
the O
Senate O
. O
" O

I H
agree O
with O
that O
. O

She O
further O
said O
: O
" O
It O
is O
sad O
for O
me H
today N
to O
admit O
that O
, O
as O
an O
institution N
, O
the O
Congress O
has O
failed O
. O
" O

Madam H
Speaker O
, O
the O
Congress O
has O
not O
failed O
. O

The O
House N
did O
its O
job N
, O
whether O
you H
agree O
or O
not O
. O

In O
regular O
order N
, O
by O
a O
vote N
of O
this O
House N
, O
we H
impeached O
the O
President H
of O
the O
United O
States N
based O
upon O
our H
oath N
to O
protect O
and O
defend O
the O
Constitution O
of O
the O
United O
States N
. O

The O
House N
did O
its O
job N
and O
did O
so O
with O
the O
solemnity N
required O
when O
undertaking O
the O
process N
of O
impeachment N
, O
which O
we H
did O
not O
seek O
but O
accepted O
as O
our H
responsibility N
under O
the O
Constitution O
. O

We H
held O
hearings N
, O
called O
witnesses H
, O
and O
subpoenaed O
documents N
. O

Many O
of O
the O
witnesses H
and O
documents N
, O
of O
course O
, O
were O
withheld O
by O
the O
White O
House N
. O

It O
is O
the O
Senate O
that O
will O
fail O
if O
Senators H
do O
not O
uphold O
their O
oaths N
to O
impartial O
justice N
. O

It O
is O
the O
Senate O
, O
Madam H
Speaker O
, O
that O
will O
fail O
if O
it O
does O
not O
hold N
this O
President H
accountable O
for O
using O
a O
hold N
on O
military O
aid N
to O
compel O
an O
ally N
to O
interfere O
in O
our H
election N
for O
his O
own O
personal O
gain O
. O

History N
will O
judge H
poorly O
those O
who O
choose O
fear N
of O
their O
party N
over O
the O
courage N
to O
do O
the O
right O
thing N
. O

Neither O
the O
Speaker O
nor O
myself H
, O
nor O
the O
whip N
, O
Jim H
Clyburn O
, O
urged O
any O
member H
in O
our H
party N
to O
vote N
any O
way N
on O
impeachment N
. O

There O
was O
no O
lobbying O
. O

There O
was O
no O
pressure N
. O

Our H
members H
voted O
consistent O
with O
their O
oath N
of O
office N
and O
the O
conviction N
that O
that O
vote N
was O
required O
by O
that O
oath N
to O
protect O
and O
defend O
the O
Constitution O
. O

Americans H
will O
judge H
. O

I H
am O
often O
asked O
why O
the O
House N
passed O
Articles O
of O
Impeachment O
even O
knowing O
that O
the O
odds O
were O
slim O
that O
Senate O
Republicans O
would O
set O
aside O
partisanship N
and O
hear O
the O
case N
as O
impartial O
jurors H
. O

It O
is O
because O
I H
know O
future N
generations N
will O
look O
back O
on O
this O
chapter N
in O
our H
history N
and O
ask O
: O

Who O
stood O
up O
for O
the O
Constitution O
and O
the O
laws N
? O

Who O
stood O
up O
for O
the O
values N
our H
Founders O
charged O
us H
to O
keep O
? O

Who O
refused O
to O
shrink O
from O
the O
heavy O
responsibilities N
of O
their O
oath N
? O

I H
can O
be O
proud O
that O
the O
House N
did O
its O
job N
, O
followed O
the O
law N
, O
defended O
our H
Constitution O
. O

We H
did O
not O
convict O
; O
that O
is O
not O
our H
role N
. O

Essentially O
, O
what O
we H
said O
was O
there O
was O
probable O
cause N
that O
powers N
had O
been O
abused O
and O
certainly O
cause N
to O
see O
that O
the O
President H
refused O
to O
cooperate O
with O
the O
constitutional O
responsibilities N
of O
the O
House N
of O
Representatives O
. O

I H
am O
also O
proud O
of O
the O
House N
managers H
, O
as O
all O
of O
my H
colleagues H
on O
the O
Democratic O
side N
of O
the O
aisle N
are O
proud O
of O
our H
managers H
who O
made O
their O
case N
. O

They O
made O
their O
case N
with O
intellect N
. O

They O
made O
their O
case N
with O
evidence N
that O
had O
been O
adduced O
here O
in O
the O
House N
. O

They O
made O
their O
case N
and O
appealed O
to O
Senators H
to O
hold N
this O
President H
accountable O
, O
as O
our H
Founders O
intended O
. O

Almost O
everybody O
has O
watched O
a O
trial N
either O
in O
person H
or O
on O
television N
. O

A O
trial N
is O
not O
an O
opening O
argument N
and O
a O
closing O
argument N
with O
nothing O
in O
between O
. O

Seventy O
- O
five O
percent N
of O
our H
people N
wanted O
to O
have O
witnesses H
because O
that O
was O
their O
understanding N
of O
what O
a O
trial N
is O
, O
not O
just O
argument N
at O
the O
beginning H
and O
argument N
at O
the O
end N
, O
but O
evidence N
for O
jurors H
who O
have O
pledged O
to O
be O
impartial O
to O
consider O
. O

Any O
judge H
in O
this O
country N
would O
agree O
that O
opening O
and O
closing O
statements N
alone O
are O
not O
a O
trial N
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
House N
managers H
proved O
their O
case N
. O

The O
truth N
is O
clear O
. O

The O
American O
people N
know O
what O
that O
truth N
is O
and O
know O
what O
this O
President H
has O
done O
. O

And O
they O
will O
remember O
who O
on O
this O
day N
abided O
by O
the O
truth N
, O
the O
whole O
truth N
, O
and O
nothing O
but O
the O
truth N

and O
my H
fellow H
citizens H
: O

To O
a O
few O
of O
us H
here O
today N
this O
is O
a O
solemn O
and O
most O
momentous O
occasion N
, O
and O
yet O
in O
the O
history N
of O
our H
nation N
it O
is O
a O
commonplace O
occurrence N
. O

The O
orderly O
transfer N
of O
authority N
as O
called O
for O
in O
the O
Constitution O
routinely O
takes O
place N
, O
as O
it O
has O
for O
almost O
two O
centuries N
, O
and O
few O
of O
us H
stop N
to O
think O
how O
unique O
we H
really O
are O
. O

In O
the O
eyes N
of O
many O
in O
the O
world N
, O
this O
every O
4 O
- O
year N
ceremony N
we H
accept O
as O
normal O
is O
nothing O
less O
than O
a O
miracle N
. O

Mr. N
President H
, O
I H
want O
our H
fellow H
citizens H
to O
know O
how O
much O
you H
did O
to O
carry O
on O
this O
tradition N
. O

By O
your H
gracious O
cooperation N
in O
the O
transition N
process N
, O
you H
have O
shown O
a O
watching O
world N
that O
we H
are O
a O
united O
people N
pledged O
to O
maintaining O
a O
political O
system N
which O
guarantees O
individual O
liberty N
to O
a O
greater O
degree N
than O
any O
other O
, O
and O
I H
thank O
you H
and O
your H
people N
for O
all O
your H
help O
in O
maintaining O
the O
continuity N
which O
is O
the O
bulwark N
of O
our H
Republic N
. O

The O
business N
of O
our H
nation N
goes O
forward O
. O

These O
United O
States N
are O
confronted O
with O
an O
economic O
affliction N
of O
great O
proportions N
. O

We H
suffer O
from O
the O
longest O
and O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
sustained O
inflations N
in O
our H
national O
history N
. O

It O
distorts O
our H
economic O
decisions N
, O
penalizes O
thrift N
, O
and O
crushes O
the O
struggling O
young O
and O
the O
fixed O
- O
income N
elderly N
alike O
. O

It O
threatens O
to O
shatter O
the O
lives N
of O
millions N
of O
our H
people N
. O

Idle O
industries N
have O
cast O
workers H
into O
unemployment N
, O
human O
misery N
, O
and O
personal O
indignity N
. O

Those O
who O
do O
work N
are O
denied O
a O
fair N
return N
for O
their O
labor N
by O
a O
tax N
system N
which O
penalizes O
successful O
achievement N
and O
keeps O
us H
from O
maintaining O
full O
productivity N
. O

But O
great O
as O
our H
tax N
burden N
is O
, O
it O
has O
not O
kept O
pace N
with O
public O
spending N
. O

For O
decades N
we H
have O
piled O
deficit N
upon O
deficit N
, O
mortgaging O
our H
future N
and O
our H
children's O
children H
's H
future N
for O
the O
temporary O
convenience N
of O
the O
present O
. O

To O
continue O
this O
long O
trend N
is O
to O
guarantee N
tremendous O
social O
, O
cultural O
, O
political O
, O
and O
economic O
upheavals N
. O

You H
and O
I H
, O
as O
individuals H
, O
can O
, O
by O
borrowing O
, O
live O
beyond O
our H
means O
, O
but O
for O
only O
a O
limited O
period N
of O
time N
. O

Why O
, O
then O
, O
should O
we H
think O
that O
collectively O
, O
as O
a O
nation N
, O
we're O
we H
're O
not O
bound O
by O
that O
same O
limitation N
? O

We H
must O
act N
today N
in O
order N
to O
preserve O
tomorrow N
. O

And O
let O
there O
be O
no O
misunderstanding N
: O
We H
are O
going O
to O
begin O
to O
act N
, O
beginning H
today N
. O

The O
economic O
ills N
we H
suffer O
have O
come O
upon O
us H
over O
several O
decades N
. O

They O
will O
not O
go O
away O
in O
days N
, O
weeks N
, O
or O
months N
, O
but O
they O
will O
go O
away O
. O

They O
will O
go O
away O
because O
we H
as O
Americans H
have O
the O
capacity N
now O
, O
as O
we've O
we H
've O
had O
in O
the O
past O
, O
to O
do O
whatever O
needs O
to O
be O
done O
to O
preserve O
this O
last O
and O
greatest O
bastion N
of O
freedom N
. O

In O
this O
present O
crisis N
, O
government N
is O
not O
the O
solution N
to O
our H
problem N
; O
government N
is O
the O
problem N
. O

From O
time N
to O
time N
we've O
we H
've O
been O
tempted O
to O
believe O
that O
society N
has O
become O
too O
complex O
to O
be O
managed O
by O
self N
- O
rule N
, O
that O
government N
by O
an O
elite O
group N
is O
superior O
to O
government N
for O
, O
by O
, O
and O
of O
the O
people N
. O

Well O
, O
if O
no O
one O
among O
us H
is O
capable O
of O
governing O
himself O
, O
then O
who O
among O
us H
has O
the O
capacity N
to O
govern O
someone O
else O
? O

All O
of O
us H
together O
, O
in O
and O
out O
of O
government N
, O
must O
bear O
the O
burden N
. O

The O
solutions N
we H
seek O
must O
be O
equitable O
, O
with O
no O
one O
group N
singled O
out O
to O
pay O
a O
higher O
price N
. O

We H
hear O
much O
of O
special O
interest N
groups N
. O

Well O
, O
our H
concern N
must O
be O
for O
a O
special O
interest N
group N
that O
has O
been O
too O
long O
neglected O
. O

It O
knows O
no O
sectional O
boundaries N
or O
ethnic O
and O
racial O
divisions N
, O
and O
it O
crosses O
political O
party N
lines N
. O

It O
is O
made O
up O
of O
men H
and O
women H
who O
raise O
our H
food N
, O
patrol O
our H
streets N
, O
man H
our H
mines N
and O
factories N
, O
teach O
our H
children H
, O
keep O
our H
homes N
, O
and O
heal O
us H
when O
we're O
we H
're O
sick O
— O
professionals H
, O
industrialists H
, O
shopkeepers H
, O
clerks H
, O
cabbies H
, O
and O
truck N
drivers H
. O

They O
are O
, O
in O
short O
, O
" O
We H
the O
people N
, O
" O
this O
breed A
called O
Americans H
. O

Well O
, O
this O
administration's O
administration N
's H
objective N
will O
be O
a O
healthy O
, O
vigorous O
, O
growing O
economy N
that O
provides O
equal O
opportunities N
for O
all O
Americans H
, O
with O
no O
barriers N
born O
of O
bigotry N
or O
discrimination N
. O

Putting O
America O
back O
to O
work N
means O
putting O
all O
Americans H
back O
to O
work N
. O

Ending O
inflation N
means O
freeing O
all O
Americans H
from O
the O
terror H
of O
runaway O
living O
costs N
. O

All O
must O
share O
in O
the O
productive O
work N
of O
this O

, O
" O
and O
all O
must O
share O
in O
the O
bounty N
of O
a O
revived O
economy N

With O
the O
idealism N
and O
fair N
play O
which O
are O
the O
core O
of O
our H
system N
and O
our H
strength N

we H

1.1 O
What O
is O
Government N
? O

DIFFERENT O
TYPES N
OF O
GOVERNMENT N

The O
government N
of O
the O
United O
States N
can O
best O
be O
described O
as O
a O
republic N
, O
or O
representative O
democracy N
. O

A O
democracy N
is O
a O
government N
in O
which O
political O
power N
— O
influence N
over O
institutions N
, O
leaders H
, O
and O
policies N
— O
rests O
in O
the O
hands N
of O
the O
people N
. O

In O
a O
representative O
democracy N
, O
however O
, O
the O
citizens H
do O
not O
govern O
directly O
. O

Instead O
, O
they O
elect O
representatives H
to O
make O
decisions N
and O
pass O
laws N
on O
behalf N
of O
all O
the O
people N
. O

Thus O
, O
U.S. O
citizens H
vote N
for O
members H
of O
Congress O
, O
the O
president H
and O
vice O
president H
, O
members H
of O
state N
legislatures N
, O
governors H
, O
mayors H
, O
and O
members H
of O
town N
councils N
and O
school N
boards N
to O
act N
on O
their O
behalf N
. O

Most O
representative O
governments N
favor O
majority N
rule N
: O

the O
opinions N
of O
the O
majority N
of O
the O
people N
have O
more O
influence N
with O
government N
than O
those O
of O
the O
minority N
. O

If O
the O
number N
of O
elected O
representatives H
who O
favor O
a O
proposed O
law N
is O
greater O
than O
those O
who O
oppose O
it O
, O
the O
law N
will O
be O
enacted O
. O

However O
, O
in O
representative O
governments N
like O
the O
United O
States N
, O
minority N
rights N
are O
protected O
: O
people N
cannot O
can O
not O
be O
deprived O
of O
certain O
rights N
even O
if O
an O
overwhelming O
number N
of O
people N
think O
that O
they O
should O
be O
. O

For O
example N
, O
let’s O
let O
’s H
say O
American O
society N
decided O
that O
atheists H
, O
people N
who O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
God H
exists O
, O
were O
evil N
and O
should O
be O
imprisoned O
or O
expelled O
from O
the O
country N
. O

Even O
though O
atheists H
only O
account N
for O
about O
7 O
percent N
of O
the O
population N
, O
they O
would O
be O
protected O
due O
to O
minority N
rights N
. O
4 O

Even O
though O
the O
number N
of O
Americans H
who O
believe O
in O
God H
far O
outweighs O
the O
number N
who O
do O
not O
, O
the O
minority N
is O
still O
protected O
. O

Because O
decisions N
are O
made O
through O
majority N
rule N
, O
making O
your H
opinions N
known O
and O
voting O
for O
those O
men H
and O
women H
who O
make O
decisions N
that O
affect O
all O
of O
us H
are O
critical O
and O
influential O
forms O
of O
civic O
engagement N
in O
a O
representative O
democracy N
such O
as O
the O
United O
States N
. O

In O
a O
direct O
democracy N
, O
unlike O
representative O
democracy N
, O
people N
participate O
directly O
in O
making O
government N
decisions N
. O

For O
example N
, O
in O
ancient O
Athens O
, O
the O
most O
famous O
example N
of O
a O
direct O
democracy N
, O
all O
male H
citizens H
were O
allowed O
to O
attend O
meetings N
of O
the O
Assembly O
. O

Here O
they O
debated O
and O
voted O
for O
or O
against O
all O
proposed O
laws N
. O

Although O
neither O
the O
federal O
government N
nor O
any O
of O
the O
state N
governments N
function N
as O
a O
direct O
democracy N
— O
the O
Constitution O
requires O
the O
national O
and O
state N
governments N
to O
be O
representative O
forms O
of O
government N
— O
some O
elements N
of O
direct O
democracy N
do O
exist O
in O
the O
United O
States N
. O

While O
residents H
of O
the O
different O
states N
vote N
for O
people N
to O
represent O
them O
and O
to O
make O
laws N
in O
their O
behalf N
in O
the O
state N
legislatures N
and O
in O
Congress O
, O
people N
may N
still O
directly O
vote N
on O
certain O
issues N
. O

For O
example N
, O
a O
referendum N
or O
proposed O
law N
might O
be O
placed O
on O
the O
ballot N
for O
citizens H
to O
vote N
on O
directly O
during O
state N
or O
local O
elections N
instead O
of O
leaving O
the O
matter N
in O
the O
hands N
of O
the O
state N
legislature N
. O

At O
New O
England O
town N
meetings N
, O
all O
residents H
are O
allowed O
to O
debate N
decisions N
affecting O
the O
town N
( O
Figure O
1.5 O
) O
. O

Such O
occasions N
provide O
additional O
opportunities N
for O
civic O
engagement N
. O

. O

New O
England O
town N
meetings N
provide O
an O
opportunity N
for O
people N
to O
experience O
direct O
democracy N
. O

This O
tradition N
has O
lasted O
for O
hundreds N
of O
years N
. O

( O

Most O
countries N
now O
have O
some O
form N
of O
representative O
government N
( O

. O
5 O

At O
the O
other O
end N
of O
the O
political O
spectrum N
are O
elite O
- O
driven O
forms O
of O
government N
. O

In O
a O
monarchy N
, O
one O
ruler H
, O
usually O
a O
hereditary O
ruler H
, O
holds O
political O
power N
. O

Although O
the O
power N
of O
some O
monarchs H
is O
limited O
by O
law N
, O
and O
such O
kings H
and O
queens H
often O
rule N
along O
with O
an O
elected O
legislature N
that O
makes O
laws N
for O
the O
country N
, O
this O
is O
not O
always O
the O
case N
. O

Many O
southwest N
Asian O
kingdoms N
, O
such O
as O
Saudi O
Arabia O
, O
Qatar O
, O
and O
the O
United O
Arab H
Emirates O
, O
have O
absolute O
monarchs H
whose O
power N
is O
unrestricted O
. O

As O
discussed O
earlier O
, O
another O
nondemocratic O
form N
of O
government N
is O
oligarchy N
, O
in O
which O
a O
handful N
of O
elite O
members H
of O
society N
, O
often O
those O
who O
belong O
to O
a O
particular O
political O
party N
, O
hold N
all O
political O
power N
. O

For O
example N
, O
in O
Cuba O
, O
as O
in O
China O
, O
only O
members H
of O
the O
Communist O
Party N
are O
allowed O
to O
vote N
or O
hold N
public O
office N
, O
and O
the O
party’s O
party N
’s H
most O
important O
members H
make O
all O
government N
decisions N
. O

Some O
nondemocratic O
societies N
are O
totalitarian O
in O
nature N
. O

Under O
totalitarianism N
, O
the O
government N
is O
more O
important O
than O
the O
citizens H
, O
and O
it O
controls N
all O
aspects N
of O
citizens’ O
citizens H
’ O
lives N
. O

Citizens’ O
Citizens H
’ O
rights N
are O
limited O
, O
and O
the O
government N
does O
not O
allow O
political O
criticism N
or O
opposition N
. O

These O
forms O
of O
government N
are O
fairly O
rare O
. O

North O
Korea O
is O
an O
example N
of O
a O
totalitarian O
government N
. O

that O

much O
political O
power N
as O
they O
do O
in O
the O

Countries N
that O

, O
like O
China O
, O
Vietnam O
, O
and O
Cuba O
, O
have O
an O
oligarchic O
form N
of O

Countries N

a O
good O
or O
service N
, O
workers H
and O
businesses N
can O
produce N
a O
greater O
quantity N
of O
output N
. O

In O
his O
observations N
of O
pin N
factories N
, O
Smith H
noticed O
that O
one O
worker H
alone O
might O
make O
20 O
pins N
in O
a O
day N
, O
but O
that O
a O
small O
business N
of O
10 O
workers H
( O
some O
of O
whom O
would O
need O
to O
complete O
two O
or O
three O
of O
the O
18 O
tasks N
involved O
with O
pin N
- O
making O
) O
, O
could O
make O
48,000 O
pins N
in O
a O
day N
. O

How O
can O
a O
group N
of O
workers H
, O
each O
specializing O
in O
certain O
tasks N
, O
produce N
so O
much O
more O
than O
the O
same O
number N
of O
workers H
who O
try O
to O
produce N
the O
entire O
good O
or O
service N
by O
themselves O
? O

Smith H
offered O
three O
reasons N
. O

First O
, O
specialization N
in O
a O
particular O
small O
job N
allows O
workers H
to O
focus O
on O
the O
parts N
of O
the O
production N
process N
where O
they O
have O
an O
advantage N
. O

( O
In O
later O
chapters N
, O
we H
will O
develop O
this O
idea N
by O
discussing O
comparative O
advantage N
. O
) O

People N
have O
different O
skills N
, O
talents N
, O
and O
interests N
, O
so O
they O
will O
be O
better O
at O
some O
jobs N
than O
at O
others O
. O

The O
particular O
advantages N
may N
be O
based O
on O
educational O
choices N
, O
which O
are O
in O
turn O
shaped O
by O
interests N
and O
talents N
. O

Only O
those O
with O
medical O
degrees N
qualify O
to O
become O
doctors H
, O
for O
instance N
. O

For O
some O
goods N
, O
geography N
affects O
specialization N
. O

For O
example N
, O
it O
is O
easier O
to O
be O
a O
wheat A
farmer H
in O
North O
Dakota O
than O
in O
Florida O
, O
but O
easier O
to O
run O
a O
tourist H
hotel N
in O
Florida O
than O
in O
North O
Dakota O
. O

If O
you H
live O
in O
or O
near O
a O
big O
city O
, O
it O
is O
easier O
to O
attract O
enough O
customers H
to O
operate O
a O
successful O
dry O
cleaning N
business N
or O
movie N
theater N
than O
if O
you H
live O
in O
a O
sparsely O
populated O
rural O
area N
. O

Whatever O
the O
reason N
, O
if O
people N
specialize O
in O
the O
production N
of O
what O
they O
do O
best O
, O
they O
will O
be O
more O
effective O
than O
if O
they O
produce N
a O
combination N
of O
things N
, O
some O
of O
which O
they O
are O
good O
at O
and O
some O
of O
which O
they O
are O
not O
good O
at O
. O

Second O
, O
workers H
who O
specialize O
in O
certain O
tasks N
often O
learn O
to O
produce N
more O
quickly O
and O
with O
higher O
quality N
. O

This O
pattern N
holds O
true O
for O
many O
workers H
, O
including O
assembly N
line N
laborers H
who O
build O
cars N
, O
stylists H
who O
cut O
hair N
, O
and O
doctors H
who O
perform O
heart N
surgery N
. O

In O
fact N
, O
specialized O
workers H
often O
know O
their O
jobs N
well O
enough O
to O
suggest O
innovative O
ways N
to O
do O
their O
work N
faster O
and O
better O
. O

A O
similar O
pattern N
often O
operates O
within O
businesses N
. O

In O
many O
cases N
, O
a O
business N
that O
focuses O
on O
one O
product O
or O
a O
few O
products N
( O
sometimes O
called O
its O
“ O
core O
competency N
” O
) O
is O
more O
successful O
than O
firms N
that O
try O
to O
make O
a O
wide O
range N
of O
products N
. O

Third O
, O
specialization N
allows O
businesses N
to O
take O
advantage N
of O
economies N
of O
scale N
, O
which O
means O
that O
for O
many O
goods N
, O
as O
the O
level N
of O
production N
increases N
, O
the O
average O
cost N
of O
producing O
each O
individual O
unit N
declines O
. O

For O
example N
, O
if O
a O
factory N
produces O
only O
100 O
cars N
per O
year N
, O
each O
car N
will O
be O
quite O
expensive O
to O
make O
on O
average O
. O

However O
, O
if O
a O
factory N
produces O
50,000 O
cars N
each O
year N
, O
then O
it O
can O
set O
up O
an O
assembly N
line N
with O
huge O
machines N
and O
workers H
performing O
specialized O
tasks N
, O
and O
the O
average O
cost N
of O
production N
per O
car N
will O
be O
lower O
. O

The O
ultimate O
result N
of O
workers H
who O
can O
focus O
on O
their O
preferences N
and O
talents N
, O
learn O
to O
do O
their O
specialized O
jobs N
better O
, O
and O
work N
in O
larger O
organizations N
is O
that O
society N
as O
a O
whole O
can O
produce N
and O
consume O
far O
more O
than O
if O
each O
person H
tried O
to O
produce N
all O
of O
his O
or O
her O
own O
goods N
and O
services N
. O

The O
division N
and O
specialization N
of O
labor N
has O
been O
a O
force O
against O
the O
problem N
of O
scarcity N
. O

Hi O
everyone O
, O
welcome O
back O
to O
my H
channel N
. O

My H
name N
is O
Katie H
and O
today N
I'm O
I H
'm O
going O
to O
be O
talking O
about O
my H
two O
and O
a O
half O
week N
long O
vacation N
to O
Portland O
, O
Oregon O
. O

So O
I H
am O
from O
Washington O
D.C. O
, O
and O
I H
have O
a O
bunch N
of O
family N
in O
Portland O
, O
Oregon O
, O
so O
it O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
my H
first O
time N
going O
there O
. O

Um O
but O
it O
was O
definitely O
my H
first O
time N
, O
like O
as O
an O
adult H
. O

So O
that O
was O
really O
exciting O
and O
fun N
. O

I H
thought O
that O
I H
would O
make O
sort N
of O
like O
more O
of O
an O
informative O
video N
because O
I H
could O
just O
like O
post N
a O
vlog O
, O
but O
um O
the O
footage N
was O
like O
so O
random O
, O
and O
all O
over O
the O
place N
. O

I H
got O
some O
really O
cool O
footage N
but O
um O
, O
not O
like O
cute O
like O
Instagram O
girl H
footage N
, O
because O
I H
did O
dress N
like O
a O
12 O
year N
old O
boy H
the O
whole O
time N
. O

So O
the O
first O
thing N
that O
I H
recommend O
you H
do O
in O
Portland O
is O
not O
actually O
in O
Portland O
at O
all O
. O

So O
you H
might O
be O
like O
this O
is O
a O
terrible O
list O
. O

Sorry O
. O

The O
number N
one O
thing N
that O
we H
did O
on O
our H
trip N
was O
we H
actually O
stayed O
a O
night O
in O
Eugene O
, O
Oregon O
, O
and O
we H
got O
up O
at O
like O
the O
crack N
of O
dawn N
and O
drove O
to O
Crater O
Lake O
. O

This O
was O
incredible O
. O

Um O
one O
of O
the O
coolest O
things N
that O
I H
have O
ever O
seen O
. O

The O
footage N
that O
I'm O
I H
'm O
gonna O
gon O
na O
put O
in O
here O
honestly O
it O
looks O
a O
little O
bit N
fake O
. O

This O
place N
was O
incredible O
. O

We H
didn't O
did O
n't O
do O
a O
whole O
lot N
of O
hiking O
here O
because O
there O
was O
not O
a O
whole O
lot N
of O
cloud N
coverage N
that O
day N
, O
and O
it O
was O
so O
hot O
. O

So O
what O
we H
did O
was O
we H
drove O
around O
the O
entire O
perimeter N
of O
the O
lake O
and O
you H
get O
all O
these O
incredible O
views N
of O
the O
mountains N
and O
the O
lake O
, O
and O
seeing O
it O
from O
all O
the O
different O
angles N
was O
so O
worth O
it O
. O

So O
maybe O
this O
is O
not O
something O
that O
you H
want O
to O
do O
if O
you're O
you H
're O
just O
going O
to O
Portland O
for O
a O
couple N
of O
days N
but O
it's O
it O
's H
definitely O
something O
to O
consider O
if O
you're O
you H
're O
going O
out O
to O
Oregon O
for O
a O
little O
bit N
longer O
period N
of O
time N
. O

Number N
two O
is O
shopping N
. O

These O
are O
in O
no O
particular O
order N
by O
the O
way N
. O

They're O
They O
're O
just O
sort N
of O
like O
what O
I H
thought O
of O
as O
I H
was O
making O
this O
video N
. O

So O
there's O
there O
's H
a O
lot N
of O
cool O
shopping N
in O
Portland O
, O
Oregon O
. O

A O
lot N
of O
cool O
thrifting O
and O
vintage N
stores N
, O
a O
lot N
of O
cool O
art N
galleries N
. O

And O
then O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
things N
that O
you H
should O
check O
out O
while O
you're O
you H
're O
there O
is O
Powell's O
Powell O
's H
which O
is O
a O
bookstore N
. O

And O
I H
want O
to O
say O
it's O
it O
's H
like O
the O
the O
biggest O
like O
Indie O
Indie O
bookstore N
in O
America O
. O

I H
guess O
that's O
that O
's H
what O
it's O
it O
's H
called O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
gonna O
gon O
na O
– O
oh O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
the O
world's O
world N
's H
largest O
independent O
bookstore N
. O

So O
this O
place N
was O
so O
cool O
we H
could O
have O
spent O
hours N
in O
here O
. O

The O
best O
thing N
that O
I H
thought O
about O
this O
bookstore N
was O
that O
they O
mixed O
in O
new O
copies N
of O
books N
with O
used O
copies N
. O

So O
if O
you're O
you H
're O
looking O
for O
a O
book O
and O
you're O
you H
're O
wondering O
like O
– O
oh O
I H
wonder O
if O
I H
could O
get O
this O
used O
, O
like O
it's O
it O
's H
usually O
right O
next O
to O
it O
, O
which O
I H
thought O
was O
just O
like O
so O
awesome O
. O

That O
was O
very O
exciting O
for O
me H
because O
I H
love O
a O
used O
book O
. O

So O
I H
am O
not O
a O
huge O
like O
nature N
person H
. O

Um O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
enjoy O
bugs A
. O

But O
um O
I H
will O
go O
on O
a O
good O
hike N
from O
now O
and O
again O
so O
just O
like O
you H
know O
where O
I'm O
I H
'm O
coming O
from O
. O

My H
friend H
Andrea H
is O
a O
biology N
major O
so O
we H
did O
stop N
to O
look O
at O
many O
slugs N
that O
were O
on O
the O
ground N
and O
I H
did O
beeline O
it O
away O
from O
the O
slugs N
. O

But O
if O
you H
like O
slugs N
, O
you're O
you H
're O
in O
– O
you're O
you H
're O
in O
luck N
. O

So O
the O
first O
couple N
days N
we H
were O
in O
Portland O
, O
we H
went O
hiking O
in O
Forest O
Park O
which O
you H
can O
get O
to O
by O
public O
transit N
in O
the O
city O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
really O
quick O
and O
some O
of O
the O
trails N
even O
pop O
you H
back O
out O
into O
like O
the O
city O
, O
so O
it's O
it O
's H
– O
it's O
it O
's H
really O
super O
accessible O
. O

So O
we H
did O
the O
Wildwood O
Trail O
and O
we H
also O
did O
a O
tour N
of O
Pittock O
Mansion O
. O

Um O
if O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
do O
a O
tour N
of O
Pittock O
Mansion O
, O
I'd O
I H
'd O
still O
recommend O
like O
taking O
the O
trail N
up O
there O
because O
it O
has O
a O
really O
cool O
like O
overlook N
of O
the O
city O
that O
you H
can O
go O
see O
. O

Um O
I H
loved O
doing O
that O
. O

So O
number N
four O
are O
the O
Japanese O
gardens N
and O
the O
rose O
gardens N
in O
Forest O
Park O
. O

I H
actually O
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
they're O
they O
're O
like O
technically O
in O
Forest O
Park O
but O
they're O
they O
're O
right O
in O
the O
same O
area N
. O

So O
the O
rose O
garden N
is O
free O
and O
open O
to O
the O
public O
and O
it O
is O
just O
huge O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
a O
lot N
of O
roses A
as O
you H
can O
imagine O
. O

Um O
lots N
of O
tourists H
but O
it O
was O
– O
it O
was O
still O
really O
fun N
. O

You H
get O
to O
walk O
through O
all O
these O
gardens N
and O
different O
types N
of O
roses A
from O
different O
parts N
of O
the O
world N
and O
yeah O
it O
was O
just O
really O
cool O
. O

Then O
the O
Japanese O
gardens N
you H
do O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
but O
I H
will O
say O
that O
it O
was O
definitely O
worth O
it O
. O

If O
it's O
it O
's H
a O
clear O
day N
you H
can O
actually O
see O
Mount O
Hood O
from O
the O
Japanese O
gardens N
which O
was O
really O
wild O
, O
and O
the O
garden N
was O
just O
so O
pretty O
and O
quiet O
and O
serene O
. O

There O
were O
even O
some O
people N
like O
meditating O
in O
there O
which O
was O
kind N
of O
funny O
. O

I H
did O
wear O
my H
bird A
shirt N
– O
It's O
It O
's H
a O
pretty O
good O
bird A
shirt N
, O
I H
got O
a O
compliment N
on O
it O
– O
which O
I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
say O
this O
earlier O
, O
but O
I H
bought O
this O
at O
the O
Audubon O
Society O
which O
I H
learned O
what O
that O
was O
. O

I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
know O
what O
that O
was O
but O
it's O
it O
's H
um O
a O
society N
for O
um O
like O
bird A
watching O
and O
bird A
care O
and O
um O
they O
had O
a O
shirt N
that O
said O
bird A
nerd H
on O
it O
so O
I H
bought O
it O
because O
I H
thought O
it O
was O
funny O
. O

But O
I H
was O
approached O
by O
– O
I H
want O
to O
say O
– O
at O
least O
three O
different O
people N
who O
asked O
me H
if O
I H
did O
bird A
watching O
like O
very O
seriously O
. O

What's O
What O
's H
up O
YouTube O
? O

So O
we H
are O
going O
to O
do O
a O
week N
of O
me H
vlogging O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
kind N
of O
an O
interesting O
week N
. O

I H
bounced O
around O
here O
and O
there O
, O
so O
I H
have O
to O
kind N
of O
show O
you H
guys H
around O
and O
show O
you H
what O
it's O
it O
's H
all O
about O
, O
and O
today N
I'm O
I H
'm O
on O
general O
nuclear O
medicine N
, O
so O
let's O
let O
's H
start N
the O
day N
. O

So O
like O
I H
said O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
on O
my H
general O
nuclear O
medicine N
rotation N
this O
week N
. O

I H
get O
switched O
around O
-- O
moved O
around O
a O
few O
times N
to O
cover O
some O
residents H
who O
are O
on O
vacation N
, O
so O
I'll O
I H
'll O
be O
at O
other O
spots N
later O
this O
week N
. O

So O
so O
far O
this O
morning N
I've O
I H
've O
just O
read O
a O
few O
studies N
( O
it's O
it O
's H
a O
little O
slow O
in O
the O
morning N
) O
of O
general O
nuclear O
medicine N
because O
a O
lot N
of O
stuff N
takes O
time N
for O
the O
radio N
tracers N
to O
go O
into O
the O
body N
or O
the O
specific O
organ N
we H
are O
targeting O
, O
so O
we H
have O
to O
wait O
a O
little O
bit N
in O
the O
morning N
. O

So O
I've O
I H
've O
done O
three O
lymphoscintigraphies O
. O

For O
lymphoscintigraphies O
we H
basically O
inject O
technetium N
in O
skin N
surrounding O
a O
melanoma N
and O
after O
we H
inject O
we H
wait O
about O
15 O
- O
20 O
minutes N
, O
maybe O
up O
to O
an O
hour N
, O
and O
wait O
for O
that O
radio N
tracer N
to O
travel O
to O
the O
closest O
lymph N
node N
which O
we H
would O
call O
the O
sentinel H
lymph N
node N
. O

What O
we H
do O
is O
we H
mark N
it O
under O
our H
cameras N
and O
then O
the O
patient H
will O
go O
up O
to O
the O
OR N
, O
have O
the O
melanoma N
, O
a O
wide O
excision N
of O
the O
melanoma N
, O
and O
then O
they O
will O
try O
to O
find O
the O
lymph N
node N
that O
we H
marked O
and O
take O
that O
one O
out O
as O
well O
to O
make O
sure O
there's O
there O
's H
no O
metastasis N
. O

So O
I've O
I H
've O
done O
three O
of O
those O
this O
morning N
. O

I H
will O
read O
a O
few O
more O
scans N
coming O
up O
here O
shortly O
and O
just O
trying O
to O
tie O
up O
some O
loose O
ends N
before O
I H
go O
to O
conference N
. O

I'll O
I H
'll O
check O
back O
in O
afterwards O
. O

Ah O
, O
the O
sun N
feels O
so O
good O
on O
the O
face O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
officially O
done O
. O

It O
is O
about O
4:00 O
p.m. O

We H
get O
to O
head N
home N
early O
today N
because O
we H
finished O
off O
the O
scans N
, O
and O
I'm O
I H
'm O
gonna O
gon O
na O
go O
home N
and O
work N
out O
because O
I H
was O
too O
lazy O
to O
do O
it O
this O
morning N
because O
for O
some O
reason N
I H
was O
tired O
from O
having O
a O
weekend N
off O
, O
which O
makes O
no O
sense N
. O

But O
I'm O
I H
'm O
gonna O
gon O
na O
go O
work N
out O
, O
cook H
something O
for O
dinner N
and O
do O
this O
all O
over O
again O
tomorrow N
. O

We're O
We H
're O
on O
a O
different O
rotation N
tomorrow N
so O
stay O
tuned O
to O
find O
out O
which O
one O
. O

Alright O
it O
is O
day N
two O
. O

It O
is O
Tuesday N
and O
today N
I H
got O
pulled O
to O
ultrasound N
. O

Yes O
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
I H
got O
pulled O
on O
today N
, O
but O
I H
did O
, O
so O
probably O
just O
sit O
in O
there O
, O
read O
some O
ultrasounds N
and O
get O
out O
early O
. O

I H
need O
to O
film O
another O
YouTube O
video N
. O

Alright O
so O
I've O
I H
've O
been O
here O
just O
crushing O
ultrasounds N
, O
and O
today N
I've O
I H
've O
been O
feeling N
a O
little O
under O
the O
weather N
so O
I've O
I H
've O
been O
, O
like O
, O
yeah O
, O
I've O
I H
've O
been O
like O
crushing O
these O
all O
day N
today N
and O
then O
I'll O
I H
'll O
show O
you H
what O
else O
I've O
I H
've O
been O
. O

I H
picked O
these O
up O
when O
I H
was O
in O
Amsterdam O
for O
... O

I H
got O
sick O
when O
I H
was O
on O
Croatia O
for O
vacation N
. O

I H
have O
no O
idea N
what O
it O
says N
, O
but O
I H
think O
they're O
they O
're O
cough N
drops N
, O
so O
if O
anybody O
knows O
what O
this O
says N
let O
me H
know O
. O

But O
I'm O
I H
'm O
pretty O
sure O
it's O
it O
's H
just O
cough N
drops N
with O
some O
vitamin N
C H
in O
it O
. O

So O
this O
is O
what O
I H
have O
been O
doing O
all O
day N
is O
crushing O
ultrasounds N
and O
having O
Dutch O
cough N
drops N
. O

So O
if O
anybody O
speaks O
Dutch O
tell O
me H
what O
that O
means O
. O

Oh O
and O
PS O
, O
I H
usually O
try O
to O
avoid O
taking O
medicines N
that O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
read O
the O
name N
of O
but O
I H
had O
someone O
help O
me H
at O
the O
pharmacy N
in O
the O
airport N
. O

She O
spoke O
a O
little O
bit N
of O
English O
and O
I H
think O
those O
are O
actually O
cough N
drops N
, O
so O
, O
that's O
that O
's H
the O
only O
reason N
I'm O
I H
'm O
still O
eating O
them O
today N
. O

You H
can O
tell O
by O
my H
voice N
it's O
it O
's H
a O
little O
on O
the O
sore O
side N
today N
so O
hopefully O
I H
get O
better O
because O
, O
I H
haven't O
have O
n't O
told O
you H
guys H
yet O
, O
but O
I'm O
I H
'm O
going O
somewhere O
this O
weekend N
and O
it's O
it O
's H
gonna O
gon O
na O
be O
fun N
. O

Now O
it's O
it O
's H
time N
to O
get O
back O
to O
work N
. O

So O
I'm O
I H
'm O
officially O
going O
home N
right O
now O
. O

Yeah O
, O
normally O
I H
would O
go O
home N
and O
work N
out O
, O
especially O
since O
it's O
it O
's H
, O
like O
, O
a O
beautiful O
day N
I H
would O
probably O
go O
running O
. O

But O
since O
I H
feel O
kind N
of O
crappy O
today N
I'm O
I H
'm O
just O
going O
to O
go O
home N
, O
hang O
out O
, O
rest N
( O
ambulance N
was O
a O
little O
loud O
sorry O
) O
. O

So O
I'm O
I H
'm O
probably O
just O
gonna O
gon O
na O
go O
home N
and O
rest N
and O
I H
have O
to O
get O
my H
hair N
cut O
today N
for O
my H
big O
trip N
coming O
up O
. O

But O
you H
still O
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
I'm O
I H
'm O
going O
. O

But O
yeah O
that's O
that O
's H
pretty O
much O
it O
, O
hope O
you H
guys H
don't O
do O
n't O
mind N
this O
kind N
of O
like O
random O
vlog O
that O
I'm O
I H
'm O
doing O
, O
but O
I H
just O
wanted O
to O
show O
you H
guys H
kind N
of O
loosely O
like O
how O
a O
week N
is O
and O
the O
life N
of O
a O
radiology N
resident H
. O

So O
hopefully O
you H
guys H
find O
it O
somewhat O
interesting O
, O
and O
if O
you H
do O
I'll O
I H
'll O
keep O
doing O
it O
. O

So O
heading O
home N
now O
. O

Athens O
( O
Greek O
: O
Αθήνα O
, O
Athína O
) O
, O
is O
the O
capital N
city O
of O
Greece O
with O
a O
metropolitan O
population N
of O
3.7 O
million O
inhabitants H
. O

It O
is O
in O
many O
ways N
the O
birthplace N
of O
Classical O
Greece O
, O
and O
therefore O
of O
Western O
civilization N
. O

Understand O

Old O
Athens O

The O
first O
pre-historic O
settlements N
was O
constructed O
in O
3000 O
BC O
around O
the O
hill N
of O
Acropolis O
. O

The O
legend N
says N
that O
the O
King H
of O
Athens O
, O
Theseus O
unified O
the O
ten O
tribes N
of O
early O
Athens O
into O
one O
kingdom N
( O
c. O
1230 O
BC O
) O
. O

This O
process N
of O
synoikismos O
– O
bringing O
together O
in O
one O
home N
– O
created O
the O
largest O
and O
wealthiest O
state N
on O
the O
Greek O
mainland N
, O
but O
it O
also O
created O
a O
larger O
class N
of O
people N
excluded O
from O
political O
life N
by O
the O
nobility N
. O

By O
the O
7th O
century N
BC O
, O
social O
unrest N
had O
become O
widespread O
, O
and O
the O
Areopagus O
appointed O
Draco O
to O
draft O
a O
strict O
new O
law N
code N
( O
hence O
" O
draconian O
" O
) O
. O

When O
this O
failed O
, O
they O
appointed O
Solon O
, O
with O
a O
mandate N
to O
create O
a O
new O
constitution N
( O
594 O
) O
. O

This O
was O
the O
great O
beginning H
of O
a O
new O
social O
revolution N
, O
which O
was O
the O
result N
of O
the O
democracy N
under O
Clisthenes O
( O
508 O
BC O
) O
. O

During O
the O
Middle O
Ages O
, O
Athens O
experienced O
a O
decline N
, O
but O
re-emerged O
under O
Byzantian O
rule N
. O

Athens O
was O
thriving O
and O
prosperous O
during O
the O
Crusades O
, O
actually O
benefiting O
from O
the O
Italian O
trade N
during O
this O
period N
. O

However O
, O
this O
fruitful O
period N
was O
short O
- O
lived O
, O
as O
Greece O
suffered O
badly O
under O
the O
Ottoman O
Empire N
, O
only O
to O
recover O
in O
the O
19th O
century N
as O
the O
capital N
of O
independent O
Greece O
. O

Modern O
Olympic O
Games N

Athens O
hosted O
the O
2004 O
Summer N
Olympic O
Games N
. O

While O
most O
of O
the O
sporting O
venues N
were O
located O
outside O
the O
city O
proper O
- O
in O
various O
locations N
throughout O
Attica O
- O
the O
entire O
urban O
area N
of O
Athens O
underwent O
major O
lasting O
changes O
that O
have O
improved O
the O
quality N
of O
life N
for O
visitors H
and O
residents H
alike O
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
excellent O
transportation N
infrastructure N
that O
was O
completed O
in O
time N
for O
the O
2004 O
Olympics O
( O
from O
new O
freeways N
to O
light O
rail N
systems N
) O
, O
the O
city's O
city O
's H
historic O
center N
underwent O
serious O
renovation N
. O

Most O
notable O
among O
the O
city's O
city O
's H
facelift N
projects N
are O
the O
Unification O
of O
Archaeological O
Sites O
- O
which O
connects O
the O
city's O
city O
's H
classical O
- O
era N
ruins N
and O
monuments N
to O
each O
other O
through O
a O
network N
of O
pleasant O
pedestrianized O
streets N
- O
and O
the O
restoration N
of O
the O
picturesque O
neoclassical O
Thissio O
and O
Pláka O
districts N
. O

The O
ancient O
Olympic O
Games N
took O
place N
in O
Olympia O
from O
776 O
BCE O
to O
394 O
AD O
. O

It O
is O
a O
lengthy O
day N
trip N
from O
Athens O
to O
visit N
Olympia O
, O
but O
quite O
interesting O
. O

Architecture N

Athens O
was O
just O
a O
small O
provincial O
village N
when O
it O
was O
chosen O
in O
the O
1830s N
to O
serve O
as O
the O
national O
capital N
of O
the O
modern O
Greek O
State N
. O

Although O
it O
had O
a O
prestigious O
past O
, O
the O
city's O
city O
's H
political O
, O
economic O
, O
and O
cultural O
importance N
had O
declined O
over O
the O
centuries N
, O
leaving O
behind O
only O
its O
classical O
ruins N
as O
a O
reminder N
of O
better O
times N
. O

With O
the O
decision N
to O
move O
the O
national O
capital N
from O
Nafplio O
to O
Athens O
, O
architects H
and O
city O
planners H
were O
hired O
to O
build O
a O
new O
city O
next O
to O
the O
classical O
ruins N
, O
with O
grand N
neoclassical O
homes N
and O
public O
buildings N
, O
large O
city O
squares N
, O
green O
spaces N
, O
and O
wide O
avenues N
, O
making O
a O
conscious O
, O
decisive O
turn O
from O
the O
city's O
city O
's H
Ottoman O
past O
. O

The O
city O
regained O
its O
importance N
in O
Greek O
civilization N
, O
and O
by O
1900 O
had O
evolved O
into O
a O
very O
attractive O
cosmopolitan O
city O
, O
with O
abundant O
neoclassical O
architecture N
harking O
to O
the O
nation's O
nation N
's H
past O
. O

The O
20th O
century N
however O
, O
marked O
the O
rapid O
development N
of O
Athens O
. O

The O
city O
suffered O
minor O
damage N
during O
WWII O
, O
and O
suffered O
extensive O
urban O
planning N
in O
the O
decades N
that O
followed O
, O
as O
the O
nation N
rapidly O
industrialized O
and O
urbanized O
. O

In O
the O
1960s N
and O
1970s N
, O
many O
19th O
century N
neoclassical O
buildings N
, O
often O
small O
and O
private O
, O
were O
demolished O
to O
make O
way N
for O
office N
buildings N
, O
often O
designed O
by O
great O
Greek O
architects H
. O

The O
city O
also O
expanded O
outward O
through O
rash O
development N
, O
particularly O
towards O
the O
west O
, O
as O
its O
population N
grew O
by O
absorbing O
job N
- O
seekers H
from O
the O
provinces N
. O

With O
the O
onset N
of O
the O
automobile N
, O
public O
officials H
reduced O
the O
city's O
city O
's H
public O
transportation N
services N
without O
foreseeing O
the O
traffic N
gridlock N
and O
smog N
that O
would O
menace O
the O
city O
by O
the O
1980s N
. O

By O
the O
late O
1980s N
and O
early O
1990s N
, O
the O
city's O
city O
's H
reality N
led O
to O
a O
rude O
awakening N
among O
local O
and O
national O
officials H
and O
, O
coupled O
with O
the O
country's O
country N
's H
new O
found O
remarkable O
prosperity N
, O
large O
scale N
projects N
began O
to O
slowly O
regenerate O
the O
city O
and O
undo O
some O
of O
the O
damages N
of O
recent O
decades N
. O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
the O
next O
15 O
years N
, O
money N
was O
poured O
into O
new O
transportation N
infrastructure N
projects N
, O
the O
restoration N
of O
surviving O
neoclassical O
buildings N
, O
the O
gentrification N
of O
the O
city's O
city O
's H
historical O
center N
and O
the O
renovation N
of O
many O
former O
industrial O
areas N
and O
the O
city's O
city O
's H
coastline N
. O

The O
restoration N
of O
charming O
neoclassical O
buildings N
in O
the O
city's O
city O
's H
historical O
center N
has O
been O
accompanied O
by O
the O
construction N
of O
attractive O
post-modern O
buildings N
in O
newer O
districts N
; O
both O
of O
which O
have O
begun O
to O
improve O
the O
aesthetic O
essence N
of O
the O
city O
. O

Athens O
today N
is O
ever O
evolving O
, O
forging O
a O
brand O
new O
identity N
for O
the O
21st O
century N
. O

Climate N

Spring N
and O
late O
autumn N
are O
the O
best O
times N
to O
visit N
Athens O
. O

Summer N
can O
be O
extremely O
hot O
and O
dry O
during O
heatwaves O
, O
but O
this O
rarely O
happens O
. O

Winter N
is O
definitely O
low O
season N
, O
with O
the O
occasional O
rainy O
or O
snowy O
day N
, O
but O
also O
an O
ideal O
time N
to O
save O
money N
while O
enjoying O
the O
city O
without O
countless O
other O
travelers H
and O
tourists H
. O

Whilst O
peak N
traffic N
hour N
can O
be O
a O
bit N
smoggy O
on O
the O
main O
roads N
, O
on O
most O
sunny O
days N
the O
skies N
are O
azure O
blue O
. O

The O
main O
reason N
attributed O
for O
the O
pollution N
of O
Athens O
is O
because O
the O
city O
is O
enclosed O
by O
mountains N
in O
a O
basin N
which O
does O
not O
let O
the O
smog N
leave O
. O

The O
government's O
government N
's H
ban N
on O
diesel N
vehicles N
within O
Athens O
and O
the O
early O
1990s N
initiatives N
to O
improve O
car N
emissions N
have O
greatly O
contributed O
to O
better O
atmospheric O
conditions N
in O
the O
basin N
. O

In O
September O
1944 O
, O
a O

ships N
hiding O
in O
the O
harbor N
were O
sunk O
in O
a O
daring O

The O
result N

around O
ten O

the O
members H

here O
are O
some O
good O
rules N
of O
thumb N
to O
follow O
: O

elderly N
people N
won’t O
wo O
n’t O
like O
crude O
jokes N
; O

stay O
away O
from O
misogynist O
jokes N
if O
you’ve O
you H
’ve O
got O
an O
audience N
full O
of O
women H
; O

people N
of O
a O
specific O
ethnic O
or O
racial O
group N
won’t O
wo O
n’t O
enjoy O
jokes N
making O
fun N
of O
their O
group N

and O
jokes N
requiring O
specialized O
knowledge N
( O
of O
, O
for O
example N
, O
science N
or O
old O
movies N
) O
will O
only O
be O
appreciated O
by O
people N
who O
possess O
that O
knowledge N
. O

The O
more O
you H
know O
about O
your H
audience N
the O
better O
you’ll O
you H
’ll O
be O
able O
to O
tailor O
your H
jokes N
to O
them O
. O

Choose O
great O
material N
. O

You H
can O
find O
fodder H
lots N
of O
places N
— O
from O
your H
life N
, O
joke N
files N
online O
, O
by O
repurposing O
jokes N
you’ve O
you H
’ve O
heard O
in O
the O
past O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

You H
may N
want O
to O
start N
your H
own O
joke N

. O

You H
can O
write O
your H
jokes N
down O
on O

cards N
to O
keep O
them O
handy O
or O
use N
a O
document N
file N
on O
your H
computer N
. O
[ O
1 O
] O

The O
latter O
option N
may N
allow O
for O
easier O
revision N
. O

Decide O
on O
a O
target N
. O

Every O
joke N
has O
a O
“ O
target N
, O
” O
which O
is O
what O
the O
joke N
is O
about O
. O

It’s O
It O
’s H
important O
that O
the O
joke’s O
joke N
’s H
target N
( O
the O
most O
basic O
element N
of O
your H
material N
) O
be O
suited O
to O
your H
audience N
. O

Make O
sure O
it’s O
it O
’s H
a O
target N
your H
audience N
will O
be O
interested O
in O
and O
something O
they’re O
they O
’re O
likely O
willing O
to O
laugh N
at O
. O
[ O
2 O
] O

For O
example N
, O
husbands H
are O
likely O
to O
laugh N
at O
jokes N
about O
wives H
and O
vice O
versa O
; O

students H
will O
typically O
find O
jokes N
about O
school N
and O
teachers H
humorous O
. O

Have O
a O
realistic O
but O
exaggerated O
setup N
. O

The O
opening O
of O
the O
joke N
— O
or O
setup N
— O
should O
have O
a O
basis N
in O
the O
real O
world N
so O
your H
audience N
can O
relate O
to O
it O
, O
but O
it O
should O
also O
include O
exaggeration N
because O
this O
is O
what O
gives O
a O
joke N
its O
humorous O
edge N
. O
[ O
3 O
] O

Think O
of O
the O
setup N
as O
the O
foundation N
of O
a O
story N
. O

It’s O
It O
’s H
a O
fundamental O
part N
of O
the O
joke N
; O

if O
you H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
lay O
a O
good O
foundation N
here O
, O
then O
the O
punchline O
won’t O
wo O
n’t O
make O
sense N
to O
the O
audience N
or O
they O
won’t O
wo O
n’t O
find O
it O
humorous O
. O

Your H
setup N
needs O
to O
be O
both O
realistic O
and O
exaggerated O
in O
order N
to O
be O
funny O
— O

it’s O
it O
’s H
placing O
these O
two O
incongruous O
elements N
side N
by O
side N
that O
makes O
the O
joke N
funny O
. O
[ O
4 O
] O

The O
exaggeration N
can O
be O
slight O
or O
considerable O
— O

it O
just O
depends O
on O
the O
individual O
joke N
. O

Surprise O
with O
the O
punchline O
. O

The O
ending N
of O
the O
joke N
is O
obviously O
crucial O
. O

This O
is O
where O
the O
payoff N
comes O
in O
, O
what O
makes O
the O
joke N
succeed O
or O
fail O
. O

If O
you H
want O
to O
make O
the O
audience N
laugh N
, O
your H
punchline O
needs O
to O
be O
surprising O
. O

Some O
jokes N
also O
have O
what O
is O
called O
a O
tag N
or O
topper H
, O
which O
is O
an O
additional O
punchline O
. O

The O
tag N
builds O
on O
the O
original N
punchline O
or O
twists O
back O
on O
it O
in O
a O
surprising O
way N
. O

Make O
the O
joke N
your H
own O
. O

Lots N
of O
jokes N
rehash O
the O
same O
ground N
and O
sometimes O
they O
retell O
a O
story N
countless O
other O
jokes N
have O
told O
. O

For O
your H
joke N
to O
be O
funny O
, O
it O
has O
to O
surprise N
the O
audience N
in O
some O
way N
, O
which O
means O
it O
has O
to O
seem O
original N
or O
new O
. O

One O
way N
to O
personalize O
a O
joke N
is O
to O
change N
the O
ending N
. O
[ O
5 O
] O

Another O
option N
is O
to O
dress N
the O
joke N
up O
as O
a O
story N
about O
your H
own O
life N
. O

This O
will O
make O
a O
familiar O
joke N
unrecognizable O
. O

It O
may N
also O
make O
it O
particularly O
interesting O
if O
your H
audience N
is O
your H
friend(s) H
. O
[ O

] O

Know O
your H
material N
. O

Practicing O
your H
joke N
is O
crucial O
. O

You H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
need O
to O
have O
it O
completely O
memorized O
— O
in O
fact N
, O
you H
" O
shouldn’t O
should O
n’t O
" O
memorize O
it O
— O
but O
you H
need O
to O
be O
really O
comfortable O
with O
it O
, O
so O
comfortable O
that O
you H
can O
continue O
on O
with O
telling O
it O
even O
if O
you H
get O
nervous O
or O
sidetracked O
, O
which O
is O
very O
possible O
once O
you’re O
you H
’re O
in O
front N
of O
an O
audience N
. O

Memorized O
jokes N
sound O
wooden O
, O
like O
they O
are O
being O
read O
off O
a O
script N
instead O
of O
relayed O
by O
a O
friend H
or O
entertainer H
. O

Good O
jokes N
have O
a O
lot N
of O
details N
and O
personality N
, O
so O
don’t O
do O
n’t O
be O
afraid O
to O
embellish O
. O
[ O
7 O
] O

Try O
different O
things N
out O
and O
see O
what O
feels O
right O
, O
what O
sounds N
best O
. O

Don’t O
Do O
n’t O
use N
a O
joke N
until O
you’re O
you H
’re O
completely O
comfortable O
with O
it O
. O

Try O
recording O
your H
joke N
on O
a O
tape N
player H
and O
playing O
it O
back O
to O
yourself H
. O

If O
you H
hear O
a O
lot N
of O
awkward O
pauses N
or O
“ah”s O
or O
“um”s O
, O
your H
joke N
isn’t O
is O
n’t O
ready O
and O
you H
need O
to O
practice O
more O

You H
can O
also O
try O
practicing O
in O
front N
of O
a O
sympathetic O
friend H

How O
to O
Wash O
Overalls N
in O
a O
Washing O
Machine N

Whether O
you H
are O
a O
working O
man H
or O
just O
a O
little O
cutie O
trying O
to O
stay O
cute O
, O
those O
overalls N
are O
going O
to O
need O
washing N
sooner O
or O
later O
. O

The O
straps N
on O
adults’ O
adults H
’ O
overalls N
often O
get O
so O
twisted O
during O
the O
wash N
that O
one O
wishes O
she O
had O
just O
used O
an O
old O
fashioned O
washboard N
instead O
. O

Your H
appliances N
are O
also O
murder N
on O
the O
straps N
, O
which O
are O
almost O
always O
the O
first O
things N
to O
wear O
out O
on O
your H
overalls N
. O

This O
article N
will O
show O
you H
how O
to O
save O
time N
and O
prevent O
wear O
, O
extending O
the O
life N
of O
your H
overalls N
until O
they O
are O
so O
soft O
you H
could O
wear O
them O
to O
bed N
. O

Steps N

Wash O
alone O
or O
with O
" O
like O
" O
clothing N
. O

It’s O
It O
’s H
best O
to O
wash N
adults’ O
adults H
’ O
overalls N
alone O
, O
especially O
men’s O
men H
’s H
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
okay O
to O
wash N
just O
a O
few O
items N
with O
them O
, O
like O
blue O
jeans N
. O

What O
you H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
want O
to O
wash N
with O
them O
is O
anything O
that O
can O
get O
twisted O
up O
with O
the O
straps N
, O
like O
women’s O
women H
’s H
long O
sleeve N
shirts N
or O
kids’ O
kids H
’ O
blankets N
. O

Think O
similar O
clothing N
, O
minus O
the O
twisty-ness O
. O

Just O
do O
the O
denim N
and O
canvas N
stuff N
together O
. O

Fasten O
the O
straps N
to O
the O
bib N
. O

If O
you H
didn’t O
did O
n’t O
know O
already O
, O
the O
bib N
is O
the O
top O
front N
part N
with O
the O
breast N
pockets N
. O

Go O
ahead O
and O
fasten O
both O
straps N
before O
you H
wash N
. O

This O
will O
help O
keep O
them O
from O
twisting O
up O
during O
the O
wash N
. O

Use O
twist N
ties N
to O
keep O
the O
straps N
fastened O
. O

This O
step N
will O
reapportion O
years N
of O
your H
life N
in O
the O
long O
run O
. O

Don’t O
Do O
n’t O
skip O
it O
. O

Take O
the O
20 O
seconds N
to O
use N
a O
couple N
twist N
ties N
on O
the O
fasteners H
to O
make O
sure O
they O
don’t O
do O
n’t O
come O
loose O
. O

If O
your H
washing N
machine N
is O
worth O
its O
salt O
, O
it O
will O
undo O
those O
straps N
in O
a O
heartbeat N
and O
tie O
them O
in O
a O
sheet N
bend N
unless O
you H
prevent O
it O
. O

All O
it O
takes O
is O
two O
twist N
ties N
and O
a O
few O
seconds N
of O
patience N
. O

Empty O
the O
pockets N
. O

Overalls N
have O
more O
pockets N
than O
pants N
. O

The O
bib N
has O
a O
wallet N
pocket N
and O
a O
watch O
pocket N
. O

Kids H
put O
rocks N
, O
candy N
, O
and O
bugs A
in O
these O
. O

Men H
put O
cell A
phones N
and O
small O
tools N
in O
them O
. O

Women O
defy O
the O
laws N
of O
purse N
- O
space N
, O
so O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
bib N
pockets N
, O
the O
sky N
is O
the O
limit O
. O

Make O
sure O
all O
the O
pockets N
are O
empty O
. O

Move O
the O
strap N
adjusters H
around O
. O

You’ve O
You H
’ve O
probably O
got O
them O
just O
the O
way N
you H
like O
them O
, O
but O
if O
you H
move O
the O
adjusters H
up O
or O
down O
on O
the O
straps N
occasionally O
, O
the O
straps N
will O
last O
longer O
. O

Depending O
on O
the O
adjusters H
, O
you H
may N
be O
able O
to O
leave O
them O
a O
little O
loose O
too O
. O

The O
straps N
wear O
out O
fastest O
around O
the O
adjusters H
over O
the O
course O
of O
numerous O
wash N
and O
dry O
cycles N
( O
not O
to O
mention O
being O
out O
in O
the O
elements N
if O
they O
are O
work N
clothes N
) O
. O

Moving O
them O
distributes O
the O
wear O
and O
tear O
of O
washing N
. O

This O
is O
the O
same O
idea N

About O
XML O

Moving O
information N
across O
the O
Internet N
and O
between O
software N
applications N
has O
always O
been O
difficult O
due O
to O
differences N
in O
data N
formats N
and O
proprietary O
structures N
. O

HTML O
, O
while O
well O
suited O
for O
providing O
text N
and O
image N
display O
information N
for O
Web N
browsers N
, O
is O
limited O
in O
its O
ability N
to O
define O
data N
and O
data N
structures N
. O

HTML O
describes O
how O
a O
Web N
page N
should O
look O
, O
whereas O
XML O
defines O
the O
data N
and O
describes O
how O
the O
data N
should O
be O
structured O
. O

XML O
is O
a O
data N
interchange N
format O
in O
that O
it O
allows O
you H
to O
exchange N
data N
between O
dissimilar O
systems N
or O
applications N
. O

XML O
separates O
the O
data N
from O
the O
presentation N
so O
that O
the O
same O
XML O
data N
can O
be O
presented O
in O
multiple O
ways N
by O
using O
different O
presentation N
files N
. O

XML O
is O
a O
standards-based O
protocol N
that O
is O
governed O
by O
the O
World N
Wide O
Web N
Consortium N
( O
W3C O
) O
. O

The O
XML O
protocol N
is O
a O
set O
of O
rules N
, O
guidelines N
, O
and O
conventions N
for O
designing O
data N
formats N
and O
structures N
, O
in O
a O
way N
that O
produces O
files N
that O
are O
easy O
to O
generate O

easily O
read O
by O
different O

In O

, O
XML O
defined O

are O
unambiguous O
; O
that O

, O
they O
are O
self-describing O
and O
platform-independent O
. O

Like O
HTML O
, O
XML O
makes O
use N
of O
tags N
and O
attributes N
, O
but O
while O
HTML O
specifies O
what O
each O
tag N
and O
attribute N
means O
( O
and O
thus O
how O
the O
data N
between O
them O
will O
look O
in O
a O
browser N
) O
, O
XML O
uses O
the O
tags N
only O
to O
delimit O
pieces N
of O
data N
, O
and O
leaves O
the O
interpretation N
of O
the O
data N
completely O
to O
the O
application N
that O
reads O
it O

About O
importing O
XML O
data N

Access O
provides O
choices N
for O
using O
data N
from O
many O
external O
sources N
. O

XML O
makes O
it O
easier O
to O
transform O
the O
data N
from O
almost O
any O
external O
application N
for O
use N
by O
Access O
. O

You H
can O
: O

Use O
an O
Extensible O
Stylesheet O
Language N
Transformation N
( O
XSLT O
) O
file N
to O
transform O
the O
data N
into O
an O
Access O
data N
format O
. O

You H
can O
use N
the O
Import N
command N
( O
point N
to O
Get O
External O
Data N
on O
the O
File N
menu N
) O
to O
import O
XML O
data N
files N
into O
Access O
. O

This O
command N
displays O
the O
Import N
dialog N
box N
so O
that O
you H
can O
select O
an O
XML O
document N
as O
well O
as O
a O
schema N
, O
which O
describes O
the O
structure N
of O
the O
data N
. O

You H
can O
only O
import O
a O
single N
document N
at O
a O
time N
into O
Access O
. O

The O
data N
must O
be O
in O
a O
format O
that O
Access O
recognizes O
, O
either O
in O
a O
native O
format O
or O
through O
the O
use N
of O
a O
schema N
. O

Note O
that O
when O
importing O
XML O
data N
, O
you H
can O
not O
choose O
a O
subset N
of O
the O
XML O
document N
; O
the O
entire O
file N
has O
to O
be O
imported O
. O

You H
can O
transform O
the O
native O
XML O
data N
into O
a O
specific O
Access O
format O
by O
choosing O
from O
the O
options N
in O
the O
Import N
XML O
dialog N
box N
. O

You H
can O
also O
specify O
whether O
to O
overwrite O
any O
existing O
tables N
or O
append O
to O
existing O
data N
. O

What O
are O
XML O
schemas N

You H
use N
XML O
schemas N
to O
describe O
the O
structure N
of O
data N
in O
a O
common O
format O
that O
customers H
, O
other O
Web N
browsers N
, O
and O
any O
number N
of O
XML-enabled O
software N
programs N
can O
recognize O
. O

Specifically O
, O
schemas N
define O
the O
rules N
of O
an O
XML O
data N
document N
, O
including O
element N
names N
and O
data N
types N
, O
which O
elements N
can O
appear O
in O
combination N
, O
and O
which O
attributes N
are O
available O
for O
each O
element N
. O

Schemas N
provide O
a O
model N
for O
an O
XML O
data N
document N
which O
defines O
the O
arrangement N
of O
tags N
and O
text N
within O
all O
documents N
referencing O
the O
schema N
. O

Access O
supports O
the O
XML O
Schema N
standard N
( O
XSD O
) O
. O

XSD O
is O
a O
proposed O
World N
Wide O
Web N
Consortium N
( O
W3C O
) O
standard N
designed O
as O
a O
basic O
infrastructure N
for O
describing O
the O
type N
and O
structure N
of O
XML O
documents N
. O

By O
using O
a O
schema N
, O
you H
can O
ensure O
that O
any O
XML O
document N
that O
is O
used O
to O
import O
data N
into O
Access O
or O
export N
from O
Access O
to O
another O
format O
contains O
specific O
data N
and O
conforms O
to O
a O
defined O
structure N
. O

You H
can O
also O
provide O
the O
schema N
to O
other O
businesses N
and O
applications N
so O
that O
they O
know O
how O
they O
should O
structure N
any O
data N
they O
provide O
to O
you H
and O
they O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
can O
provide O
their O
schema N
to O
you H

Displaying O
XML O
data N

XML O
syntax N
( O
the O
tags N
and O
their O
placement N
in O
a O
document N
) O
defines O
and O
describes O
the O
data N
in O
an O
XML O
document N
but O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
indicate O
how O
the O
data N
should O
be O
displayed O
. O

In O
earlier O
applications N
and O
in O
some O
current O
uses O
, O
Cascading O
Style N
Sheets N
( O
CSS O
) O
were O
used O
to O
tell O
the O
browser N
how O
to O
display O
the O
XML O
data N
. O

However O
, O
a O
CSS O
isn't O
is O
n't O
always O
a O
good O
choice N
because O
they O
are O
written O
in O
a O
specialized O
language N
which O
means O
that O
the O
developer H
has O
to O
use N
another O
language N
in O
order N
to O
write O
, O
modify O
, O
or O
understand O
the O
structure N
of O
the O
style N
sheet N
. O

A O
CSS O
merely O
allows O
you H
to O
specify O
the O
formatting N
of O
each O
XML O
element N
without O
much O
control N
over O
the O
output N
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand N
, O
an O
Extensible O
Stylesheet O
Language N
( O
XSL O
) O
style N
sheet N
is O
considerably O
more O
flexible O
than O
a O
CSS O
file N
. O

It O
allows O
you H
to O
precisely O
select O
the O
data N
that O
will O
be O
displayed O
, O
to O
specify O
the O
order N
or O
arrangement N
of O
the O
data N
, O
and O
to O
modify O
or O
add O
information N
. O

You H
can O
apply O
a O
filter N
to O
a O
row N
or O
column N
field O
to O
show O
the O
top O
or O
bottom O
n O
items N
based O
on O
a O
total O
. O

For O
example N
, O
you H
can O
filter N
for O
the O
top O
or O
bottom O
25 O
% O
of O
salespeople H
based O
on O
the O
number N
of O
orders N
handled O
. O

Combining O
multiple O
filters N

Filters N
are O
additive O
. O

Each O
filter N
you H
apply O
is O
added O
to O
the O
ones O
you H
already O
have O
in O

. O

However O
, O
when O
you H
apply O
a O
filter N
by O
selection N
, O
the O

filter N
already O
applied O
on O
the O
field O
is O
removed O
before O
the O
filter N
by O
selection N
is O
applied O
. O

Conditional O
filters N
are O
independent O
of O
each O
other O
. O

The O
result N
of O
one O
conditional O
filter N
does O
not O
affect O
the O
result N
of O
another O
. O

An O
autofilter O
is O
always O
applied O
before O
a O
conditional O
filter N
, O
regardless O
of O
the O
order N
in O
which O
you H
applied O
them O
. O

For O
example N
, O
if O
you H
set O
a O
conditional O
filter N
to O
show O
the O
top O
two O
cities N
based O
on O
sales N
, O
followed O
by O
an O
autofilter O
on O
the O
ShippedCity O
field O
to O
include O
only O
five O
cities N
, O
the O
PivotTable O

of O
the O
five O
cities N
you H
selected O
. O

Removing O
and O
reapplying O
a O
filter N

However O
, O
the O

Filter N
settings N
are O
retained O
when O
you H

Also O
, O
if O
you H
remove O
a O

and O
later O
add O
the O
field O
back O
to O
the O
layout N
, O
the O
same O
items N

If O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
retain O
your H
filter N

make O
sure O
the O
AutoFilter O

If O
the O

wondered O

had O
been O

at O
it O

he O
was O

was O
the O
Kodak O

with O
its O
bright O

colors N
. O

The O
scene N
that O
month N
showed O
a O
street N
in O
some O
New O
England O
fishing O
village N
, O
perhaps O
Nantucket O
. O

A O
beautiful O
spring N
light O
shone O
on O
the O
cobblestones N
, O
flowers N
of O
many O
colors N
stood O
in O
window N
boxes N
along O
the O
house N
fronts N
, O
and O
far O
down O
at O
the O
end N
of O
the O
street N
was O
the O
ocean N
, O
with O
its O
white O
waves N
and O
blue O
, O
blue O
water N
. O

Quinn H
remembered O
visiting O
Nantucket O
with O
his O
wife H
long O
ago O
, O
in O
her O
first O
month N
of O
pregnancy N
, O
when O
his O
son H
was O
no O
more O
than O
a O
tiny O
almond N
in O
her O
belly N
. O

He O
found O
it O
painful O
to O
think O
of O
that O
now O
, O
and O
he O
tried O
to O
suppress O
the O
pictures N
that O
were O
forming O
in O
his O
head N
. O

Look O
at O
it O
through O
Auster's O
Auster O
's H
eyes N
, O
he O
said O
to O
himself O
, O
and O
don't O
do O
n't O
think O
of O
anything O
else O
. O

He O
turned O
his O
attention N
to O
the O
photograph N
again O
and O
was O
relieved O
to O
find O
his O
thoughts N
wandering O
to O
the O
subject N
of O
whales A
, O
to O
the O
expeditions N
that O
had O
set O
out O
from O
Nantucket O
in O
the O
last O
century N
, O
to O
Melville H
and O
the O
opening O
pages N
of O
Moby O
Dick O
. O

From O
there O
his O
mind N
drifted O
off O
to O
the O
accounts N
he O
had O
read O
of O
Melville's O
Melville H
's H
last O
years N
– O
the O
taciturn O
old O
man H
working O
in O
the O
New O
York O
customs N
house N
, O
with O
no O
readers H
, O
forgotten O
by O
everyone O
. O

Then O
, O
suddenly O
, O
with O
great O
clarity N
and O
precision N
, O
he O
saw O
Bartleby's O
Bartleby O
's H
window N
and O
the O
blank O
brick N
wall N
before O
him O
. O

Someone O
tapped O
him O
on O
the O
arm N
, O
and O
as O
Quinn H
wheeled O
to O
meet O
the O
assault N
, O
he O
saw O
a O
short O
, O
silent O
man H
holding O
out O
a O
green O
and O
red O
ballpoint N
pen N
to O
him O
. O

Stapled O
to O
the O
pen N
was O
a O
little O
white O
paper N
flag N
, O
one O
side N
of O
which O
read O
: O

On O
the O
other O
side N
of O
the O
flag N
there O
was O
a O
chart N
of O
the O
manual O
alphabet N
– O
LEARN O
TO O
SPEAK O
TO O
YOUR H
FRIENDS H
– O
that O
showed O
the O
hand N
positions N
for O
each O
of O
the O
twenty-six O
letters N
. O

Quinn H
reached O
into O
his O
pocket N
and O
gave O
the O
man H
a O
dollar N
. O

The O
deaf O
mute H
nodded O
once O
very O
briefly O
and O
then O
moved O
on O
, O
leaving O
Quinn H
with O
the O
pen N
in O
his O
hand N
. O

It O
was O
now O
past O
five O
o'clock O
. O

Quinn H
decided O
he O
would O
be O
less O
vulnerable O
in O
another O
spot N
and O
removed O
himself O
to O
the O
waiting O
room N
. O

This O
was O
generally O
a O
grim O
place N
, O
filled O
with O
dust N
and O
people N
with O
nowhere O
to O
go O
, O
but O
now O
, O
with O
the O
rush N
hour N
at O
full O
force O
, O
it O
had O
been O
taken O
over O
by O
men H
and O
women H
with O
briefcases N
, O
books N
, O
and O
newspapers N
. O

Quinn H
had O
trouble N
finding O
a O
seat N
. O

After O
searching O
for O
two O
or O
three O
minutes N
, O
he O
finally O
found O
a O
place N
on O
one O
of O
the O
benches N
, O
wedging O
himself O
between O
a O
man H
in O
a O
blue O
suit N
and O
a O
plump O
young O
woman H
. O

The O
man H
was O
reading N
the O
sports N
section N
of O
the O
Times O
, O
and O
Quinn H
glanced O
over O
to O
read O
the O
account N
of O
Mets O
' O
loss N
the O
night O
before O
. O

He O
had O
made O
it O
to O
the O
third O
or O
fourth O
paragraph N
when O
the O
man H
turned O
slowly O
toward O
him O
, O
gave O
him O
a O
vicious O
stare N
, O
and O
jerked O
the O
paper N
out O
of O
view O
. O

After O
that O
, O
a O
strange O
thing N
happened O
. O

Quinn H
turned O
his O
attention N
to O
the O
young O
woman H
on O
his O
right O
, O
to O
see O
if O
there O
was O
any O
reading N
material N
in O
that O
direction N
. O

Quinn H
guessed O
her O
age N
at O
around O
twenty O
. O

There O
were O
several O
pimples N
on O
her O
left O
cheek N
, O
obscured O
by O
a O
pimpish O
smear N
of O
pancake N
makeup N
, O
and O
a O
wad N
of O
chewing O
gum N
was O
crackling O
in O
her O
mouth N
. O

She O
was O
, O
however O
, O
reading N
a O
book O
, O
a O
paperback N
with O
a O
lurid O
cover O
, O
and O
Quinn H
leaned O
over O
ever O
so O
slightly O
to O
his O
right O
to O
catch O
a O
glimpse N
of O
the O
title N
. O

Against O
all O
his O
expectations N
, O
it O
was O
a O
book O
he O
himself O
had O
written O
– O
Suicide N
Squeeze N
by O
William H
Wilson H
, O
the O
first O
of O
the O
Max H
Work H
novels N
. O

Quinn H
had O
often O
imagined O
this O
situation N
: O
the O
sudden O
, O
unexpected O
pleasure N
of O
encountering O
one O
of O
his O
readers H
. O

He O
had O
even O
imagined O
the O
conversation N
that O
would O
follow O
: O
he O
, O
suavely O
diffident O
as O
the O
stranger H
praised O
the O
book O
, O
and O
then O
, O
with O
great O
reluctance N
and O
modesty N
, O
agreeing O
to O
autograph O
the O
title N
page N
, O
since O
you H
insist O
. O

But O
now O
that O
the O
scene N
was O
taking O
place N
, O
he O
felt O
quite O
disappointed O
, O
even O
angry O
. O

He O
did O
not O
like O
the O
girl H
sitting O
next O
to O
him O
, O
and O
it O
offended O
him O
that O
she O
should O
be O
casually O
skimming O
the O
pages N
that O
had O
cost N
him O
so O
much O
effort N
. O

His O
impulse N
was O
to O
tear O
the O
book O
out O
of O
her O
hands N
and O
run O
across O
the O
station N
with O
it O
. O

He O
looked O
at O
her O
face O
again O
, O
trying O
to O
hear O
the O
words N
she O
was O
sounding O
out O
in O
her O
head N
, O
watching O
her O
eyes N
as O
they O
darted O
back O
and O
forth O
across O
the O
page N
. O

He O
must O
have O
been O
looking O
too O
hard O
, O
for O
a O
moment N
later O
she O
turned O
to O
him O
with O
an O
irritated O
expression N
on O
her O
face O
and O
said O
, O
You H
got O
a O
problem N
, O
mister N
? O

Quinn H
smiled O
weakly O
. O
No O
problem N
, O
he O
said O
. O

I H
was O
just O
wondering O
if O
you H
liked O
the O
book O
. O

The O
girl H
shrugged O
. O
I've O
I H
've O
read O
better O
and O
I've O
I H
've O
read O
worse O
. O

Quinn H
wanted O
to O
drop O
the O
conversation N
right O
there O
, O
but O
something O
in O
him O
persisted O
. O

Before O
he O
could O
get O
up O
and O
leave O
, O
the O
words N
were O
already O
out O
of O
his O
mouth N
. O
Do O
you H
find O
it O
exciting O
? O

The O
girl H
shrugged O
again O
and O
cracked O
her O
gum N
loudly O
. O
Sort N
of O
. O
There's O
There O
's H
a O
part N
where O
the O
detective H
gets O
lost O
that's O
that O
's H
kind N
of O
scary O
. O

Is O
he O
a O
smart O
detective H
? O

Yeah O
, O
he's O
he O
's H
smart O
. O
But O
he O
talks N
too O
much O
. O

You'd O
You H
'd O
like O
more O
action N
? O

I H
guess O
so O
. O

If O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
why O
do O
you H
go O
on O
reading N
? O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
. O
The O
girl H
shrugged O
once O
again O
. O

It O
passes O
the O
time N
, O
I H
guess O
. O

Anyway O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
no O
big O
deal N
. O
It's O
It O
's H
just O
a O
book O
. O

He O
was O
about O
to O
tell O
her O
who O
he O
was O
, O
but O
then O
he O
realized O
that O
it O
made O
no O
difference N
. O

The O
girl H
was O
beyond O
hope O
. O

For O
five O
years N
he O
had O
kept O
William H
Wilson's O
Wilson H
's H
identity N
a O
secret N
, O
and O
he O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
about O
to O
give O
it O
away O
now O
, O
least O
of O
all O
to O
an O
imbecile O
stranger H
. O

Still O
, O
it O
was O
painful O
, O
and O
he O
struggled O
desperately O
to O
swallow O
his O
pride N
. O

Rather O
than O
punch O
the O
girl H
in O
the O
face O
, O
he O
abruptly O
stood O
up O
from O
his O
seat N
and O
walked O
away O
. O

At O
six-thirty O
he O
posted O
himself O
in O
front N
of O
gate N
twenty-four O
. O

The O
train N
was O
due O
to O
arrive O
in O
time N
, O
and O
from O
his O
vantage N
in O
the O
center N
of O
the O
doorway N
, O
Quinn H
judged O
that O
his O
chances N
of O
seeing O
Stillman O
were O
good O
. O

He O
took O
out O
the O
photograph N
from O
his O
pocket N
and O
studied O
it O
again O
, O

paying O
special O
attention N
to O
the O
eyes N
. O

He O
remembered O
having O
read O
somewhere O
that O
the O
eyes N
were O
the O
one O
feature O
of O
the O
face O
that O
never O
changed O
. O

From O
childhood N
to O
old O
age N
they O
remained O
the O
same O
, O
and O
a O
man H
with O
the O
head N
to O
see O
it O
could O
theoretically O
look O
into O
the O
eyes N
of O
a O
boy H
in O
a O
photograph N
and O
recognize O
the O
same O
person H
as O
an O
old O
man H
. O

Quinn H
had O
his O
doubts N
, O
but O
this O
was O
all O
he O
had O
to O
go O
on O
, O
his O
only O
bridge N
to O
the O
present O
. O

Once O
again O
, O
however O
, O
Stillman's O
Stillman O
's H
face O
told O
him O
nothing O
. O

The O
train N
pulled O
into O
the O
station N
, O
and O
Quinn H
felt O
the O
noise N
of O
it O
shoot O
through O
his O
body N
: O
a O
random O
, O
hectic O
din N
that O
seemed O
to O
join O
with O
his O
pulse N
, O
pumping O
his O
blood N
in O
raucous O
spurts N
. O

His O
head N
then O
filled O
with O
Peter H
Stillman's O
Stillman O
's H
voice N
, O
as O
a O
barrage N
of O
nonsense N
words N
clattered O
against O
the O
walls N
of O
his O
skull N
. O

He O
told O
himself O
to O
stay O
calm N
. O

But O
that O
did O
little O
good O
. O
In O
spite N
of O
what O
he O
had O
been O
expecting O
of O
himself O
at O
this O
moment N
, O
he O
was O
excited O
. O

The O
train N
was O
crowded O
, O
and O
as O
the O
passengers H
started O
filling O
the O
ramp N
and O
walking O
toward O
him O
, O
they O
quickly O
became O
a O
mob N
. O

Quinn H
flapped O
the O
red O
notebook N
nervously O
against O
his O
right O
thigh N
, O
stood O
on O
his O
tiptoes N
, O
and O
peered O
into O
the O
throng N
. O

Soon O
the O
people N
were O
surging O
around O
him O
. O

There O
were O
men H
and O
women H
, O
children H
and O
old O
people N
, O
teenagers H
and O
babies H
, O
rich O
people N
and O
poor O
people N
, O
black O
men H
and O
white O
women H
, O
white O
men H
and O
black O
women H
, O
Orientals H
and O
Arabs H
, O
men H
in O
brown O
and O
gray O
and O
blue O
and O
green O
, O
women H
in O
red O
and O
white O
and O
yellow O
and O
pink O
, O
children H
in O

, O
children H
in O

, O
children H
in O

boots N
, O
fat O
people N
and O
thin O
people N
, O
tall O
people N
and O
short O
people N
, O
each O
one O
different O
from O
all O
the O
others O
, O
each O
one O
irreducibly O
himself O
. O

Quinn H
watched O
them O
all O
, O
anchored O
to O
his O
spot N
, O
as O
if O
his O
whole O
being O
had O
been O
exiled O
to O
his O
eyes N
. O

Each O
time N
an O
elderly N
man H
approached O
, O
he O
braced O
himself O
for O
it O
to O
be O
Stillman O
. O

They O
came O
and O
went O
too O
quickly O
for O
him O
to O
indulge O
in O
disappointment N
, O
but O
in O
each O
old O
face O
he O
seemed O
to O
find O
an O
augur H
of O
what O
the O
real O
Stillman O
would O
be O
like O
, O
and O
he O
rapidly O
shifted O
his O
expectations N
with O
each O
new O
face O
, O
as O
if O
the O
accumulation N
of O
old O
men H
was O
heralding O
the O
imminent O
arrival H
of O
Stillman O
himself O
. O

For O
one O
brief O
instant N
Quinn H
thought O
, O
So O
this O
is O
what O
detective H
work N
is O
like O
. O
But O
other O
than O
that O
he O
thought O
nothing O
. O

He O
watched O
. O

Immobile O
among O
the O
moving O
crowd N
, O
he O
stood O
there O
and O
watched O
. O

The O
next O
morning N
, O
and O
for O
many O
mornings N
to O
follow O
, O
Quinn H
posted O
himself O
on O
a O
bench N
in O
the O
middle N
of O
the O
traffic N
island N
at O
Broadway O
and O
99th O
Street N
. O

I H
wish O
it O
was O
. O
But O
this O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
literature N
. O

With O
what O
, O
then O
? O

Quinn H
paused O
, O
looked O
around O
the O
room N
without O
seeing O
anything O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
start N
. O

I've O
I H
've O
a O
feeling N
there's O
there O
's H
been O
a O
terrible O
mistake N
. O

I H
came O
here O
looking O
for O
Paul H
Auster O
, O
the O
private O
detective H
. O

The O
what O
? O
Auster O
laughed O
, O
and O
in O
that O
laugh N
everything O
was O
suddenly O
blown O
to O
bits N
. O

Quinn H
realized O
that O
he O
was O
talking O
nonsense N
. O

He O
must O
just O
as O
well O
have O
asked O
for O
Chief H
Sitting O
Bull A
– O
the O
effect N
would O
have O
been O
no O
different O
. O

The O
private O
detective H
, O
he O
repeated O
softly O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
afraid O
you've O
you H
've O
got O
the O
wrong O
Paul H
Auster O
. O

You're O
You H
're O
the O
only O
one O
in O
the O
book O
. O

That O
might O
be O
, O
said O
Auster O
. O

But O
I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
a O
detective H
. O

Who O
are O
you H
then O
? O

What O
do O
you H
do O
? O

I'm O
I H
'm O
a O
writer O
. O

A O
writer O
? O
Quinn H
spoke O
the O
word N
as O
though O
it O
were O
a O
lament N
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
sorry O
. O
Auster O
said O
. O

But O
that's O
that O
's H
what O
I H
happen O
to O
be O
. O

If O
that's O
that O
's H
true O
, O
then O
there's O
there O
's H
no O
hope O
. O

The O
whole O
thing N
is O
a O
bad O
dream N
. O

I H
have O
no O
idea N
what O
you're O
you H
're O
talking O
about O
. O

Quinn H
told O
him O
. O

He O
began O
at O
the O
beginning H
and O
went O
through O
the O
entire O
story N
, O
step N
by O
step N
. O

The O
pressure N
had O
been O
building O
up O
in O
him O
since O
Stillman's O
Stillman O
's H
disappearance N
that O
morning N
, O
and O
it O
came O
out O
of O
him O
now O
as O
a O
torrent N
of O
words N
. O

He O
told O
of O
the O
phone N
calls O
for O
Paul H
Auster O
, O
of O
his O
inexplicable O
acceptance N
of O
the O
case N
, O
of O
his O
meeting O
with O
Peter H
Stillman O
, O
of O
his O
conversation N
with O
Virginia H
Stillman O
, O
of O
his O
reading N
Stillman's O
Stillman O
's H
book O
, O
of O
his O
following O
Stillman O
from O
Grand O
Central O
Station N
, O
of O
Stillman's O
Stillman O
's H
daily O
wanderings N
, O
of O
the O
carpetbag N
and O
the O
broken O
objects N
, O
of O
the O
disquieting O
maps N
that O
formed O
letters N
of O
the O
alphabet N
, O
of O
his O
talks N
with O
Stillman O
, O
of O
Stillman's O
Stillman O
's H
disappearance N
from O
the O
hotel N
. O

When O
he O
had O
come O
to O
the O
end N
, O
he O
said O
, O
Do O
you H
think O
I'm O
I H
'm O
crazy O
? O

No O
, O
said O
Auster O
, O
who O
had O
listened O
attentively O
to O
Quinn's O
Quinn H
's H
monologue N

If O
I H
had O
been O
in O
your H
place N
, O
I H
probably O
would O
have O
done O
the O
same O
thing N
. O

These O
words N
came O
as O
a O
great O
relief N
to O
Quinn H
, O
as O
if O
, O
at O
long O
last O
, O
the O
burden N
was O
no O
longer O
his O
alone O
. O

He O
felt O
like O
taking O
Auster O
in O
his O
arms N
and O
declaring O
his O
friendship N
for O
life N
. O

You H
see O
, O
said O
Quinn H
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
making O
it O
up O
. O
I H
even O
have O
proof N
. O

He O
took O
out O
his O
wallet N
and O
removed O
the O
five-hundred-dollar O
check O
that O
Virginia H
Stillman O
had O
written O
two O
weeks N
earlier O
. O

He O
handed O
it O
to O
Auster O
. O
You H
see O
, O
he O
said O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
even O
made O
out O
to O
you H
. O

Auster O
looked O
the O
check O
over O
carefully O
and O
nodded O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
perfectly O
normal O
check O
. O

Well O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
yours O
, O
said O
Quinn H
. O

I H
want O
you H
to O
have O
it O
. O

I H
couldn't O
could O
n't O
possibly O
accept O
it O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
of O
no O
use N
to O
me H
. O
Quinn H
looked O
around O
the O
apartment N
and O
gestured O
vaguely O
. O

Buy O
yourself H
some O
more O
books N
. O
Or O
a O
few O
toys N
for O
your H
kid H
. O

This O
is O
money N
you've O
you H
've O
earned O
. O

You H
deserve O
to O
have O
it O
yourself H
. O
Auster O
paused O
for O
a O
moment N
. O

There's O
There O
's H
one O
thing N
I'll O
I H
'll O
do O
for O
you H
, O
though O
. O

Since O
the O
check O
is O
in O
my H
name N
, O
I'll O
I H
'll O
cash O
it O
for O
you H
. O

I'll O
I H
'll O
take O
it O
to O
my H
bank N
tomorrow N
morning N
, O
deposit O
it O
in O
my H
account N
, O
and O
give O
you H
the O
money N
when O
it O
clears O
. O

Quinn H
did O
not O
say O
anything O
. O

All O
right O
? O
Auster O
asked O
. O

Is O
it O
agreed O
? O

All O
right O
, O
said O
Quinn H
at O
last O
. O

We'll O
We H
'll O
see O
what O
happens O
. O

Auster O
put O
the O
check O
on O
the O
coffee N
table N
, O
as O
if O
to O
say O
the O
matter N
had O
been O
settled O
. O

Then O
he O
leaned O
back O
on O
the O
sofa N
and O
looked O
Quinn H
in O
the O
eyes N
. O

There's O
There O
's H
a O
much O
more O
important O
question N
than O
the O
check O
, O
he O
said O
. O

The O
fact N
that O
my H
name N
has O
been O
mixed O
up O
in O
this O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
understand O
it O
at O
all O
. O

I H
wonder O
if O
you've O
you H
've O
had O
any O
trouble N
with O
your H
phone N
lately O
. O

Wires N
sometimes O
get O
crossed O
. O
A O
person H
tries O
to O
call O
a O
number N
, O
and O
even O
though O
he O
dials O
correctly O
, O
he O
gets O
someone O
else O
. O

Yes O
, O
that's O
that O
's H
happened O
to O
me H
before O
. O

But O
even O
if O
my H
phone N
was O
broken O
, O
that O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
explain O
the O
real O
problem N
. O

It O
would O
tell O
us H
why O
the O
call O
went O
to O
you H
, O
but O
not O
why O
they O
wanted O
to O
speak O
to O
me H
in O
the O
first O
place N
. O

Is O
it O
possible O
that O
you H
know O
the O
people N
involved O
? O

I've O
I H
've O
never O
heard O
of O
the O
Stillmans O
. O

Maybe O
someone O
wanted O
to O
play O
a O
practical O
joke N
on O
you H
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
hang O
around O
with O
people N
like O
that O
. O

You H
never O
know O
. O

But O
the O
fact N
is O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
a O
joke N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
a O
real O
case N
with O
real O
people N
. O

Yes O
, O
said O
Quinn H
after O
a O
long O
silence N
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
aware O
of O
that O
. O

They O
had O
come O
to O
the O
end N
of O
what O
they O
could O
talk O
about O
. O

Beyond O
that O
point N
there O
was O
nothing O
: O
the O
random O
thoughts N
of O
men H
who O
knew O
nothing O
. O

Quinn H
realized O
that O
he O
should O
be O
going O
. O

He O
had O
been O
there O
almost O
an O
hour N
, O
and O
the O
time N
was O
approaching O
for O
his O
call O
to O
Virginia H
Stillman O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
he O
was O
reluctant O
to O
move O
. O

The O
chair N
was O
comfortable O
, O
and O
the O
beer N
had O
gone O
slightly O
to O
his O
head N
. O

This O
Auster O
was O
the O
first O
intelligent O
person H
he O
had O
spoken O
to O
in O
a O
long O
time N
. O

He O
had O
read O
Quinn's O
Quinn H
's H
old O
work N
, O
he O
had O
admired O
it O
, O
he O
had O
been O
looking O
forward O
to O
more O
. O

The O
Archbishop H
is O
really O
very O
handsome O
, O
with O
his O
full O
cheeks N
, O
his O
long O
clear O
dark-green O
eyes N
, O
and O
the O
short O
strong O
beard N
. O

His O
church N
is O
venerable O
rich O
and O
beautiful O
. O

It O
contains O
the O
head N
of O
Saint O
James H
the O
brother H
of O
John H
and O
many O
relics N
. O

The O
house N
of O
Annas O
, O
in O
which O
Jesus H
was O
questioned O
and O
struck O
, O
is O
within O
the O
compound N
. O

The O
church's O
church N
's H
manuscript N
collection N
is O
the O
largest O
outside O
Soviet O
Armenia O
. O

The O
antique O
tiles N
are O
gorgeous O
. O

But O
all O
these O
things N
are O
in O
some O
way N
external O
. O

We H
outsiders H
are O
not O
stable O
enough O
to O
appreciate O
them O
. O

We H
inherit O
our H
mode N
of O
appreciation N
from O
the O
Victorians H
, O
from O
a O
time N
of O
safety N
and O
leisure N
, O
when O
dinner N
guests H
knew O
better O
than O
to O
smoke N
after O
the O
main O
course O
, O
when O
Levantines H
were O
Levantines H
and O
culture N
was O
still O
culture N
. O

But O
in O
these O
days N
of O
armored O
attacks N
on O
Yom O
Kippur O
, O
of O
Vietnams O
, O
Watergates O
, O
Mansons O
, O
Amins O
, O
terrorist H
massacres N
at O
Olympic O
Games N
, O
what O
are O
illuminated O
manuscripts N
, O
what O
are O
masterpieces N
of O
wrought O
iron N
, O
what O
are O
holy O
places N
? O

We H
soon O
get O
around O
to O
contemporary O
matters N
. O

A O
call O
to O
the O
telephone N
; O

the O
Archbishop H
excuses O
himself O
in O
two O
languages N
and O
tells O
us H
when O
he O
comes O
back O
that O
he O
has O
been O
speaking O
to O
one O
of O
his O
Lebanese O
friends H
calling O
from O
Cyprus O
or O
from O
Greece O
. O

He O
sits O
down O
, O
saying O
that O
the O
influence N
of O
Yasir O
Arafat O
is O
evidently O
weakening O
and O
fading O
. O

Arafat O
was O
unable O
to O
complete O
the O
classic O
guerrilla H
pattern N
and O
bring O
the O
masses N
into O
the O
struggle N
. O

Then O
someone O
says N
that O
it O
can't O
ca O
n't O
be O
long O
now O
before O
the O
Russians H
write O
Arafat O
off O
. O

They O
have O
undoubtedly O
recognized O
their O
failure N
in O
the O
Arab H
world N
and O
may N
even O
be O
preparing O
to O
reopen O
diplomatic O
relations N
with O
Israel O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
dinner N
guests H
agree O
that O
Russia's O
Russia O
's H
internal O
difficulties N
are O
so O
grave O
it O
may N
have O
to O
draw O
away O
from O
Syria O
. O

Indeed O
, O
it O
may N
be O
forced O
to O
retreat N
from O
the O
Middle O
East O
and O
concentrate O
on O
its O
domestic O
problems N
. O

To O
avoid O
collapse N
the O
Russians H
may N
be O
driven O
into O
a O
war N
with O
China O
. O

Secretary-of-State O
Henry H
Kissinger O
has O
won O
the O
Middle O
Eastern O
struggle N
by O
drawing O
Egypt O
into O
the O
American O
camp N
. O

He O
is O
a O
genius H
. O

The O
Russians H
are O
in O
disarray N
, O
perhaps O
in O
retreat N
. O

I H
have O
been O
hearing O
conversations N
like O
this O
one O
for O
half O
a O
century N
. O

I H
well O
remember O
what O
intelligent O
, O
informed O
people N
were O
saying O
in O
the O
last O
years N
of O
the O
Weimar O
Republic N
, O
what O
they O
told O
one O
another O
in O
the O
first O
days N
after O
Hindenburg O
had O
brought O
in O
Hitler H
. O

I H
recall O
table N
talk O
from O
the O
times N
of O
Leon H
Blum O
and O
Edouard O
Daladier O
. O

I H
remember O
what O
people N
said O
about O
the O
Italian O
adventure N
in O
Ethiopia O
and O
about O
the O
Spanish O
Civil O
War N
and O
the O
Battle N
of O
Britain O
. O

Such O
intelligent O
discussion N
hasn't O
has O
n't O
always O
been O
wrong O
. O

What O
is O
wrong O
with O
it O
is O
that O
the O
discussants H
invariably O
impart O
their O
own O
intelligence N
to O
what O
they O
are O
discussing O
. O

Later O
, O
historical O
studies N
show O
that O
what O
actually O
happened O
was O
devoid O
of O
anything O
like O
such O
intelligence N
. O

It O
was O
absent O
from O
Flanders O
Field O
and O
from O
Versailles O
, O
absent O
when O
the O
Ruhr O
was O
taken O
, O
absent O
from O
Teheran O
, O
Yalta O
, O
Potsdam O
, O
absent O
from O
British O
policy N
at O
the O
time N
of O
the O
Palestine O
Mandate N
, O
absent O
before O
, O
during O
, O
and O
after O
the O
Holocaust O
. O

History N
and O
politics N
are O
not O
at O
all O
like O
the O
notions N
developed O
by O
intelligent O
, O
informed O
people N
. O

Tolstoi O
made O
this O
clear O
in O
the O
opening O
pages N
of O
War N
and O
Peace N
. O

In O
Anna H
Scherer's O
Scherer O
's H
salon N
, O
the O
elegant O
guests H
are O
discussing O
the O
scandal N
of O
Napoleon H
and O
the O
Duc O
d'Enghien O
, O
and O
Prince H
Andrei H
says N
that O
after O
all O
there O
is O
a O
great O
difference N
between O
Napoleon H
the O
Emperor H
and O
Napoleon H
the O
private O
person H
. O

There O
are O
raisons O
d'etat O
and O
there O
are O
private O
crimes N
. O

And O
the O
talk O
goes O
on O
. O

What O
is O
still O
being O
perpetuated O
in O
all O
civilized O
discussion N
is O
the O
ritual N
of O
civilized O
discussion N
itself O
. O

Tatu O
agrees O
with O
the O
Archbishop H
about O
the O
Russians H
. O

So O
that O

In O
my H
letter N
to O
Le O
Monde O
I H
had O
said O
that O
in O
the O
French O
tradition N
there O
were O
two O
attitudes N
toward O
the O
Jews H
: O
a O
revolutionary O
attitude N
which O
had O
resulted O
in O
their O
enfranchisement N
, O
and O
an O
anti-Semitic O
one O
. O

The O
intellectual H
leaders H
of O
the O
Enlightenment N
were O
decidedly O
anti-Semitic O
. O

I H
asked O
which O
of O
the O
two O
attitudes N
would O
prevail O
in O
twentieth-century O
France O
the O
century N
of O
the O
Dreyfus O
affair N
and O
of O
the O
Vichy O
government N
. O

The O
position N
taken O
by O
Foreign O
Minister H
Maurice H
Jobert O
in O
the O
October O
War N
of O
1973 O
was O
that O
the O
Palestinian O
Arabs H
had O
a O
natural O
and O
justified O
desire N
to O
" O
go O
home N
. O
" O

I H
expressed O
, O
politely O
, O
the O
hope O
that O
the O
other O
attitude N
, O
the O
revolutionary O
one O
, O
would O
not O
be O
abandoned O
. O

I H
made O
sure O
that O
my H
letter N
would O
be O
delivered O
. O

Eugene H
Ionescu O
gave O
the O
editors H
one O
copy N
of O
it O
; O
another O
was O
handed O
to O
them O
by O
Manes O
Sperber O
, O
the O
novelist H
. O

The O
letter N
was O
never O
acknowledged O
. O

Since O
1973 O
, O
Le O
Monde O
has O
openly O
taken O
the O
side N
of O
the O
Arabs H
in O
their O
struggle N
with O
Israel O

An O

in O

once O

as O
we H

side N

he O
put O
his O
arm N

called O

We'd O
We H
'd O
only O
met O
ten O

He O

His O
eyes N

I H
was O

His O
heart N

It O
opened O
like O
a O

But O
it O
did O
not O

me H
the O
time N

day N

" O
But O
don't O
do O
n't O
Americans H

that O
Sadat O

Nazi H

the O
librarian H

Well O
, O

well-informed O

it O

a O
government N
It O
has O
a O
state N
department N

its O
own O

and O
its O
high O
councils N

probably O
decided O
that O
it O
would O
be O
impolitic O
at O
this O
moment N

call O
attention N

Sadat's O
Sadat O

I H

I H
tell O

" O

n't O

" O

What O
disturbs O
is O
whether O
Americans H
understand O
the O
world N
at O
all O
, O
whether O
they O
are O
a O
match H
for O
the O
Russians H
the O
Sadats O
are O
in O
themselves O
comparatively O
unimportant O
. O

To O
dissident H
Russian O
writers H
like O
Lev H
Navrozov O
, O
the O
Americans H
can O
never O
be O
a O
match H
for O
the O
Russians H
. O

He O
quotes O
from O
Dostoevski's O
Dostoevski O
's H
The O
House N
of O
the O
Dead O
a O
conversation N
between O
the O
writer O
and O
a O
brutal O
murderer H
, O
one O
of O
those O
criminals H
who O
fascinated O
him O
. O

I H
haven't O
have O
n't O
the O
book O
handy O
, O
so O
I H
paraphrase O
. O

" O
Why O
are O
you H
so O
kind N
to O
me H
? O
" O
Dostoevski O
asks O
. O

And O
the O
murderer H
, O
speaking O
to O
one O
of O
the O
geniuses H
of O
the O
nineteenth O
century N
, O
answers N
, O
" O
Because O
you H
are O
so O
simple O
that O
one O
can O
not O
help O
feeling N
sorry O
for O
you H
. O
" O

Even O
when O
he O
robbed O
Dostoevski O
, O
he O
pitied O
him O
as O
one O
might O
" O
a O
little O
cherub-like O
child H
. O
" O

Navrozov O
, O
exceedingly O
intelligent O
but O
, O
to O
a O
Westerner H
, O
curiously O
deformed O
( O
how O
could O
an O
independent O
intellectual H
in O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
escape O
deformity N
? O
) O
, O
sees O
us H
, O
the O
Americans H
, O
as O
children H
at O
whom O
the O
Stalins O
smile N
through O
their O
mustachios N
. O

Perhaps O
there O
is O
a O
certain O
Vautrin-admiring O
romanticism N
in O
this O
. O

People N
were O
arriving O
, O
and O
the O
younger O
one O
was O
walking O
back O
and O
forth O
introducing O
them O
. O

The O
old O
one O
sat O
on O
her O
chair N
. O

Her O
flat O
cloth N
slippers N
were O
propped O
up O
on O
a O
foot-warmer O
, O
and O
a O
cat A
reposed O
on O
her O
lap N
. O

She O
wore O
a O
starched O
white O
affair N
on O
her O
head N
, O
had O
a O
wart N
on O
one O
cheek N
, O
and O
silver-rimmed O
spectacles N
hung O
on O
the O
tip N
of O
her O
nose N
. O

She O
glanced O
at O
me H
above O
the O
glasses N
. O

The O
swift O
and O
indifferent O
placidity N
of O
that O
look O
troubled O
me H
. O

Two O
youths H
with O
foolish O
and O
cheery O
countenances N
were O
being O
piloted O
over O
, O
and O
she O
threw O
at O
them O
the O
same O
quick O
glance N
of O
unconcerned O
wisdom N
. O

She O
seemed O
to O
know O
all O
about O
them O
and O
about O
me H
too O
. O

An O
eerie O
feeling N
came O
over O
me H
. O

She O
seemed O
uncanny O
and O
fateful O
. O

Often O
far O
away O
there O
I H
thought O
of O
these O
two O
, O
guarding O
the O
door N
of O
Darkness N
, O
knitting O
black O
wool N
as O
for O
a O
warm O
pall N
, O
one O
introducing O
, O
introducing O
continuously O
to O
the O
unknown O
, O
the O
other O
scrutinizing O
the O
cheery O
and O
foolish O
faces N
with O
unconcerned O
old O
eyes N
. O

Ave O
! O
Old O
knitter H
of O
black O
wool N
. O
Morituri O
te O
salutant O
. O

Not O
many O
of O
those O
she O
looked O
at O
ever O
saw O
her O
again O
– O
not O
half O
, O
by O
a O
long O
way N
. O

There O
was O
yet O
a O
visit N
to O
the O
doctor H
. O

A O
simple O
formality N
assured O
me H
the O
secretary H
, O
with O
an O
air O
of O
taking O
an O
immense O
part N
in O
all O
my H
sorrows N
. O

Accordingly O
a O
young O
chap H
wearing O
his O
hat N
over O
the O
left O
eyebrow N
, O
some O
clerk H
I H
suppose O
, O
– O
there O
must O
have O
been O
clerks H
in O
the O
business N
, O
though O
the O
house N
was O
as O
still O
as O
a O
house N
in O
a O
city O
of O
the O
dead O
, O
– O
came O
from O
somewhere O
up-stairs O
, O
and O
led O
me H
forth O
. O

He O
was O
shabby O
and O
careless O
, O
with O
ink-stains O
on O
the O
sleeves N
of O
his O
jacket N
, O
and O
his O
cravat N
was O
large O
and O
billowy O
, O
under O
a O
chin N
shaped O
like O
the O
toe N
of O
an O
old O
boot N
. O

It O
was O
a O
little O
too O
early O
for O
the O
doctor H
, O
so O
I H
proposed O
a O
drink O
, O
and O
thereupon O
he O
developed O
a O
vein N
of O
joviality N
. O
As O
we H
sat O
over O
our H
vermouths N
he O
glorified O
the O
Company's O
Company N
's H
business N
, O
and O
by-and-by O
I H
expressed O
casually O
my H
surprise N
at O
him O
not O
going O
out O
there O
. O

He O
became O
very O
cool O
and O
collected O
all O
at O
once O
. O

I H
am O
not O
such O
a O
fool H
as O
I H
look O
, O
quoth O
Plato H
to O
his O
disciples H
, O
he O
said O
sententiously O
, O
emptied O
his O
glass N
with O
great O
resolution N
, O
and O
we H
rose O
. O

The O
old O
doctor H
felt O
my H
pulse N
, O
evidently O
thinking O
of O
something O
else O
the O
while O
. O

Good O
, O
good O
for O
there O
, O
he O
mumbled O
, O
and O
then O
with O
a O
certain O
eagerness N
asked O
me H
whether O
I H
would O
let O
him O
measure O
my H
head N
. O

Rather O
surprised O
, O
I H
said O
Yes O
, O
when O
he O
produced O
a O
thing N
like O
calipers N
and O
got O
the O
dimensions N
back O
and O
front N
and O
every O
way N
, O
taking O
notes N
carefully O
. O

He O
was O
an O
unshaven O
little O
man H
in O
a O
threadbare O
coat N
like O
a O
gaberdine N
, O
with O
his O
feet N
in O
slippers N
, O
and O
I H
thought O
him O
a O
harmless O
fool H
. O

I H
always O
ask O
leave O
, O
in O
the O
interests N
of O
science N
, O
to O
measure O
the O
crania N
of O
those O
going O
out O
there O
, O
he O
said O
. O

And O
when O
they O
come O
back O
, O
too O
? O
I H
asked O
. O

Oh O
, O
I H
never O
see O
them O
, O
he O
remarked O
; O
' O
and O
, O
moreover O
, O
the O
changes O
take O
place N
inside O
, O
you H
know O
. O

He O
smiled O
, O
as O
if O
at O
some O
quiet O
joke N
. O

So O
you H
are O
going O
out O
there O
. O

Famous O
. O
Interesting O
too O
. O

He O
gave O
me H
a O
searching O
glance N
, O
and O
made O
another O
note O
. O

Ever O
any O
madness N
in O
your H
family N
? O
' O
he O
asked O
, O
in O
a O
matter-of-fact O
tone N
. O

I H
felt O
very O
annoyed O
. O

Is O
that O
question N
in O
the O
interests N
of O
science N
too O
? O

It O
would O
be O
, O
he O
said O
, O
without O
taking O
notice N
of O
my H
irritation N
, O
' O
interesting O
for O
science N
to O
watch O
the O
mental O
changes O
of O
individuals H
, O
on O
the O
spot N
, O
but O
... O

Are O
you H
an O
alienist H
? O
I H
interrupted O
. O

Every O
doctor H
should O
be O
– O
a O
little O
, O
answered O
that O
original N
, O
imperturbably O
. O

' O
I H
have O
a O
little O
theory N
which O
you H
Messieurs H
who O
go O
out O
there O
must O
help O
me H
to O
prove O
. O

This O
is O
my H
share O
in O
the O
advantages N
my H
country N
shall O
reap O
from O
the O
possession N
of O
such O
a O
magnificent O
dependency N
. O

The O
mere O
wealth N
I H
leave O
to O
others O
. O

Pardon O
my H
questions N
, O
but O
you H
are O
the O
first O
Englishman H
coming O
under O
my H
observation N
... O
. O

' O
I H
hastened O
to O
assure O
him O
I H
was O
not O
in O
the O
least O
typical O
. O

If O
I H
were O
, O
said O
I H
, O
I H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
be O
talking O
like O
this O
with O
you H
. O

What O
you H
say O
is O
rather O
profound O
, O
and O
probably O
erroneous O
, O
he O
said O
, O
with O
a O
laugh N
. O

Avoid O
irritation N
more O
than O
exposure N
to O
the O
sun N
. O

Adieu O
. O

How O
do O
you H
English O
say O
, O
eh O
? O
Good-by O
. O

Ah O
! O
Good-by O
. O

Adieu O
. O

In O
the O
tropics N
one O
must O
before O
everything O
keep O
calm N
. O

' O
... O
He O
lifted O
a O
warning N
forefinger N
... O
. O

' O
Du O
calme O
, O
du O
calme O
. O

Adieu O
. O

One O
thing N
more O
remained O
to O
do O
– O
say O
good-by O
to O
my H
excellent O
aunt H
. O

I H
found O
her O
triumphant O
. O

I H
had O
a O
cup N
of O
tea N
– O
the O
last O
decent O
cup N
of O
tea N
for O
many O
days N
– O
and O
in O
a O
room N
that O
most O
soothingly O
looked O
just O
as O
you H
would O
expect O
a O
lady's O
lady H
's H
drawing-room O
to O
look O
, O
we H
had O
a O
long O
quiet O
chat N
by O
the O
fireside N
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
these O
confidences N
it O
became O
quite O
plain O
to O
me H
I H
had O
been O
represented O
to O
the O
wife H
of O
the O
high O
dignitary H
, O
and O
goodness N
knows O
to O
how O
many O
more O
people N
besides O
, O
as O
an O
exceptional O
and O
gifted O
creature A
– O
a O
piece N
of O
good O
fortune N
for O
the O
Company N
– O
a O
man H
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
get O
hold N
of O
every O
day N
. O

Good O
heavens N
! O

and O
I H
was O
going O
to O
take O
charge N
of O
a O
two-penny-halfpenny O
river-steamboat O
with O
a O
penny N
whistle N
attached O
! O

It O
appeared O
, O
however O
, O
I H
was O
also O
one O
of O
the O
Workers H
, O
with O
a O
capital N
– O
you H
know O
. O
Something O
like O
an O
emissary H
of O
light O
, O
something O
like O
a O
lower O
sort N
of O
apostle H
. O

There O
had O
been O
a O
lot N
of O
such O
rot O
let O
loose O
in O
print N
and O
talk O
just O
about O
that O
time N
, O
and O
the O
excellent O
woman H
, O
living O
right O
in O
the O
rush N
of O
all O
that O
humbug N
, O
got O
carried O
off O
her O
feet N
. O

She O
talked O
about O
' O
weaning O
those O
ignorant O
millions N
from O
their O
horrid O
ways N
' O
, O
till O
, O
upon O
my H
word N
, O
she O
made O
me H
quite O
uncomfortable O
. O

Another O
mine H
on O
the O
cliff N
went O
off O
, O
followed O
by O
a O
slight O
shudder N
of O
the O
soil N
under O
my H
feet N
. O

The O
work N
was O
going O
on O
. O

The O
work N
! O

And O
this O
was O
the O
place N
where O
some O
of O
the O
helpers H
had O
withdrawn O
to O
die O
. O

They O
were O
dying O
slowly O
– O
it O
was O
very O
clear O
. O

They O
were O
not O
enemies H
, O
they O
were O
not O
criminals H
, O
they O
were O
nothing O
earthly O
now O
, O
– O
nothing O
but O
black O
shadows N
of O
disease N
and O
starvation N
, O
lying O
confusedly O
in O
the O
greenish O
gloom N
. O

Brought O
from O
all O
the O
recesses N
of O
the O
coast N
in O
all O
the O
legality N
of O
time N
contracts N
, O
lost O
in O
uncongenial O
surroundings O
, O
fed O
on O
unfamiliar O
food N
, O
they O
sickened O
, O
became O
inefficient O
, O
and O
were O
then O
allowed O
to O
crawl O
away O
and O
rest N
. O

These O
moribund O
shapes N
were O
free O
as O
air O
– O
and O
nearly O
as O
thin O
. O

I H
began O
to O
distinguish O
the O
gleam N
of O
eyes N
under O
the O
trees A
. O

Then O
, O
glancing O
down O
, O
I H
saw O
a O
face O
near O
my H
hand N
. O

The O
black O
bones N
reclined O
at O
full O
length N
with O
one O
shoulder N
against O
the O
tree A
, O
and O
slowly O
the O
eyelids N
rose O
and O
the O
sunken O
eyes N
looked O
up O
at O
me H
, O
enormous O
and O
vacant O
, O
a O
kind N
of O
blind O
, O
white O
flicker N
in O
the O
depths N
of O
the O
orbs N
, O
which O
died O
out O
slowly O
. O

The O
man H
seemed O
young O
– O
almost O
a O
boy H
– O
but O
you H
know O
with O
them O
it's O
it O
's H
hard O
to O
tell O
. O

I H
found O
nothing O
else O
to O
do O
but O
to O
offer O
him O
one O
of O
my H
good O
Swede's O
Swede H
's H
ship's O
ship N
's H
biscuits N
I H
had O
in O
my H
pocket N
. O

The O
fingers N
closed O
slowly O
on O
it O
and O
held O
– O
there O
was O
no O
other O
movement N
and O
no O
other O
glance N
. O

He O
had O
tied O
a O
bit N
of O
white O
worsted N
round N
his O
neck N
– O
Why O
? O

Where O
did O
he O
get O
it O
? O

Was O
it O
a O
badge N
– O
an O
ornament N
– O
a O
charm N
– O
a O
propitiatory O
act N
? O

Was O
there O
any O
idea N
at O
all O
connected O
with O
it O
? O

It O
looked O
startling O
round N
his O
black O
neck N
, O
this O
bit N
of O
white O
thread N
from O
beyond O
the O
seas N
. O

Near O
the O
same O
tree A
two O
more O
bundles N
of O
acute O
angles N
sat O
with O
their O
legs N
drawn O
up O
. O

One O
, O
with O
his O
chin N
propped O
on O
his O
knees N
, O
stared O
at O
nothing O
, O
in O
an O
intolerable O
and O
appalling O
manner N
: O
his O
brother H
phantom A
rested O
its O
forehead N
, O
as O
if O
overcome O
with O
a O
great O
weariness N
; O
and O
all O
about O
others O
were O
scattered O
in O
every O
pose N
of O
contorted O
collapse N
, O
as O
in O
some O
picture N
of O
a O
massacre N
or O
a O
pestilence N
. O

While O
I H
stood O
horror-struck O
, O
one O
of O
these O
creatures A
rose O
to O
his O
hands N
and O
knees N
, O
and O
went O
off O
on O
all-fours O
towards O
the O
river N
to O
drink O
. O

He O
lapped O
out O
of O
his O
hand N
, O
then O
sat O
up O
in O
the O
sunlight N
, O
crossing O
his O
shins N
in O
front N
of O
him O
, O
and O
after O
a O
time N
let O
his O
woolly O
head N
fall O
on O
his O
breastbone N
. O

I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
want O
any O
more O
loitering O
in O
the O
shade N
, O
and O
I H
made O
haste N
towards O
the O
station N
. O

When O
near O
the O
buildings N
I H
met O
a O
white O
man H
, O
in O
such O
an O
unexpected O
elegance N
of O
get-up O
that O
in O
the O
first O
moment N
I H
took O
him O
for O
a O
sort N
of O
vision N
. O

I H
saw O
a O
high O
starched O
collar N
, O
white O
cuffs N
, O
a O
light O
alpaca N
jacket N
, O
snowy O
trousers N
, O
a O
clear O
necktie N
, O
and O
varnished O
boots N
. O
No O
hat N
. O

Hair N
parted O
, O
brushed O
, O
oiled O
, O
under O
a O
green-lined O
parasol N
held O
in O
a O
big O
white O
hand N
. O

He O
was O
amazing O
, O
and O
had O
a O
penholder O
behind O
his O
ear N
. O

I H
shook O
hands N
with O
this O
miracle N
, O
and O
I H
learned O
he O
was O
the O
Company's O
Company N
's H
chief O
accountant H
, O
and O
that O
all O
the O
bookkeeping N
was O
done O
at O
this O
station N
. O

He O
had O
come O
out O
for O
a O
moment N
, O
he O
said O
, O
' O
to O
get O
a O
breath N
of O
fresh O
air O
. O
' O

The O
expression N
sounded O
wonderfully O
odd O
, O
with O
its O
suggestion N
of O
sedentary O
desk-life O
. O

I H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
have O
mentioned O
the O
fellow H
to O
you H
at O
all O
, O
only O
it O
was O
from O
his O
lips N
that O
I H
first O
heard O
the O
name N
of O
the O
man H
who O
is O
so O
indissolubly O
connected O
with O
the O
memories N
of O
that O
time N
. O

Moreover O
, O
I H
respected O
the O
fellow H
. O

Yes O
; O
I H
respected O
his O
collars N
, O
his O
vast O
cuffs N
, O
his O
brushed O
hair N
. O

His O
appearance N
was O
certainly O
that O
of O
a O
hairdresser's O
hairdresser H
's H
dummy H
; O
but O
in O
the O
great O
demoralization N
of O
the O
land O
he O
kept O
up O
his O
appearance N
. O

That's O
That O
's H
backbone N
. O

His O
starched O
collars N
and O
got-up O
shirt-fronts O
were O
achievements N
of O
character N
. O

He O
had O
been O
out O
nearly O
three O
years N
; O
and O
, O
later O
on O
, O
I H
could O
not O
help O
asking O
him O
how O
he O
managed O
to O
sport O
such O
linen N
. O

He O
had O
just O
the O
faintest O
blush N
, O
and O
said O
modestly O
, O
I've O
I H
've O
been O
teaching O
one O
of O
the O
native O
women H
about O
the O
station N
. O

It O
was O
difficult O
. O
She O
had O
a O
distaste N
for O
the O
work N
. O

This O
man H
had O
verily O
accomplished O
something O
. O

And O
he O
was O
devoted O
to O
his O
books N
, O
which O
were O
in O
apple-pie O
order N
. O

Everything O
else O
in O
the O
station N
was O
in O
a O
muddle N
, O
– O
heads N
, O
things N
, O
buildings N
. O

Strings N
of O
dusty O
niggers H
with O
splay O
feet N
arrived O
and O
departed O
; O
a O
stream N
of O
manufactured O
goods N
, O
rubbishy O
cottons N
, O
beads N
, O
and O
brass-wire O
set O
into O
the O
depths N
of O
darkness N
, O
and O
in O
return N
came O
a O
precious O
trickle N
of O
ivory N
. O

I H
had O
to O
wait O
in O
the O
station N
for O
ten O
days N
– O
an O
eternity N
. O

I H
lived O
in O
a O
hut N
in O
the O
yard N
, O
but O
to O
be O
out O
of O
the O
chaos N
I H
would O
sometimes O
get O
into O
the O
accountant's O
accountant H
's H
office N
. O

It O
was O
built O
of O
horizontal O
planks N
, O
and O
so O
badly O
put O
together O
that O
, O
as O
he O
bent O
over O
his O
high O
desk N
, O
he O
was O
barred O
from O
neck N
to O
heels N
with O
narrow O
strips N
of O
sunlight N
. O

There O
was O
no O
need O
to O
open O
the O
big O
shutter N
to O
see O
. O

It O
was O
hot O
there O
too O
; O
big O
flies A
buzzed O
fiendishly O
, O
and O
did O
not O
sting O
, O
but O
stabbed O
. O

I H
sat O
generally O
on O
the O
floor N
, O
while O
, O
of O
faultless O
appearance N
( O
and O
even O
slightly O
scented O
) O
, O
perching O
on O
a O
high O
stool N
, O
he O
wrote O
, O
he O
wrote O
. O

Sometimes O
he O
stood O
up O
for O
exercise N
. O

When O
a O
truckle-bed O
with O
a O
sick O
man H
( O
some O
invalided O
agent H
from O
up-country O
) O
was O
put O
in O
there O
, O
he O
exhibited O
a O
gentle O
annoyance N
. O

The O
groans N
of O
this O
sick O
person H
, O
he O
said O
, O
distract O
my H
attention N
. O

And O
without O
that O
it O
is O
extremely O
difficult O
to O
guard O
against O
clerical O
errors N
in O
this O
climate N
. O

One O
day N
he O
remarked O
, O
without O
lifting O
his O
head N
, O
' O
In O
the O
interior N
you H
will O
no O
doubt N
meet O
Mr. N
Kurtz O
. O
' O

On O
my H
asking O
who O
Mr. N
Kurtz O
was O
, O
he O
said O
he O
was O
a O
first-class O
agent H
; O
and O
seeing O
my H
disappointment N
at O
this O
information N
, O
he O
added O
slowly O
, O
laying O
down O
his O
pen N
, O
' O
He O
is O
a O
very O
remarkable O
person H
. O
' O

Further O
questions N
elicited O
from O
him O
that O
Mr. N
Kurtz O
was O
at O
present O
in O
charge N
of O
a O
trading O
post N
, O
a O
very O
important O
one O
, O
in O
the O
true O
ivory-country O
, O
at O
' O
the O
very O
bottom O
of O
there O
. O

Sends O
in O
as O
much O
ivory N
as O
all O
the O
others O
put O
together O
... O
. O

He O
began O
to O
write O
again O
. O

The O
sick O
man H
was O
too O
ill O
to O
groan O
. O

The O
flies A
buzzed O
in O
a O
great O
peace N
. O

Suddenly O
there O
was O
a O
growing O
murmur N
of O
voices N
and O
a O
great O
tramping O
of O
feet N
. O

Fourthly O
, O
do O
not O
say O
we H
were O
not O
available O
! O

It O
would O
certainly O
be O
counterproductive O
to O
make O
an O
offer O
, O
as O
some O
have O
already O
tried O
, O
when O
the O
Russians H
want O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
it O
. O

In O
our H
proposals N
in O
relation N
to O
Agenda N
2000 O
we H
considered O
the O
probable O
future N
trend N
of O
competition N
between O
pigmeat O
and O
beef A
. O

Should O
we H
find O
at O
any O
point N
that O
this O
is O
not O
the O
case N
, O
we H
will O
take O
the O
appropriate O
steps N
. O

I H
must O
admit O
I H
see O
the O
question N
of O
a O
world N
market N
orientation N
rather O
differently O
from O
the O
way N
it O
was O
presented O
a O
moment N
ago O
. O

Joint O
motion N
for O
a O
resolution N
on O
the O
crisis N
in O
the O
pigmeat O
sector N

We H
favour N
a O
reform N
involving O
the O
alignment N
of O
prices N
to O
world N
market N
prices N
and O
a O
reduction N
in O
export N
refunds N
. O

Finally O
, O
I H
should O
like O
to O
point N
out O
here O
the O
significance N
of O
a O
proposal N
put O
forward O
by O
our H
colleague H
Edouard O
des O
Places H
. O

I H
see O
this O
proposal N
as O
establishing O
some O
sort N
of O
precedent N
. O

It O
was O
quite O
a O
poignant O
fact N
that O
I H
was O
away O
on O
that O
particular O
Friday N
. O

We H
need O
foreign O
investors H
in O
places N
such O
as O
Telford O
, O
north O
Shropshire O
, O
Hereford O
, O
Ross-on-Wye O
and O
Wyre O
Forest O
. O

I H
would O
certainly O
not O
want O
farmers H
in O
countries N
that O
do O
not O
want O
to O
join O
the O
euro N
to O
be O
penalised O
. O

The O
2.6 O
-% O
margin N
of O
fluctuation N
is O
nothing O
new O
; O
it O
already O
exists O
within O
the O
present O
system N
and O
is O
already O
being O
applied O
. O

The O
flat-rate O
approach N
produces O
more O
risk N
of O
overcompensation N
, O
which O
is O
why O
we H
have O
set O
the O
margin N
at O
2.6 O
-% O
. O

A O
strong O
euro N
will O
therefore O
penalise O
European O
agricultural O
exports N
. O

Under O
these O
conditions N
, O
what O
will O
the O
future N
of O
the O
rural O
areas N
of O
Europe O
be O
like O
as O
a O
consequence N
? O

We H
in O
the O
Committee N
on O
Agriculture N
and O
Rural O
Development N
feel O
that O
this O
form N
of O
production N
should O
be O
encouraged O
. O

Too O
little O
is O
being O
done O
in O
this O
area N
. O
More O
needs O
to O
be O
done O
, O
but O
we H
must O
avoid O
creating O
more O
bureaucracy N
. O

I H
have O
nothing O
against O
putting O
quality N
goods N
on O
the O
world N
market N
when O
it O
is O
a O
matter N
of O
competition N
. O

Firstly O
, O
it O
proposes O
the O
adoption N
of O
a O
regulation N
improving O
the O
transparency N
and O
authenticity N
of O
quality N
marks N
. O

It O
then O
proposes O
the O
creation N
of O
a O
European O
quality N
mark N
based O
on O
respect N
for O
the O
environmental O
criteria O
for O
production N
. O

The O
market N
in O
agricultural O
products N
is O
therefore O
no O
longer O
linked O
exclusively O
to O
price N
, O
but O
to O
the O
region N
. O

We H
in O
Parliament N
would O
like O
to O
add O
a O
third O
category N
covering O
organic O
products N
that O
also O
comply O
with O
environmental O
and O
animal A
protection N
criteria O
. O

I H
was O
recently O
in O
Poland O
for O
the O
Joint O
Parliamentary O
Committee N
. O

But O
that O
is O
precisely O
why O
we H
first O
need O
a O
clear O
strategy N
. O

At O
this O
stage N
, O
it O
still O
seems O
a O
little O
too O
soon O
to O
take O
a O
final O
position N
on O
this O
question N
. O

We H
support N
the O
introduction N
of O
a O
European O
quality N
mark N
, O
which O
takes O
account N
of O
animal A
welfare N
and O
the O
environment N
. O

Secondly O
, O
we H
can O
not O
support N
proposals N
for O
the O
split O
in O
funding N
or O
criteria O
in O
relation N
to O
the O
new O
Structural O
Fund N
regulation N
. O

We H
welcome O
the O
introduction N
of O
conditional O
clauses N
for O
the O
second O
payment N
. O

The O
results N
of O
the O
fourth O
phase N
of O
the O
Objective N
2 O
programme O
, O
whose O
priority N
is O
job N
creation N
, O
are O
relatively O
pleasing O
. O

Thank O
you H
, O
Mr N
Donnay O
. O

Mr N
Escola O
Hernando O
is O
speaking O
for O
the O
first O
time N
in O
this O
House N
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
I H
should O
merely O
like O
to O
answer O
Mr N
Kellett-Bowman O
in O
one O
sentence N
. O

The O
Chair H
has O
already O
stated O
that O
the O
proposal N
was O
made O
in O
accordance N
with O
the O
Rules N
, O
so O
there O
are O
no O
grounds N
for O
changing O
anything O
. O

Our H
group N
has O
tabled O
several O
amendments N
in O
this O
direction N
. O

The O
programme O
has O
also O
contributed O
to O
the O
activities N
of O
50000 O
creative O
or O
performing O
artists H
and O
other O
specialists H
in O
the O
cultural O
sector N
. O

The O
decisions N
were O
adopted O
unanimously O
. O

The O
joint N
debate N
is O
closed O
. O

That O
concludes O
Parliament's O
Parliament N
's H
agenda N
. O

Adjournment N
of O
the O
session N

Yesterday N
it O
was O
my H
privilege N
and O
pleasure N
to O
be O
permitted O
two O
minutes N
' O
speaking O
time N
in O
this O
House N
. O

It O
was O
obviously O
out O
of O
excitement N
at O
this O
great O
event N
that O
I H
forgot O
to O
sign O
the O
register N
. O

Ladies H
and O
gentlemen H
, O
it O
is O
a O
good O
thing N
that O
the O
details N
of O
Members H
' O
attendance N
are O
corrected O
. O

That O
is O
wrong O
. O

This O
item N
has O
been O
correctly O
placed O
on O
the O
agenda N
and O
will O
be O
put O
to O
the O
vote N
at O
12 O
noon N
today N
. O

The O
deadline N
expires O
today N
, O
so O
if O
we H
do O
not O
vote N
, O
we H
shall O
miss O
the O
opportunity N
to O
deliver O
our H
opinion N
. O

Preparing O
a O
Union-wide O
harmonising O
directive N
on O
as O
complex O
a O
matter N
as O
energy N
is O
certainly O
a O
complicated O
business N
. O

I H
believe O
that O
the O
Commission's O
Commission N
's H
initial O
approach N
was O
wise O
, O
because O
the O
problem N
calls O
for O
countless O
exceptions N
to O
the O
general O
rule N
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
our H
colleague H
, O
Mr N
Cox H
, O
has O
done O
some O
excellent O
work N
on O
the O
Commission's O
Commission N
's H
proposal N
. O

The O
Green O
Group N
fully O
agrees O
with O
Mr N
Spencer H
that O
we H
must O
preserve O
this O
proposal N
for O
a O
CO2 N
tax N
. O

The O
taxes N
will O
end N
up O
in O
the O
German O
Treasury N
instead O
of O
the O
Danish O
Treasury N
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
I H
should O
like O
to O
take O
up O
two O
points N
which O
are O
mentioned O
in O
the O
Environment N
Committee's O
Committee N
's H
report N
. O

I H
should O
also O
like O
to O
know O
how O
you H
view O
the O
timing N
. O

This O
is O
legislation N
requiring O
a O
unanimous O
vote N
in O
the O
Council N
, O
which O
is O
usually O
a O
guarantee N
of O
inaction N
. O

This O
indexing O
also O
includes O
the O
notion N
of O
an O
accelerator N
. O

In O
other O
words N
, O
there O
is O
a O
conflict N
between O
the O
parafiscal O
and O
fiscal O
aims O
; O
you H
can O
not O
have O
your H
cake N
and O
eat O
it O
. O

That O
technological O
effort N
would O
be O
penalised O
and O
competitiveness N
on O
the O
international O
field O
jeopardised O
. O

In O
light O
of O
this O
situation N
, O
we H
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
accept O
a O
number N
of O
unilateral O
proposals N
that O
were O
put O
forward O
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
unacceptable O
to O
compel O
the O
Member H
States N
to O
apply O
increases N
that O
are O
actually O
above O
the O
rate N
of O
inflation N
. O

You H
can O
regulate O
the O
market N
, O
but O
you H
can O
not O
regulate O
nature N
, O
the O
weather N
and O
the O
harvest N
. O

In O
one O
amendment N
, O
there O
is O
a O
call O
for O
the O
inclusion N
of O
pure O
and O
simple O
renewal N
of O
vineyards N
in O
the O
restructuring O
measures N
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
we H
want O
to O
limit O
the O
Council N
regulations N
to O
general O
provisions N
and O
to O
cover O
the O
remaining O
provisions N
in O
implementing O
regulations N
. O

Everyone O
will O
therefore O
understand O
why O
I H
am O
rejecting O
them O
. O

I H
would O
like O
to O
start N
with O
the O
Convention N
on O
third-country O
nationals H
, O
which O
is O
certainly O
the O
more O
complex O
legislative O
project N
. O

The O
mere O
offer O
of O
a O
job N
was O
to O
be O
sufficient O
to O
justify O
immigration N
rights N
. O

They O
have O
not O
all O
been O
met O
, O
but O
a O
great O
many O
have O
. O

Secondly O
, O
I H
believe O
that O
it O
is O
time N
for O
the O
European O
Parliament N
to O
set O
an O
example N
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand N
, O
these O
initial O
criteria O
should O
also O
include O
provisions N
allowing O
for O
the O
list O
to O
be O
abolished O
. O

Such O
a O
situation N
is O
unacceptable O
. O

I H
am O
all O
for O
thought O
being O
given O
to O
this O
and O
for O
seeking O
solutions N
. O

We H
must O
help O
them O
to O
improve O
their O
border N
security N
. O

It O
is O
the O
whole O
political O
class N
that O
is O
being O
questioned O
about O
the O
way N
in O
which O
it O
must O
take O
up O
these O
challenges N
. O

Finally O
, O
I H
should O
like O
to O
say O
that O
the O
policies N
at O
the O
centre N
of O
our H
debate N
are O
part N
of O
an O
overall O
picture N
. O

I H
would O
also O
like O
to O
say O
something O
about O
the O
two O
amendments N
tabled O
by O
my H
group N
. O

We H
want O
things N
to O
be O
regulated O
properly O
so O
that O
the O
problem N
can O
be O
brought O
under O
control N
. O

He O
has O
consistently O
linked O
immigration N
with O
unemployment N
, O
insecurity N
and O
criminality N
, O
as O
if O
evil N
always O
comes O
from O
elsewhere O
. O

I H
would O
really O
like O
to O
know O
how O
you H
can O
escape O
into O
Europe O
. O

We H
have O
been O
discussing O
this O
subject N
ever O
since O
I H
have O
been O
in O
Parliament N
. O

I H
hope O
they O
will O
be O
rejected O
because O
they O
are O
really O
the O
epitome N
of O
what O
Parliament N
is O
not O
able O
to O
do O
. O

Consequently O
, O
I H
had O
hoped O
to O
be O
able O
to O
count O
on O
a O
clear O
expression N
of O
support N
from O
the O
European O
Parliament N
. O

Naturally O
the O
Commission N
will O
do O
its O
best O
to O
ensure O
that O
progress N
is O
made O
. O

The O
regulation N
that O
was O
annulled O
was O
based O
on O
Article N
100c O
of O
the O
Maastricht O
Treaty N
. O

The O
debate N
is O
closed O
. O

I H
thought O
it O
appropriate O
to O
retable O
at O
second O
reading N
three O
of O
the O
12 O
amendments N
rejected O
by O
the O
Council N
. O

I H
have O
to O
admit O
that O
I H
had O
serious O
misgivings N
during O
the O
first O
reading N
of O
the O
directive N
. O

Perhaps O
we H
are O
only O
further O
complicating O
a O
matter N
which O
should O
really O
have O
left O
Parliament N
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
once O
a O
decision N
had O
been O
reached O
. O

Chemicals N
are O
still O
on O
our H
agenda N
in O
the O
EU O
. O

There O
has O
been O
excellent O
cooperation N
on O
this O
highly O
technical O
proposal N
. O

Thank O
goodness N
we H
have O
finally O
reached O
the O
last O
stage N
before O
adoption N
. O

Parliament N
agreed O
to O
urgent O
procedure N
for O
22 O
March O

Amendment N
of O
the O
Rules N
of O
Procedure N

They O
leave O
space N
and O
gaps N
to O
fill O
in O
. O

This O
new O
legally O
binding O
vote N
is O
highlighted O
in O
the O
revision N
of O
the O
Rules N
by O
describing O
it O
as O
the O
election N
of O
the O
Commission N
. O

They O
include O
provisions N
for O
dealing O
with O
the O
new O
High O
Representative H
for O
the O
Common O
Foreign O
and O
Security N
Policy N
. O

I H
shall O
not O
go O
into O
details N
on O
the O
High O
Representative H
, O
as O
his O
or O
her O
function N
has O
already O
been O
extensively O
debated O
. O

Finally O
, O
now O
that O
I H
am O
discussing O
resources N
, O
new O
technologies N
and O
speaking O
time N
, O
my H
own O
speaking O
time N
has O
elapsed O
. O

The O
second O
part N
makes O
it O
clear O
that O
benefits N
of O
a O
value N
greater O
than O
ECU O
100 O
must O
be O
declared O
. O

The O
report N
is O
also O
imprudent O
in O
introducing O
issues N
not O
included O
in O
the O
mandate N
given O
by O
the O
Conference N
of O
Presidents H
. O

The O
opinion N
must O
be O
expressed O
when O
the O
vote N
on O
the O
full O
text N
is O
taken O
in O
committee N
. O

But O
that O
is O
not O
really O
my H
problem N
. O

What O
I H
criticise O
is O
the O
spirit N
underlying O
these O
amendments N
. O

This O
is O
the O
last O
rule N
in O
our H
Rules N
of O
Procedure N
and O
it O
concerns O
the O
annexes N
. O

Let O
me H
begin O
by O
saying O
that O
I H
do O
not O
intend O
to O
talk O
about O
my H
own O
report N
. O

Notwithstanding O
this O
, O
we H
shall O
certainly O
consider O
the O
suggestions N
put O
forward O
by O
the O
Socialist O
Group N
. O

The O
first O
concerns O
the O
proposal N
that O
would O
prevent O
political O
groups N
being O
formed O
of O
Members H
from O
one O
country N
only O
. O

The O
second O
issue N
is O
that O
of O
incentives N
. O

I H
believe O
it O
is O
workable O
, O
though O
it O
may N
be O
somewhat O
complicated O
. O

I H
am O
no O
fanatical O
defender H
of O
profits N
for O
pharmaceutical O
industry N
multinationals O
. O

We H
support N
Professor H
Cabrol's O
Cabrol O
's H
attempt N
to O
get O
things N
moving O
and O
put O
the O
uncertainties N
behind O
us H
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
ladies H
and O
gentlemen H
, O
the O
present O
proposal N
for O
a O
regulation N
is O
certainly O
to O
be O
welcomed O
. O

of O
course O
we H
can O
do O
so O
directly O
through O
support N
for O
research N
, O
and O
we H
shall O
continue O
to O
do O
so O
in O
future N
. O

But O
we H
also O
want O
to O
create O
a O
range N
of O
additional O
incentives N
, O
for O
instance N
through O
the O
ten-year O
market N
exclusivity O
right O
. O

The O
Member H
States N
would O
have O
to O
do O
so O
. O

I H
am O
very O
glad O
that O
some O
Members H
also O
spoke O
in O
favour N
of O
a O
special O
committee N
, O
during O
the O
debate N
. O

But O
then O
you H
must O
remember O
the O
aim N
of O
our H
proposal N
. O

That O
is O
why O
we H
want O
to O
support N
research N
rather O
than O
make O
it O
more O
difficult O
. O

We H
believe O
that O
is O
a O
risk N
we H
should O
not O
necessarily O
take O
on O
. O

For O
by O
definition N
an O
orphan H
drug N
is O
precisely O
a O
drug N
that O
offers O
very O
limited O
prospects N
of O
making O
a O
profit N
. O

The O
stale O
cool O
air O
of O
the O
room N
had O
heated O
; O
yet O
weariness N
receded O
, O
his O
head N
was O
left O
high O
and O
dry O
of O
it O
. O

There O
was O
silence N
and O
then O
he O
heard O
that O
there O
were O
voices N
in O
the O
silence N
droning O
somewhere O
, O
breaking O
off O
for O
breath N
, O
laughing O
– O
not O
softly O
, O
but O
softened O
by O
being O
almost O
out O
of O
earshot N
. O

not O
quite O
. O

A O
voice N
separated O
, O
wound O
nearer O
, O
there O
was O
the O
starting O
up O
of O
a O
hiss N
( O
a O
hose N
, O
he O
thought O
) O
and O
he O
made O
out O
a O
word N
: O
not O
just O
as O
a O
particular O
combination N
of O
articulated O
sounds N
, O
but O
a O
meaning N
: O

the O
compound N
word N
for O
this O
phrase N
, O
in O
the O
language N
that O
was O
spoken O
round N
the O
capital N
, O
and O
that O
he O
had O
never O
really O
known O
well O
. O

He O
got O
up O
and O
went O
over O
to O
the O
main O
house N
for O
a O
bath N
. O

The O
sun N
in O
the O
garden N
was O
burning O
, O
dazzling O
, O
seizing O
. O

In O
the O
bathroom N
flies A
were O
buzzing O
themselves O
to O
death N
against O
the O
windowpanes N
. O

Roly O
was O
a O
bachelor H
and O
his O
house N
was O
the O
particular O
mixture N
of O
tranquil O
luxury N
and O
unchangeable O
dreariness N
that O
is O
a O
condition N
of O
households N
where O
white O
men H
live O
indulged O
in O
the O
sole O
charge N
of O
black O
male H
servants H
. O

The O
cistern N
of O
the O
lavatory N
drizzled O
into O
the O
pan O
constantly O
and O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
be O
flushed O
properly O
, O
and O
the O
towels N
were O
stiff O
as O
a O
dress-shirt O
( O
Olivia H
had O
taken O
years N
to O
get O
people N
to O
learn O
to O
rinse O
the O
soap N
out O
of O
the O
washing N
) O
, O
but O
an O
old O
fellow H
in O
a O
cook's O
cook H
's H
hat N
put O
tea N
under O
the O
trees A
for O
him O
and O
carried O
off O
his O
crumpled O
suit N
to O
be O
pressed O
without O
being O
asked O

A O
youth H
was O
cutting O
the O
tough O
grass A
with O
a O
length N
of O
iron N
bent O
at O
the O
end N
. O

Coarse O
and O
florid O
shrubs A
, O
hibiscus A
with O
its O
big O
flowers N
sluttish O
with O
pollen N
and O
ants A
and O
poinsettia A
oozing O
milky O
secretion N
, O
bloomed O
giving O
a O
show O
of O
fecundity N
to O
the O
red O
, O
poor O
soil N
running O
baked O
bald O
under O
the O
grass A
, O
beaten O
slimy O
by O
the O
rains N
under O
the O
trees A
, O
and O
friable O
only O
where O
ants A
had O
digested O
it O
and O
made O
little O
crusty O
tunnels N
. O

A O
rich O
stink N
of O
dead O
animal A
rose O
self-dispersed O
, O
like O
a O
gas N
, O
every O
now O
and O
then O
as O
he O
drank O
his O
tea N
, O
and O
he O
got O
up O
and O
looked O
around O
, O
as O
he O
had O
done O
so O
many O
times N
before O
, O
and O
with O
as O
little O
success N
, O
to O
see O
if O
a O
rat A
or O
mole N
were O
rotting N
somewhere O
. O

Whatever O
it O
was O
could O
never O
be O
found O
; O
it O
was O
the O
smell N
of O
growth N
, O
they O
had O
long O
ago O
decided O
, O
at O
Gala N
, O
the O
process N
of O
decay N
and O
regeneration N
so O
accelerated O
, O
brought O
so O
close O
together O
that O
it O
produced O
the O
reek N
of O
death-and-life O
, O
all O
at O
once O
. O

He O
strolled O
to O
the O
limits N
of O
the O
garden N
and O
climbed O
through O
the O
barbed-wire O
fence N
, O
but O
the O
grasses A
and O
thornbush O
on O
the O
other O
side N
( O
Dando's O
Dando O
's H
place N
was O
eight O
miles N
out O
of O
town N
) O
were O
too O
entangled O
for O
walking O
where O
there O
was O
no O
path N
. O

He O
listened O
to O
the O
bush A
and O
had O
the O
old O
feeling N
, O
in O
the O
bush A
, O
of O
being O
listened O
for O
. O

There O
were O
– O
or O
used O
to O
be O
– O
leopards N
on O
the O
outskirts N
of O
the O
town N
; O
Dando O
had O
once O
had O
his O
dog A
taken O
. O

He O
walked O
a O
hundred O
yards N
or O
so O
up O
the O
road N
, O
and O
, O
meeting O
a O
man H
on O
a O
bicycle N
, O
greeted O
him O
in O
the O
language N
that O
had O
come O
back O
to O
him O
as O
he O
lay O
in O
the O
room N
. O

At O
six O
Roland H
Dando O
came O
home N
. O

He O
gazed O
anxiously O
from O
the O
car N
as O
if O
, O
despite O
the O
telephone N
call O
, O
he O
were O
not O
sure O
if O
Bray H
had O
been O
safely O
received O
, O
but O
once O
he O
set O
eyes N
on O
him O
behaved O
as O
if O
they O
had O
seen O
each O
other O
a O
week N
ago O
. O

He O
was O
indiscreet O
, O
like O
many O
people N
who O
live O
alone O
, O
and O
brought O
back O
with O
him O
from O
the O
town N
– O
a O
child H
bulging O
with O
favours N
from O
a O
party N
– O
all O
the O
anecdotes N
and O
gossip N
of O
the O
Independence N
celebrations N
, O
producing O
, O
in O
a O
clinging O
fluff N
of O
supposition N
and O
rumour N
, O
bits N
and O
pieces N
of O
real O
information N
and O
opinion N
about O
Mweta's O
Mweta O
's H
position N
and O
the O
sort N
of O
team A
he O
had O
gathered O
around O
him O
. O

Another O
tray N
came O
out O
under O
the O
trees A
, O
this O
time N
with O
whisky N
and O
gin N
. O

An O
old O
black O
Labrador N
with O
corns A
on O
his O
elbows N
stood O
slowly O
swinging O
his O
tail N
before O
Dando O
as O
he O
talked O
. O

burst O
them O
under O
his O
shoe N
while O
he O
drank O

dealt O
out O

Out O
of O
a O
kind N
of O
jealousy N
of O
the O
new O
young O
men H
from O
Britain O

who O
were O
so O
careful O

their O
lack N

colour-feeling O
by O
avoiding O
tainted O
words N
and O
addressing O
people N

ecklessly O

Edward H
Shinza's O
Shinza O
's H
one O
of O
the O
few O
who O
did O
his O
stretch N
and O
got O
his O
head N
split O
open O
that O
time N

Her O
Majesty's O
Majesty N

brave O
boys H
, O
and O
where's O
where O
's H
he O
... O
back O
in O
the O
Bashi O
Flats N
among O
his O
old O
wives H
, O
for O
all O
I H
know O
, O
no O
one O
even O
mentions O
his O
name N
. O

But O
Shinza's O
Shinza O
's H
here O
for O
the O
Independence N
ceremony N
? O

Roly O
glared O
. O

Nobody O
gives O
a O
damn O
where O
he O
is O
. O

But O
he O
is O
in O
town N
, O
now O
? O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
the O
hell N
he O
may N
be O
. O

You H
mean O
Edward's O
Edward H
's H
not O
going O
to O
take O
part N
in O
the O
celebrations N
? O

That's O
That O
's H
not O
possible O
. O

He's O
He O
's H
not O
come O
up O
to O
town N
? O

You H
can O
see O
he O
hasn't O
has O
n't O
been O
given O
a O
cabinet N
post N
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
suppose O
he's O
he O
's H
going O
to O
turn O
up O
for O
the O
honour N
of O
standing N
in O
the O
crowd N
and O
waving O
a O
flag N
, O
eh O
? O

But O
that's O
that O
's H
ridiculous O
, O
Roly O
. O

You H
know O
Shinza O
. O

He O
knows O
what O
he O
wants O
. O

I H
had O
the O
impression N
he'll O
he O
'll O
be O
ambassador H
to O
U.N. O

Give O
time N
for O
Mweta O
to O
shine O
on O
his O
own O
for O
a O
bit N
, O
and O
any O
tension N
between O
them O
to O
die O
down O
. O

Of O
course O
he O
should O
have O
got O
Foreign O
Affairs N
. O

But O
that's O
that O
's H
between O
the O
two O
of O
them O
. O

You H
might O
ask O
Mweta O
, O
if O
you H
get O
a O
chance N
to O
talk O
to O
him O
, O
ask O
him O
if O
he O
isn't O
is O
n't O
going O
to O
find O
a O
piddling O
little O
job N
somewhere O
, O
something O
with O
a O
decent O
label N
to O
it O
, O
for O
poor O
old O
Shinza O
, O
he O
was O
banging O
on O
the O
Colonial O
Secretary's O
Secretary H
's H
door N
with O
a O
panga N
while O
Mweta O
was O
a O
snotty O
picannin O
singing O
hymns N
up O
at O
the O
mission N
school N
. O

Dando O
glowered O
pettishly O
over O
his O
third O
or O
fourth O
gin N
and O
ginger A
beer N
. O

He O
was O
given O
to O
putting O
himself O
on O
strange O
mixtures N
. O

He O
would O
drink O
one O
for O
several O
months N
and O
then O
switch O
, O
for O
similar O
good O
reasons N
( O
it O
was O
more O
digestible O
, O
it O
was O
less O
likely O
to O
produce N
an O
after-thirst O
) O
to O
another O
. O

Oh O
Mweta's O
Mweta O
's H
not O
like O
that O
. O

You H
know O
Mweta O
. O

I H
know O
Mweta O
. O

But O
there's O
there O
's H
the O
President H
, O
now O
. O

If O
there's O
there O
's H
a O
father H
of O
the O
state N
, O
it's O
it O
's H
got O
to O
be O
him O
or O
no O
one O
. O

I H
certainly O
had O
the O
impression N
whatever O
tension N
there O
was O
had O
eased O
up O
, O
last O
time N
I H
saw O
Mweta O
in O
London O
. O

Yes O
, O
poor O
old O
Shinza O
, O
that's O
that O
's H
what O
everyone O
says N
. O

Poor O
old O
Dando O
. O

Dando O
did O
not O
explain O
the O
shift N
of O
reference N
. O

Perhaps O
he O
simply O
remarked O
upon O
his O
own O
getting O
older O
; O

undoubtedly O
he O
looked O
older O
. O

His O
small O
nose N
showed O
unexpectedly O
beaky O
now O
that O
the O
skin N
had O
sunk O
on O
either O
side N
. O

Bray H
had O
a O
lot N
of O
questions N
, O
not O
all O
of O
them O
kind N
, O
to O
ask O
about O
other O
people N
. O

Some O
of O
the O
answers N
were O
extraordinary O
; O

the O
two O
men H
quickened O
to O
the O
exchange N
of O
astonishment N
, O
ironic O
amusement N
, O
and O
( O
on O
Dando's O
Dando O
's H
part N
) O
scornful O
indignation N
with O
which O
he O
told O
and O
Bray H
learned O
of O
the O
swift O
about-face N
by O
which O
some O
white O
people N
turned O
a O
smile N
on O
the O
new O
regime N
, O
while O
others O
had O
already O
packed O
up O
and O
left O
the O
country N
. O

Sir O
Reginald H
himself O
will O
present O
Mweta O
with O
a O
buta-wood O
lectern N
and O
silver N
inkstand N
, O
it's O
it O
's H
down O
for O
Tuesday N
afternoon N
. O

Dando O
was O
gleeful O
. O

Sir O
Reginald H
Harvey H
was O
president H
of O
the O
consortium N
of O
the O
three O
mining O
concessionaire H
companies N
, O
and O
it O
was O
common O
knowledge N
that O
, O
as O
a O
personal O
friend H
of O
Redvers O
Ledley O
, O
the O
most O
unpopular O
governor H
the O
territory N
had O
ever O
had O
, O
he O
had O
influenced O
the O
governor H
to O
outlaw O
the O
miners H
' O
union N
at O
a O
time N
when O
Mweta O
and O
Shinza O
were O
using O
it O
to O
promote O
the O
independence N
movement N
. O

There O
was O
a O
famous O
newspaper N
interview N
where O
he O
had O
called O
Mweta O
that O
golliwog N
from O
Gala N
, O
raising O
its O
unruly O
and O
misguided O
head N
in O
the O
nursery N
of O
industrial O
relations N
in O
this O
young O
country N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
enough O
to O
make O
your H
hair N
stand O
on O
end N
, O
said O
Dando O
; O
and O
enjoyed O
the O
effect N
. O

The O
People's O
People N
's H
Independence N
Party N
, O
at O
the O
time N
, O
had O
taken O
Harvey's O
Harvey H
's H
remark N
as O
an O
insulting O
reference N
to O
Mweta's O
Mweta O
's H
hair N
; O
he O
still O
had O
it O
all O
, O
and O
it O
certainly O
would O
be O
in O
evidence N
on O
Tuesday N
. O

Bray H
repeated O
what O
had O
been O
said O
to O
him O
at O
the O
airport N
that O
morning N
– O
that O
some O
of O
the O
white O
people N
still O
living O
in O
the O
capital N
would O
be O
more O
at O
home N
down O
South O
, O
in O
Rhodesia O
or O
South O
Africa O
. O

Ras O
Asahe O
meant O
the O
whites H
– O

all O
know O
that O
after O
the O
end N
of O
the O
year N
they'll O
they O
'll O
be O
on O
contract N
, O
and O
that O
means O
they'll O
they O
'll O
be O
replaced O
in O
three O
years N
. O

not O
that O
they O
ever O
made O
an O
effort N
. O

Sheltered O
employment N
all O
these O
years N
, O
what O
d' O
you H
expect O
? O

You H
don't O
do O
n't O
need O
ideas N
, O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
move O
out O
of O
your H
chair N
, O
you H
simply O
go O
on O
producing O
a O
noise N
out O
of O
the O
magic N
box N
to O
keep O
the O
natives H
quiet O
– O
and O
now O
, O
boom O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
all O
gone O
, O
including O
the O
only O
incentive N
they O
ever O
had O
, O
their O
pension N
. O

They're O
They O
're O
pathetic O
, O
man H
; O

certainly O
they O
haven't O
have O
n't O
much O
to O
offer O
when O
they O
look O
for O
jobs N
with O
the O
BBC O
. O

They're O
They O
're O
just O
not O
going O
to O
find O
any O
. O

They O
want O
to O
go O
, O
they're O
they O
're O
longing O
to O
, O
you H
can O
see O
they O
can't O
ca O
n't O
stand O
the O
sight N
of O
your H
face O
when O
you're O
you H
're O
working O
together O
... O
which O
makes O
things N
very O
pleasant O
, O
you H
can O
imagine O
... O

A O
slim O
little O
white O
girl H
slipped O
between O
them O
and O
took O
up O
Ras O
Asahe's O
Asahe O
's H
hand N
with O
the O
gold-metal O
watch-bracelet O
as O
if O
it O
were O
some O
possession N
she O
had O
put O
down O
... O

Save O
me H
from O
Daddy H
Dando O
. O

I H
could O
give O
you H
a O
dozen N
examples N
of O
the O
sort N
of O
thing N
that O
happens O
– O
the O
ceremony N
this O
afternoon N
: O
like O
a O
horse-race O
, O
man H
– O
the O
arrangements N
were O
exactly O
what O
they O
used O
to O
use N
for O
the O
charity N
Christmas N
Handicap N
, O
what O
else O
do O
they O
know O
? O

Suggest O
what O
you H
like O
, O
they O
just O
talk O
it O
away O
into O
the O
cigarette N
smoke N
, O
nobody O
even O
listens O
. O

The O
girl H
was O
there O
in O
their O
conversation N
like O
a O
photograph N
come O
upon O
lying O
between O
the O
pages N
of O
a O
book O
; O
Bray H
was O
not O
sure O
whether O
she O
was O
child H
or O
woman H
: O
thin O
collar-bones O
, O
a O
long O
neck N
with O
a O
face O
hardly O
wider O
, O
pale O
and O
sallow O
, O
a O
big O
, O
thin O
, O
unpainted O
mouth N
, O
black O
hair N
and O
glittering O
, O
sorrowful O
black O
eyes N
. O

She O
wore O
a O
dress N
made O
of O
Congo O
cloth N
. O

Suppose O
at O
the O
end N
of O
the O
year N
they O
were O
not O
put O
on O
contract N
? O

What O
about O
the O
golden O
handshake N
– O
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
it O
be O
cheaper O
, O
in O
the O
end N
? O

not O
if O
there's O
there O
's H
no O
preparation N
of O
replacements H
being O
done O
in O
the O
meantime N
. O

I H
tried O
two O
years N
ago O
to O
initiate O
a O
pilot N
scheme N
to O
send O
local O
people N
away O
for O
training O
in O
broadcasting O
techniques N
– O

If O
I H
had O
to O
take O
over O
the O
English-language O
services N
tomorrow N
, O
you H
know O
what O
I'd O
I H
'd O
have O
to O
do O
it O
with O
a O
bunch N
of O
Lambala O
and O
speakers H
from O
the O
vernacular O
sections N
and O
some O
refugee H
school-teachers O
from O
South O
Africa O
. O

The O
girl H
sat O
and O
saw O
nothing O
, O
like O
an O
animal A
out O
of O
breath N
, O
holed O
up O
against O
danger N
. O

Bray H
had O
to O
rise N
to O
be O
introduced O
to O
a O
big O
woman H
marking N
time N
on O
the O
edge N
of O
the O
dancers H
with O
the O
American O
, O
Curtis H
Pettigrew O
: O
she O
was O
a O
West H
African O
whom O
Timothy H
Odara O
had O
married O
since O
Bray H
saw O
him O
last O
.. O

She O
spoke O
with O
an O
American O
intonation N
, O
too O
, O
and O
in O
her O
flamboyant O
national O
dress N
, O
dragged O
round N
her O
as O
if O
snatched O
straight O
from O
the O
brilliant O
bolt N
on O
a O
shop N
counter O
, O
she O
seemed O
in O
every O
way N
twice O
the O
size N
of O
the O
local O
African O
women H
, O
who O
were O
usually O
kept O
at O
home N
, O
and O
showed O
it O
. O

Pettigrew O
was O
hailed O
by O
someone O
, O
and O
Bray H
and O
the O
woman H
were O
left O
facing O
each O
other O
like O
the O
dancers H
; O

she O
put O
her O
hand N
on O
his O
arm N
. O

While O
they O
moved O
off O
, O
she O
said O
, O
Guess O
what O
my H
name N
is O
? O

Same O
as O
yours O
, O
I H
believe O
. O

But O
they O
call O
me H
James H
. O

I H
should O
damn O
well O
hope O
so O
. O

Well O
, O
I've O
I H
've O
picked O
someone O
my H
own O
size N
at O
last O
tonight N
. O

We H
could O
just O
sweep O
the O
others O
off O
the O
floor N
. O

She O
maintained O
contact N
all O
round N
her O
as O
they O
danced O
, O
talking O
over O
his O
shoulder N
to O
this O
one O
, O
putting O
out O
a O
broad O
calloused O
brown O
foot N
in O
a O
gold N
sandal N
to O
nudge O
that O
one O
in O
the O
calf N
. O

Get O
her O
to O
sing O
, O
Dando O
called O
out O
proudly O
. O

not O
tonight N
, O
Dandy-Roly O
I'm O
I H
'm O
on O
my H
best O
behaviour N
. O

Would O
it O
embarrass O
Evelyn H
if O
Evelyn H
sang O
? O
she O
asked O
Bray H
. O

not O
in O
the O
least O
. O

What O
sort N
of O
thing N
? O

Well O
, O
what'd O
what O
'd O
you H
think O
? O

What O
do O
I H
look O
as O
if O
I'd O
I H
'd O
sing O
? O

She O
had O
the O
self-confidence N
of O
a O
woman H
of O
dynamic O
ugliness N
. O

A O
snort N
of O
pleasure N
: O

Go O
on O
! O

I've O
I H
've O
got O
a O
voice N
like O
a O
bullfrog A
. O

It's O
It O
's H
terrible O
when O
I H
sing O
the O
old O
chants N
from O
home N
but O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
so O
bad O
in O
English O
– O
English O
is O
such O
a O
rough-sounding O
language N
anyway O
. O

Vivien O
Bayley's O
Bayley O
's H
urgent O
face O
took O
up O
conversation N
in O
passing O
, O
... O
that's O
that O
's H
Hjalmar O
Wentz's O
Wentz O
's H
daughter H
... O
you H
were O
sitting O
with O
. O

The O
Oriental-looking O
little O
girl H
with O
Ras O
? O

Yes O
, O
lovely O
creature A
, O
isn't O
is O
n't O
she O
? O

Margot O
would O
only O
let O
her O
come O
if O
I H
promised O
to O
keep O
her O
wholesomely O
occupied O
. O

You H
didn't O
did O
n't O
leave O
her O
with O
Ras O
? O

He O
moved O
his O
shoulders N
helplessly O
. O

The O
dancers H
were O
falling O
back O
round N
a O
Polish O
agriculturalist H
who O
was O
teaching O
a O
gangling O
Englishman H
and O
two O
young O
Africans H
an O
Eastern O
European O
peasant H
dance N
. O

The O
Congolese O
band N
had O
no O
idea N
what O
music N
would O
do O
, O
and O
produced O
a O
stomping O
crescendo N
; O
then O
one O
of O
the O
Poles H
played O
the O
piano N
, O
and O
Neil H
Bayley O
moved O
in O
on O
the O
drums N
. O

The O
undergraduate H
form N
of O
self-expression N
that O
emerges O
where O
Englishmen H
want O
to O
give O
themselves O
to O
celebration N
imposed O
itself O
for O
a O
while O
. O

Someone O
left O
, O
and O
reappeared O
with O
another O
case N
of O
champagne N
. O

The O
wine N
was O
warm O
, O
but O
an O
early-hours-of-the-morning O
rain N
came O
out O
like O
sweat N
, O
and O
coolness N
blew O
in O
on O
necks N
and O
faces N
. O

Later O
the O
Odara O
woman H
sang O
the O
new O
national O
anthem N
in O
a O
beautiful O
contralto H
, O
her O
big O
belly N
trembling O
under O
the O
robe N
. O

The O
young O
bachelors H
romped O
and O
the O
tousled O
girls H
, O
passing O
close O
by O
, O
or O
smiling O
suddenly O
at O
people N
they O
weren't O
were O
n't O
aware O
of O
, O
gave O
up O
the O
scent N
of O
cosmetics N
and O
perfume N
heated O
on O
their O
bodies N
. O

Then O
there O
was O
breakfast N
at O
the O
Bayleys' O
; O
a O
thinning O
of O
faces N
, O
but O
some O
had O
kept O
reappearing O
all O
through O
the O
night O
in O
the O
changing O
light O
. O

They O
said O
good O
night O
to O
each O
other O
in O
the O
bright O
slanting O
sun N
and O
the O
Bayley O
children H
were O
already O
out O
on O
the O
grass A
in O
their O
pyjamas N
, O
riding O
bicycles N
. O

In O
a O
few O
days N
the O
faces N
had O
lost O
the O
stylized O
, O
apparition-quality O
of O
that O
first O
night O
, O
the O
night O
of O
the O
Independence N
Ball N
, O
and O
become O
, O
if O
not O
familiar O
, O
at O
least O
expected O
. O

A O
young O
woman H
was O
in O
and O
out O
the O
Bayleys O
' O
house N
, O
sometimes O
adding O
to O
, O
sometimes O
carrying O
off O
with O
her O
the O
many O
children H
who O
played O
there O
. O

She O
was O
Rebecca H
, O
Rebecca H
Edwards H
, O
like O
a O
big O
, O
untidy O
schoolgirl H
in O
her O
cotton N
shirt N
and O
sandals N
, O
the O
car N
key N
on O
her O
forefinger N
jingling O
harassedly O
. O

She O
was O
always O
being O
sent O
to O
pick O
up O
people N
when O
arrangements N
went O
wrong O
; O

she O
came O
for O
Bray H
one O
afternoon N
in O
an O
old O
station N
wagon N
littered O
with O
sweet-papers O
, O
odd O
socks N
, O
and O
Dinky O
toys N
. O

It O
was O
she O
who O
had O
given O
her O
glass N
to O
him O
that O
night O
at O
the O
Independence N
party N
; O

the O
Pole H
who O
had O
danced O
the O
gazatska O
became O
the O
man H
with O
whom O
he O
gravitated O
to O
a O
quiet O
corner N
so O
that O
they O
could O
talk O
about O
the O
curious O
grammar-structure O
of O
Gala N
and O
the O
Lambala O
group N
of O
languages N
. O

The O
atmosphere N
at O
the O
parties N
was O
what O
he O
thought O
it O
must O
have O
been O
at O
gatherings N
described O
in O
nineteenth-century O
Russian O
novels N
. O

Children H
swept O
in O
and O
out O
, O
belligerently O
pleasure-seeking O
. O

Babies H
slept O
in O
dark O
rooms N
. O

Food N
was O
cooked O
by O
many O
hands N
. O

Invitations N
were O
measured O
only O
by O
how O
long O
the O
beer N
and O
wine N
lasted O
out O
. O

He O
felt O
himself O
the O
middle-aged O
relative H
, O
a O
man H
of O
vague O
repute N
come O
from O
afar O
to O
the O
wedding N
and O
drawn O
helplessly O
and O
not O
unenjoyably O
into O
everything O
. O

It O
was O
, O
in O
a O
curious O
way N
, O
an O
extension N
of O
what O
he O
was O
at O
the O
official O
receptions N
where O
many O
people N
had O
little O
idea N
who O
the O
white O
stranger H
was O
, O
sitting O
in O
a O
modest O
place N
of O
honour N
; O

and O
once O
, O
at O
a O
press N
dinner N
Mweta's O
Mweta O
's H
reference N
to O
the O
presence N
of O
one O
of O
the O
fairy O
godmothers H
' O
who O
had O
been O
present O
at O
the O
christening O
and O
had O
returned O
for O
the O
coming-of-age O
of O
the O
State N
went O
, O
thank O
God H
, O
unnoticed O
as O
a O
reference N
to O
himself O
. O

It O
became O
his O
Independence N
story N
; O
as O
the O
story N
of O
the O
cigarette N
company's O
company N
's H
helicopter N
was O
Neil H
Bayley's O
Bayley O
's H
, O
related O
again O
and O
again O
while O
the O
private O
drama N
between O
husband H
and O
wife H
that O
had O
made O
it O
pass O
unremarked O
at O
the O
time N
was O
quite O
dropped O
out O
of O
the O
context N
. O

Bray H
asked O
everywhere O
about O
Edward H
Shinza O
; O
certainly O
he O
was O
not O
in O
evidence N
at O
any O
official O
occasion N
. O

Dobby O
blinked O
anxiously O
up O
at O
Harry H
. O

Harry H
wasn't O
was O
n't O
listening O
. O

He O
made O
a O
grab O
for O
the O
letters N
, O
but O
Dobby O
jumped O
out O
of O
reach N
. O

Ah O
, O
sir H
, O
this O
is O
a O
danger N
you H
must O
not O
face O
! O

Give O
me H
my H
friends H
' O
letters N
! O

Before O
Harry H
could O
move O
, O
Dobby O
had O
darted O
to O
the O
bedroom N
door N
, O
pulled O
it O
open O
– O
and O
sprinted O
down O
the O
stairs N
. O

Mouth N
dry O
, O
stomach O
lurching O
, O
Harry H
sprang O
after O
him O
, O
trying O
not O
to O
make O
a O
sound O
. O

He O
jumped O
the O
last O
six O
stairs N
, O
landing N
catlike O
on O
the O
hall N
carpet N
, O
looking O
around O
for O
Dobby O
. O

Harry H
ran O
up O
the O
hall N
into O
the O
kitchen N
and O
felt O
his O
stomach O
disappear O
. O

Aunt H
Petunia's O
Petunia O
's H
masterpiece N
of O
a O
pudding N
, O
the O
mountain N
of O
cream N
and O
sugared O
violets A
, O
was O
floating O
up O
near O
the O
ceiling N
. O

On O
top O
of O
a O
cupboard N
in O
the O
corner N
crouched O
Dobby O
. O

Harry H
Potter H
must O
say O
he's O
he O
's H
not O
going O
back O
to O
school N
– O

Dobby O
gave O
him O
a O
tragic O
look O
. O

The O
pudding N
fell O
to O
the O
floor N
with O
a O
heart-stopping O
crash N
. O

Cream N
splattered O
the O
windows N
and O
walls N
as O
the O
dish N
shattered O
. O

With O
a O
crack N
like O
a O
whip N
, O
Dobby O
vanished O
. O

There O
were O
screams N
from O
the O
dining O
room N
and O
Uncle H
Vernon H
burst O
into O
the O
kitchen N
to O
find O
Harry H
, O
rigid O
with O
shock N
, O
covered O
from O
head N
to O
foot N
in O
Aunt H
Petunia's O
Petunia O
's H
pudding N
. O

At O
first O
, O
it O
looked O
as O
though O
Uncle H
Vernon H
would O
manage O
to O
gloss O
the O
whole O
thing N
over O
( O
Just O
our H
nephew H
– O
very O
disturbed O
meeting O
strangers H
upsets O
him O
, O
so O
we H
kept O
him O
upstairs O
) O

He O
shooed O
the O
shocked O
Masons O
back O
into O
the O
dining O
room N
, O
promised O
Harry H
he O
would O
flay O
him O
to O
within O
an O
inch N
of O
his O
life N
when O
the O
Masons O
had O
left O
, O
and O
handed O
him O
a O
mop N
. O

Aunt H
Petunia O
dug O
some O
ice-cream O
out O
of O
the O
freezer N
and O
Harry H
, O
still O
shaking O
, O
started O
scrubbing O
the O
kitchen N
clean O
. O

Uncle H
Vernon H
might O
still O
have O
been O
able O
to O
make O
his O
deal N
– O
if O
it O
hadn't O
had O
n't O
been O
for O
the O
owl A
. O

Aunt H
Petunia O
was O
just O
handing O
round N
a O
box N
of O
after-dinner O
mints N
when O
a O
huge O
barn N
owl A
swooped O
through O
the O
dining O
room N
window N
, O
dropped O
a O
letter N
on O
Mrs N
Mason's O
Mason H
's H
head N
and O
swooped O
out O
again O
. O

Mrs N
Mason H
screamed O
like O
a O
banshee A
and O
ran O
from O
the O
house N
, O
shouting O
about O
lunatics H
. O

Mr N
Mason H
stayed O
just O
long O
enough O
to O
tell O
the O
Dursleys O
that O
his O
wife H
was O
mortally O
afraid O
of O
birds A
of O
all O
shapes N
and O
sizes N
, O
and O
to O
ask O
whether O
this O
was O
their O
idea N
of O
a O
joke N
. O

Harry H
stood O
in O
the O
kitchen N
, O
clutching O
the O
mop N
for O
support N
as O
Uncle H
Vernon H
advanced O
on O
him O
, O
a O
demonic O
glint N
in O
his O
tiny O
eyes N
. O

Harry H
took O
it O
. O

It O
did O
not O
contain O
birthday N
greetings N
. O

Dear O

Potter H
, O

Harry H
looked O
up O
from O
the O
letter N
and O
gulped O
. O

He O
was O
bearing O
down O
on O
Harry H
like O
a O
great O
bulldog A
, O
all O
his O
teeth N
bared O
. O

Well O
, O
I've O
I H
've O
got O
news N
for O
you H
, O
boy H
. O
I'm O
I H
'm O
locking O
you H
up O
you're O
you H
're O
never O
going O
back O
to O
that O
school N
. O
Never O
. O
And O
if O
you H
try O
and O
magic N
yourself H
out O
– O
they'll O
they O
'll O
expel O
you H
! O

And O
laughing O
like O
a O
maniac H
, O
he O
dragged O
Harry H
back O
upstairs O
. O

Uncle H
Vernon H
was O
as O
bad O
as O
his O
word N
. O

The O
following O
morning N
, O
he O
paid O
a O
man H
to O
fit O
bars N
on O
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
window N
. O

He O
himself O
fitted O
a O
cat-flap O
in O
the O
bedroom N
door N
, O
so O
that O
small O
amounts N
of O
food N
could O
be O
pushed O
inside O
three O
times N
a O
day N
. O

They O
let O
Harry H
out O
to O
use N
the O
bathroom N
morning N
and O
evening N
. O

Otherwise O
, O
he O
was O
locked O
in O
his O
room N
around O
the O
clock N
. O

Three O
days N
later O
, O
the O
Dursleys O
were O
showing O
no O
sign O
of O
relenting O
and O
Harry H
couldn't O
could O
n't O
see O
any O
way N
out O
of O
his O
situation N
. O

He O
lay O
on O
his O
bed N
watching O
the O
sun N
sinking O
behind O
the O
bars N
on O
the O
window N
and O
wondered O
miserably O
what O
was O
going O
to O
happen O
to O
him O
. O

What O
was O
the O
good O
of O
magicking O
himself O
out O
of O
his O
room N
if O
Hogwarts O
would O
expel O
him O
for O
doing O
it O
? O

Yet O
life N
at O
Privet O
Drive O
had O
reached O
an O
all-time O
low O
. O

Now O
that O
the O
Dursleys O
knew O
they O
weren't O
were O
n't O
going O
to O
wake O
up O
as O
fruitbats O
, O
he O
had O
lost O
his O
only O
weapon N
. O

Dobby O
might O
have O
saved O
Harry H
from O
horrible O
happenings N
at O
Hogwarts O
, O
but O
the O
way N
things N
were O
going O
, O
he'd O
he O
'd O
probably O
starve O
to O
death N
anyway O
. O

The O
cat-flap O
rattled O
and O
Aunt H
Petunia's O
Petunia O
's H
hand N
appeared O
, O
pushing O
a O
bowl N
of O
tinned O
soup N
into O
the O
room N
. O

Harry H
, O
whose O
insides N
were O
aching O
with O
hunger N
, O
jumped O
off O
his O
bed N
and O
seized O
it O
. O

The O
soup N
was O
stone N
cold O
, O
but O
he O
drank O
half O
of O
it O
in O
one O
gulp N
. O

Then O
he O
crossed O
the O
room N
to O
Hedwig's O
Hedwig O
's H
cage N
and O
tipped O
the O
soggy O
vegetables N
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
bowl N
into O
her O
empty O
food N
tray N
. O

She O
ruffled O
her O
feathers N
and O
gave O
him O
a O
look O
of O
deep O
disgust N
. O

He O
put O
the O
empty O
bowl N
back O
on O
the O
floor N
next O
to O
the O
cat-flap O
and O
lay O
back O
down O
on O
the O
bed N
, O
somehow O
even O
hungrier O
than O
he O
had O
been O
before O
the O
soup N
. O

Supposing O
he O
was O
still O
alive O
in O
another O
four O
weeks N
, O
what O
would O
happen O
if O
he O
didn't O
did O
n't O
turn O
up O
at O
Hogwarts O
? O

Would O
someone O
be O
sent O
to O
see O
why O
he O
hadn't O
had O
n't O
come O
back O
? O

Would O
they O
be O
able O
to O
make O
the O
Dursleys O
let O
him O
go O
? O

The O
room N
was O
growing O
dark O
. O

Exhausted O
, O
stomach O
rumbling O
, O
mind N
spinning O
over O
the O
same O
unanswerable O
questions N
, O
Harry H
fell O
into O
an O
uneasy O
sleep N
. O

There O
was O
a O
big O
photograph N
on O
the O
front N
of O
a O
very O
good-looking O
wizard H
with O
wavy O
blond O
hair N
and O
bright O
blue O
eyes N
. O

As O
always O
in O
the O
wizarding O
world N
, O
the O
photograph N
was O
moving O
; O
the O
wizard H
, O
who O
Harry H
supposed O
was O
Gilderoy O
Lockhart O
, O
kept O
winking O
cheekily O
up O
at O
them O
all O
. O

Mrs N
Weasley O
beamed O
down O
at O
him O
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
be O
so O
ridiculous O
, O
Fred H
, O
said O
Mrs N
Weasley O
, O
her O
cheeks N
rather O
pink O
. O

Yawning O
and O
grumbling O
, O
the O
Weasleys O
slouched O
outside O
with O
Harry H
behind O
them O
. O

The O
garden N
was O
large O
, O
and O
in O
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
eyes N
, O
exactly O
what O
a O
garden N
should O
be O
. O

The O
Dursleys O
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
have O
liked O
it O
– O
there O
were O
plenty N
of O
weeds A
, O
and O
the O
grass A
needed O
cutting O
– O
but O
there O
were O
gnarled O
trees A
all O
around O
the O
walls N
, O
plants A
Harry H
had O
never O
seen O
spilling O
from O
every O
flowerbed N
and O
a O
big O
green O
pond N
full O
of O
frogs A
. O

There O
was O
a O
violent O
scuffling O
noise N
, O
the O
peony A
bush A
shuddered O
and O
Ron H
straightened O
up O
. O

This O
is O
a O
gnome A
, O
he O
said O
grimly O
. O

It O
was O
certainly O
nothing O
like O
Father H
Christmas N
. O

It O
was O
small O
and O
leathery-looking O
, O
with O
a O
large O
, O
knobbly O
, O
bald O
head N
exactly O
like O
a O
potato N
. O

Ron H
held O
it O
at O
arm's O
arm N
's H
length N
as O
it O
kicked O
out O
at O
him O
with O
its O
horny O
little O
feet N
; O
he O
grasped O
it O
around O
the O
ankles N
and O
turned O
it O
upside-down O
. O

Seeing O
the O
shocked O
look O
on O
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
face O
, O
Ron H
added O
, O
It O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
hurt O
them O
– O
you've O
you H
've O
just O
got O
to O
make O
them O
really O
dizzy O
so O
they O
can't O
ca O
n't O
find O
their O
way N
back O
to O
the O
gnomeholes O
. O

He O
let O
go O
of O
the O
gnome's O
gnome A
's H
ankles N
: O
it O
flew O
twenty O
feet N
into O
the O
air O
and O
landed O
with O
a O
thud N
in O
the O
field O
over O
the O
hedge N
. O

Harry H
learned O
quickly O
not O
to O
feel O
too O
sorry O
for O
the O
gnomes A
. O

He O
decided O
just O
to O
drop O
the O
first O
one O
he O
caught O
over O
the O
hedge N
, O
but O
the O
gnome A
, O
sensing O
weakness N
, O
sank O
its O
razor-sharp O
teeth N
into O
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
finger N
and O
he O
had O
a O
hard O
job N
shaking O
it O
off O
until O
– O

The O
air O
was O
soon O
thick O
with O
flying O
gnomes A
. O

The O
moment N
they O
know O
the O
de-gnoming's O
de-gnoming O
's H
going O
on O
they O
storm O
up O
to O
have O
a O
look O
. O

Soon O
, O
the O
crowd N
of O
gnomes A
in O
the O
field O
started O
walking O
away O
in O
a O
straggling O
line N
, O
their O
little O
shoulders N
hunched O
. O

Just O
then O
, O
the O
front N
door N
slammed O
. O

He's O
He O
's H
back O
! O
said O
George H
. O

They O
hurried O
through O
the O
garden N
and O
back O
into O
the O
house N
. O

Mr N
Weasley O
was O
slumped O
in O
a O
kitchen N
chair N
with O
his O
glasses N
off O
and O
his O
eyes N
closed O
. O

He O
was O
a O
thin O
man H
, O
going O
bald O
, O
but O
the O
little O
hair N
he O
had O
was O
as O
red O
as O
any O
of O
his O
children's O
children H
's H
. O

He O
was O
wearing O
long O
green O
robes N
which O
were O
dusty O
and O
travel-worn O
. O

Mr N
Weasley O
took O
a O
long O
gulp N
of O
tea N
and O
sighed O
. O

Find O
anything O
, O
Dad H
? O
said O
Fred H
eagerly O
. O

Just O
Muggle-baiting O
, O
sighed O
Mr N
Weasley O
. O

of O
course O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
very O
hard O
to O
convict O
anyone O
because O
no O
Muggle O
would O
admit O
their O
key N
keeps O
shrinking O
– O
they'll O
they O
'll O
insist O
they O
just O
keep O
losing O
it O
. O

Mrs N
Weasley O
had O
appeared O
, O
holding O
a O
long O
poker N
like O
a O
sword N
. O

Mr N
Weasley's O
Weasley O
's H
eyes N
jerked O
open O
. O

He O
stared O
guiltily O
at O
his O
wife H
. O

Yes O
, O
Arthur H
, O
cars N
, O
said O
Mrs N
Weasley O
, O
her O
eyes N
flashing O
. O

Mr N
Weasley O
blinked O
. O

Just O
so O
you H
could O
carry O
on O
tinkering O
with O
all O
that O
Muggle O
rubbish N
in O
your H
shed N
! O

He O
looked O
around O
, O
saw O
Harry H
, O
and O
jumped O
. O

Very O
pleased O
to O
meet O
you H
, O
Ron's O
Ron H
's H
told O
us H
so O
much O
about O
– O

I H
– O
I H
mean O
, O
he O
faltered O
as O
sparks N
flew O
from O
Mrs N
Weasley's O
Weasley O
's H
eyes N
, O
that O
– O
that O
was O
very O
wrong O
, O
boys H
– O
very O
wrong O
indeed O

They O
slipped O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen N
and O
down O
a O
narrow O
passageway N
to O
an O
uneven O
staircase N
, O
which O
zigzagged O
its O
way N
up O
through O
the O
house N
. O

On O
the O
third O
landing N
, O
a O
door N
stood O
ajar O
. O

Harry H
just O
caught O
sight N
of O
a O
pair N
of O
bright O
brown O
eyes N
staring O
at O
him O
before O
it O
closed O
with O
a O
snap N
. O

They O
climbed O
two O
more O
flights N
until O
they O
reached O
a O
door N
with O
peeling O
paint N
and O
a O
small O
plaque N
on O
it O
, O
saying O
Ronald's O
Ronald H
's H
Room N
. O

Harry H
stepped O
in O
, O
his O
head N
almost O
touching O
the O
sloping O
ceiling N
, O
and O
blinked O
. O

It O
was O
like O
walking O
into O
a O
furnace N
: O
nearly O
everything O
in O
Ron's O
Ron H
's H
room N
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
violent O
shade N
of O
orange O
: O
the O
bedspread N
, O
the O
walls N
, O
even O
the O
ceiling N
. O

Then O
Harry H
realised O
that O
Ron H
had O
covered O
nearly O
every O
inch N
of O
the O
shabby O
wallpaper N
with O
posters N
of O
the O
same O
seven O
witches H
and O
wizards H
, O
all O
wearing O
bright O
orange O
robes N
, O
carrying O
broomsticks N
, O
and O
waving O
energetically O
. O

Ron's O
Ron H
's H
school N
spellbooks O
were O
stacked O
untidily O
in O
a O
corner N
, O
next O
to O
a O
pile N
of O
comics H
that O
all O
seemed O
to O
feature O
The O
Adventures N
of O
Martin H
Miggs O
, O
the O
Mad O
Muggle O
. O

Ron's O
Ron H
's H
magic N
wand N
was O
lying O
on O
top O
of O
a O
fish A
tank N
full O
of O
frog A
spawn A
on O
the O
window-sill O
, O
next O
to O
his O
fat O
grey O
rat A
, O
Scabbers O
, O
who O
was O
snoozing O
in O
a O
patch N
of O
sun N
. O

Harry H
stepped O
over O
a O
pack N
of O
Self-Shuffling O
playing O
cards N
on O
the O
floor N
and O
looked O
out O
of O
the O
tiny O
window N
. O

In O
the O
field O
far O
below O
he O
could O
see O
a O
gang N
of O
gnomes A
sneaking O
, O
one O
by O
one O
, O
back O
through O
the O
Weasleys O
hedge N
. O

Then O
he O
turned O
to O
look O
at O
Ron H
, O
who O
was O
watching O
him O
almost O
nervously O
, O
as O
though O
waiting O
for O
his O
opinion N
. O

Not O
like O
that O
room N
you H
had O
with O
the O
Muggles O
. O

Ron's O
Ron H
's H
ears N
went O
pink O
. O

Life N
at O
The O
Burrow N
was O
as O
different O
as O
possible O
from O
life N
in O
Privet O
Drive O
. O

The O
Dursleys O
liked O
everything O
neat O
and O
ordered O
; O
the O
Weasleys O
house N
burst O
with O
the O
strange O
and O
unexpected O
. O

The O
ghoul H
in O
the O
attic N
howled O
and O
dropped O
pipes N
whenever O
he O
felt O
things N
were O
getting O
too O
quiet O
, O
and O
small O
explosions N
from O
Fred H
and O
George's O
George H
's H
bedroom N
were O
considered O
perfectly O
normal O
. O

What O
Harry H
found O
most O
unusual O
about O
life N
at O
Ron's O
Ron H
's H
, O
however O
, O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
the O
talking O
mirror N
or O
the O
clanking O
ghoul H
: O
it O
was O
the O
fact N
that O
everybody O
there O
seemed O
to O
like O
him O
. O

Mrs N
Weasley O
fussed O
over O
the O
state N
of O
his O
socks N
and O
tried O
to O
force O
him O
to O
eat O
fourth O
helpings N
at O
every O
meal N
. O

Mr N
Weasley O
liked O
Harry H
to O
sit O
next O
to O
him O
at O
the O
dinner N
table N
so O
that O
he O
could O
bombard O
him O
with O
questions N
about O
life N
with O
Muggles O
, O
asking O
him O
to O
explain O
how O
things N
like O
plugs N
and O
the O
postal O
service N
worked O
. O

Ingenious O
, O
really O
, O
how O
many O
ways N
Muggles O
have O
found O
of O
getting O
along O
without O
magic N
. O

Harry H
heard O
from O
Hogwarts O
one O
sunny O
morning N
about O
a O
week N
after O
he O
had O
arrived O
at O
The O
Burrow N
. O

He O
and O
Ron H
went O
down O
to O
breakfast N
to O
find O
Mr N
and O
Mrs N
Weasley O
and O
Ginny O
already O
sitting O
at O
the O
kitchen N
table N
. O

' O
And O
did O
he O
? O
' O

' O
What O
? O
' O

' O
Become O
somebody O
else O
. O
' O

' O
Yes O
. O
Yes O
he O
did O
. O
' O

There O
were O
compensations N
. O

Now O
that O
I H
was O
officially O
not O
clever O
my H
father H
began O
to O
take O
me H
with O
him O
on O
his O
business N
trips N
. O

He O
reckoned O
that O
if O
I H
could O
not O
benefit O
from O
an O
expensive O
education N
I H
could O
perhaps O
benefit O
from O
experience O
. O

My H
sisters H
were O
sent O
to O
board O
at O
Benenden O
, O
I H
went O
to O
the O
local O
Catholic O
school N
, O
from O
whose O
piety N
and O
Home N
Economics N
lessons N
I H
was O
frequently O
removed O
to O
accompany O
my H
father H
. O

In O
1973 O
, O
when O
I H
was O
thirteen O
, O
we H
flew O
to O
New O
York O
to O
join O
the O
QE2 O
on O
a O
Comet N
Watch N
. O

It O
was O
this O
that O
constellated O
my H
future N
. O

And O
if O
she O
was O
thinking O
of O
the O
school N
, O
or O
his O
first O
job N
in O
a O
collar N
and O
tie O
while O
his O
mates H
were O
at O
the O
boats N
, O
or O
the O
ordinary O
girl H
who O
had O
loved O
him O
, O
or O
her O
own O
pride N
, O
she O
never O
told O
me H
, O
then O
or O
at O
any O
time N
. O

Like O
my H
father H
she O
could O
not O
speak O
what O
she O
felt O
. O

Unlike O
him O
she O
knew O
this O
and O
sat O
many O
hours N
with O
her O
head N
in O
her O
hands N
, O
I H
thought O
then O
, O
to O
make O
the O
words N
fall O
out O
. O

But O
the O
words N
did O
not O
fall O
out O
and O
her O
feelings N
hung O
inside O
her O
, O
preserved O
. O

' O
Oh O
not O
yet O
, O
' O
said O
my H
mother H
. O

Father H
said O
: O
' O
There O
was O
nothing O
to O
tell O
. O
' O

I H
felt O
that O
my H
father H
had O
gone O
to O
his O
death N
. O

' O
I H
should O
have O
tidied O
up O
first O
, O
' O
she O
said O
. O

Alluvia N
: O
the O
deposits N
collected O
and O
jetted O
by O
the O
river N
. O

' O
You H
were O
born O
in O
1940 O
. O

He O
was O
born O
in O
1947 O
. O
' O

I H
wear O
a O
white O
coat N
, O
tie O
my H
hair N
back O
and O
assume O
the O
proper O
attitude N
to O
what O
I H
call O
my H
life N
. O

I H
will O
examine O
it O
, O
but O
underneath O
the O
dark O
things N
stir O
. O

What O
would O
happen O
if O
I H
came O
face O
to O
face O
with O
what O
I H
am O
? O

I H
think O
it O
is O
happening O
but O
because O
I H
do O
not O
recognise O
myself H
I H
say O
it O
is O
somebody O
else O
; O
him O
, O
her O
, O
them O
, O
who O
are O
responsible O
. O

Responsible O
for O
my H
terror H
. O

Every O
piece N
of O
furniture N
in O
the O
room N
has O
been O
destroyed O
. O

It O
was O
night O
, O
about O
a O
quarter N
to O
twelve O
, O
the O
sky N
divided O
in O
halves N
, O
one O
cloudy O
, O
the O
other O
fair N
. O

The O
stars N
were O
deep O
recessed O
, O
not O
lying O
on O
the O
surface N
of O
the O
night O
but O
hammered O
into O
it O
. O

The O
water N
, O
where O
the O
ship N
cutted O
it O
, O
was O
broken O
and O
white O
, O
but O
once O
the O
ship N
had O
passed O
the O
water N
healed O
the O
intrusion N
and O
I H
could O
not O
see O
where O
the O
black O
of O
the O
sky N
and O
the O
black O
of O
the O
water N
changed O
into O
each O
other O
. O

I H
thought O
of O
my H
often-dream O
where O
Time N
poured O
the O
fishes A
into O
the O
sky N
and O
the O
sky N
was O
full O
of O
star N
fish A
; O
stella O
maris O
of O
the O
upper O
air O
. O

There O
are O
many O
legends N
among O
seafaring O
people N
of O
a O
bright O
fish A
so O
hot O
that O
it O
shines O
in O
the O
deepest O
water N
, O
a O
star N
dropped O
and O
finned O
from O
God H

My H
mother H
lay O
awake O
pondering O
the O
matter N
and O
applied O
with O
some O
urgency N
to O
her O
father H
next O
morning N
. O

What O
could O
be O
done O
? O
Nothing O
. O

The O
young O
man H
had O
only O
recently O
been O
promoted O
in O
charge N
of O
the O
Atlantic O
crossings N
. O

He O
would O
have O
to O
prove O
himself O
there O
. O

Unfortunately O
he O
resisted O
all O
attempts N
by O
my H
mother H
to O
prove O
himself O
elsewhere O
. O

In O
despair N
my H
mother H
consulted O
my H
grandmother H
who O
suggested O
they O
try O
the O
Navy N
Position N
. O

This O
down-to-earth O
advice N
was O
not O
well O
received O
by O
my H
father H
who O
had O
already O
added O
a O
veneer N
of O
conventional O
morality N
to O
his O
conventional O
respectability N
. O

' O
But O
Jove O
is O
younger O
than O
you H
. O
' O

There O
he O
is O
, O
built O
like O
King H
Kong H
, O
as O
ambitious O
as O
the O
Empire N
State N
Building N
, O
as O
wide-eyed O
as O
Fay H
Wray O
, O
and O
as O
much O
a O
dream N
, O
an O
invention N
, O
as O
the O
movies N
and O
America O
itself O
. O

He O
was O
a O
giant O
projection N
on O
the O
blank O
screen N
of O
other O
people N
and O
that O
was O
his O
success N
. O

He O
was O
not O
a O
ruthless O
man H
but O
he O
believed O
in O
himself O
. O

That O
marked O
him O
out O
from O
the O
many O
others O
who O
believed O
in O
nothing O
at O
all O
. O

My H
grandmother H
, O
who O
was O
not O
a O
nervous O
type N
, O
said O
to O
herself O
, O
' O
David H
must O
have O
got O
his O
promotion N
. O
' O

Nodding O
, O
she O
finished O
the O
chapter N
, O
let O
out O
the O
bath N
water N
and O
trudged O
home N
. O

He O
slept O
in O
his O
dressing O
room N
for O
the O
first O
couple N
of O
months N
. O

After O
my H
mother H
had O
fed O
me H
, O
sometime O
around O
5 O
a.m. O
, O
she O
would O
fall O
into O
a O
deep O
sleep N
and O
my H
father H
used O
to O
creep O
in O
and O
pick O
me H
up O
in O
his O
huge O
hands N
and O
take O
me H
to O
his O
room N
where O
the O
fire N
glowed O
. O

Perhaps O
it O
was O
there O
, O
held O
by O
him O
, O
in O
front N
of O
the O
mirror N
, O
the O
strange O
room N
in O
reflection N
behind O
, O
that O
I H
came O
to O
imagine O
other O
places N
, O
glowing O
steadily O
, O
just O
out O
of O
reach N
. O

I H
would O
argue O
with O
that O
. O

' O
London O
, O
' O
said O
my H
grandmother H
, O
pronouncing O
it O
Hell O
. O

' O
Where's O
Where O
's H
the O
difficulty N
in O
that O
? O
' O

I H
want O
to O
feel O
but O
with O
feeling N
comes O
pain N
. O

I H
could O
advise O
myself H
to O
keep O
out O
of O
complications N
and O
I H
won't O
wo O
n't O
pretend O
that O
I H
have O
had O
no O
choice N
in O
any O
of O
this O
. O

I H
have O
noticed O
that O
choices N
seem O
to O
be O
made O
in O
advance N
of O
what O
is O
chosen O
. O

The O
time N
gap N
in O
between O
the O
determining O
will O
and O
the O
determined O
event N
is O
a O
handy O
excuse N
to O
deny O
causality N
. O

In O
space-time N
there O
is O
always O
a O
lag N
between O
prediction N
and O
response N
( O
synchronicity N
is O
a O
higher O
dimension N
phenomenon N
where O
the O
rules N
of O
space-time N
do O
not O
apply O
) O
, O
sometimes O
of O
seconds N
, O
sometimes O
of O
years N
, O
but O
we H
programme O
events N
far O
more O
than O
we H
like O
to O
think O
. O

I H
do O
not O
say O
this O
is O
conscious O
, O
usually O
it O
is O
not O
, O
and O
there O
lies O
the O
difficulty N
. O

I H
have O
seen O
my H
father H
pushing O
the O
world N
, O
he O
quite O
unaware O
of O
what O
was O
pushing O
him O
. O

He O
did O
not O
believe O
in O
the O
unconscious O
, O
except O
as O
a O
soup N
of O
fantasy N
and O
half-memories O
that O
entertained O
his O
sleep N
. O

To O
suggest O
, O
as O
I H
did O
, O
that O
the O
mind N
is O
a O
self-regulating O
system N
, O
where O
consciousness N
and O
unconsciousness N
work N
as O
load-balancing O
pulleys N
, O
roused O
anger N
enough O
to O
make O
me H
think O
I H
had O
touched O
something O
relevant O
. O

I H
continued O
my H
reading N
: O
Paracelsus O
, O
Jung H
, O
Einstein H
, O
Freud H
, O
Capra O
, O
and O
although O
I H
still O
know O
nothing O
, O
I H
am O
no O
longer O
a O
disciple H
of O
Fate N
. O

' O
I H
see O
why O
he O
likes O
you H
, O
' O
said O
Stella H
, O
examining O
my H
neck N
with O
her O
fingers N
. O

What O
can O
a O
little O
girl H
see O
that O
astronomers H
and O
telescopes N
cannot O
? O

There O
was O
no O
comet N
sighted O
on O
the O
official O
log N
of O
the O
journey N
. O

What O
was O
it O
then O
that O
hooped O
together O
ordinary O
night O
with O
infinity N
? O

I H
saw O
the O
silver N
prow N
pass O
over O
me H
and O
the O
sails N
in O
tattered O
cloth N
. O

Men H
and O
women H
crowded O
at O
the O
deck N
. O

There O
was O
a O
shuddering O
, O
as O
though O
the O
world-clock O
had O
stopped O
, O
though O
in O
fact N
it O
was O
our H
own O
ship N
that O
had O
thrown O
its O
engines N
in O
reverse N
. O

In O
the O
morning N
my H
father H
told O
me H
that O
we H
had O
identified O
an O
unknown O
signal N
, O
thought O
to O
be O
a O
vessel N
just O
ahead O
of O
us H
, O
though O
nothing O
at O
all O
was O
found O
. O

And O
she O
told O
me H
how O
she O
and O
her O
mother H
had O
visited O
the O
diner H
once O
a O
week N
, O
on O
a O
Saturday N
, O
for O
the O
next O
eleven O
years N
. O

It O
had O
to O
be O
Saturday N
. O
The O
Jewish O
Shabbat O
. O
Papa's O
Papa H
's H
ecstasy N
. O
Mama's O
Mama H
's H
defiance N
. O

Her O
daughter H
was O
not O
Jewish O
. O

Jewishness O
is O
continued O
through O
the O
female O
line N
. O

Mama H
would O
not O
have O
her O
daughter H
given O
up O
to O
Papa's O
Papa H
's H
passion N
. O

He O
left O
his O
desk N
with O
its O
four O
black O
telephones N
and O
filing O
tray N
, O
and O
without O
stopping O
to O
collect O
any O
luggage N
, O
bought O
an O
aeroplane N
ticket N
for O
the O
evening N
flight N
. O

In O
1959 O
flying O
was O
odd O
, O
glamorous O
, O
expensive O
and O
blissful O
. O

There O
was O
a O
fifteen-minute O
check-in N
time N
and O
my H
father H
walked O
across O
the O
tarmac N
and O
boarded O
the O
twin-propeller O
plane N
with O
only O
his O
toothbrush N
to O
declare O
. O

Her O
breasts N
as O
my H
breasts N
, O
her O
mouth N
as O
my H
mouth N
, O
were O
more O
than O
Narcissus O
hypnotised O
by O
his O
own O
likeness N
. O

Everybody O
knows O
how O
the O
story N
changes O
when O
he O
disturbs O
the O
water N
. O

I H
did O
disturb O
the O
water N
and O
the O
perfect O
picture N
broke O
. O

You H
see O
, O
I H
could O
have O
rested O
there O
beside O
her O
, O
perhaps O
forever O
, O
it O
felt O
like O
forever O
, O
a O
mirror N
confusion N
of O
bodies N
and O
sighs N
, O
undifferentiated O
, O
she O
in O
me H
, O
me H
in O
she O
and O
no O
longer O
exhausted O
by O
someone O
else's O
else O
's H
shape O
over O
mine H
. O

And O
I H
had O
not O
expected O
such O
intense O
physical O
pleasure N
. O

The O
little O
boy H
had O
never O
seen O
a O
baby H
pink O
as O
a O
wolf's O
wolf A
's H
tongue N
. O

' O
Too O
polite O
to O
be O
an O
American O
. O
' O

' O
I H
suppose O
I H
am O
. O

My H
father H
used O
to O
come O
here O
. O

He O
loved O
New O
York O
. O

He O
said O
it O
was O
the O
only O
place N
in O
the O
world N
where O
a O
man H
could O
be O
himself O
while O
working O
his O
shirt N
off O
to O
become O
somebody O
else O
. O

The O
dream N
to O
pan O
the O
living O
clay N
that O
you H
are O
and O
find O
gold N
in O
it O
. O

Perhaps O
my H
father H
was O
a O
treasure N
chest N
because O
he O
seemed O
to O
be O
able O
to O
lay O
up O
for O
himself O
inexhaustible O
riches N
. O

Whatever O
he O
tried O
succeeded O
. O

He O
should O
have O
been O
a O
Venetian O
merchant H
pacing O
the O
Rialto O
. O

He O
should O
have O
been O
Marco H
Polo H
winning O
furs N
out O
of O
Muscovy N
. O

Is O
that O
him O
, O
on O
the O
log N
rafts N
in O
Quebec O
? O

Is O
that O
him O
riding O
rapids N
with O
the O
snow N
mantling O
his O
shoulders N
? O

He O
was O
a O
man H
who O
belonged O
with O
an O
elk A
, O
with O
a O
moose A
. O

A O
whale H
man H
, O
a O
bear O
man H
. O

Instead O
he O
wore O
a O
loose O
suit N
and O
a O
trilby A
and O
learned O
how O
to O
net N
a O
profit N
. O

His O
hauls N
were O
the O
biggest O
in O
the O
Company N
and O
he O
turned O
them O
in O
like O
a O
little O
boy H
. O

In O
those O
days N
his O
true O
self N
was O
still O
fighting O
with O
his O
assumed O
self N

winning O

his O
death N

You H
have O
requested O
a O
debate N
on O
this O
subject N
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
next O
few O
days N
, O
during O
this O
part N
- O
session N
. O

The O
Cunha O
report N
on O
multiannual O
guidance N
programmes N
comes O
before O
Parliament N
on O
Thursday N
and O
contains O
a O
proposal N
in O
paragraph N
6 O
that O
a O
form N
of O
quota N
penalties N
should O
be O
introduced O
for O
countries N
which O
fail O
to O
meet O
their O
fleet O
reduction N
targets N
annually O
. O

Mr N
Berenguer O
Fuster O
, O
we H
shall O
check O
all O
this O
. O

I H
should O
like O
to O
address N
one O
final O
point N
. O

I H
do O
realise O
that O
this O
is O
only O
a O
small O
step N
towards O
increased O
transport N
safety N
, O
but O
I H
would O
ask O
you H
to O
endorse O
this O
report N
. O

I H
am O
speaking O
for O
the O
first O
time N
in O
this O
plenary O
part N
- O
session N
, O
so O
this O
is O
quite O
exciting O
for O
me H
, O
a O
little O
like O
first O
love O
, O
although O
that O
did O
last O
longer O
than O
two O
minutes N
. O

In O
many O
ways N
, O
the O
prerequisites N
differ O
from O
one O
Member H
State N
to O
another O
. O

The O
reason N
Mr N
Koch H
produced O
his O
sound O
report N
was O
because O
the O
work N
in O
the O
CEN O
and O
within O
the O
United O
Nations O
Economic O
Commission N
was O
proceeding O
none O
too O
expeditiously O
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
I H
would O
once O
again O
like O
to O
congratulate O
Mr N
Koch H
on O
his O
magnificent O
work N
on O
this O
other O
report N
, O
which O
in O
a O
way N
supplements O
the O
debate N
which O
we H
held O
in O
October O
on O
rail N
transport N
. O

We H
have O
to O
remember O
that O
rural O
areas N
represent O
almost O
four O
fifths N
of O
the O
territory N
of O
the O
European O
Union O
. O

We H
are O
badly O
behind O
now O
in O
this O
matter N
. O

We H
oppose O
the O
excessive O
control N
the O
central O
administration N
of O
the O
Union O
and O
its O
Member H
States N
exercises O
and O
we H
are O
calling O
for O
a O
reduction N
in O
the O
bureaucracy N
that O
has O
taken O
root N
in O
the O
drafting N
and O
implementation N
of O
programmes N
. O

The O
Structural O
Funds N
have O
played O
a O
key N
role N
in O
the O
development N
both O
of O
urban O
and O
rural O
parts N
of O
peripheral O
countries N
, O
mainly O
through O
the O
upgrading O
of O
roads N
, O
water N
treatment N
and O
related O
transport N
networks N
. O

how O
can O
we H
ensure O
that O
Union O
policy N
interfaces O
with O
the O
subsidiary O
national O
policies N
for O
regional O
development N
? O

as O
far O
as O
French O
planning N
experts H
are O
concerned O
, O
for O
example N
, O
the O
most O
probable O
scenario N
today N
is O
that O
of O
the O
entrenchment N
of O
regional O
disparities N
within O
each O
country N
. O

? O

That O
top O

I H
love O
a O
challenge N
, O
and O

the O
Earth N

probably O
a O
good O
one O
. O

We H
all O
know O
the O
Earth N
is O
in O
trouble N
. O

We H
have O
now O
entered O
in O
the O
6 O
X O
: O

the O
sixth O
major O
extinction N
on O
this O
planet N

I H
think O
that O
vote N
is O
occurring O
right O
now O
. O

I H
want O
to O
present O
to O
you H
a O
suite N
of O
six O
mycological O
solutions N
, O
using O
fungi A
, O
and O
these O
solutions N
are O
based O
on O
mycelium N
. O

The O
mycelium N
infuses O
all O
landscapes N
, O
it O
holds O
soils N
together O
, O
it O
's H
extremely O
tenacious O
. O

This O
holds O
up O
to O
30,000 O
times N
its O
mass N
. O

They O
're O
the O
grand N
molecular O
disassemblers O
of O
nature N
- O
the O
soil N
magicians H
. O

They O
generate O
the O
humus N
soils N
across O
the O
landmasses N
of O
Earth N
. O

Dusty O
and O
I H
, O
we H
like O
to O
say O
, O
on O
Sunday O
, O
this O
is O
where O
we H
go O
to O
church N
. O

I H
'm O
in O
love O
with O
the O
old O
- O
growth N
forest N
, O
and O
I H
'm O
a O
patriotic O
American O
because O
we H
have O
those O
. O

Most O
of O
you H
are O
familiar O
with O
Portobello O
mushrooms A
. O

And O
frankly O
, O
I H
face O
a O
big O
obstacle N
. O

So O
, O
I H
hope O
to O
pierce O
that O
prejudice O
forever O
with O
this O
group N
. O

We H
call O
it O
mycophobia O
, O
the O
irrational O
fear N
of O
the O
unknown O
, O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
fungi A
. O

Mushrooms O
are O
very O
fast O
in O
their O
growth N
. O

Mushrooms O
produce N
strong O
antibiotics N
. O

In O
fact N
, O
we H
're O
more O
closely O
related O
to O
fungi A
than O
we H
are O
to O
any O
other O
kingdom N
. O

We H
share O
in O
common O
the O
same O
pathogens N
. O

Fungi O
don't O
do O
not O
like O
to O
rot O
from O
bacteria A
, O
and O
so O
our H
best O
antibiotics N
come O
from O
fungi A
. O

But O
here O
is O
a O
mushroom A
that O
's H
past O
its O
prime N
. O

After O
they O
sporulate O
, O
they O
do O
rot O
. O

But O
I H
propose O
to O
you H
that O
the O
sequence N
of O
microbes A
that O
occur O
on O
rotting N
mushrooms A
are O
essential O
for O
the O
health N
of O
the O
forest N
. O

They O
give O
rise N
to O
the O
trees A
, O
they O
create O
the O
debris N
fields N
that O
feed O
the O
mycelium N
. O

And O
so O
we H
see O
a O
mushroom A
here O
sporulating O
. O

And O
the O
spores N
are O
germinating O
, O
and O
the O
mycelium N
forms O
and O
goes O
underground O
. O

In O
a O
single N
cubic O
inch N
of O
soil N
, O
there O
can O
be O
more O
than O
eight O
miles N
of O
these O
cells N
. O

My H
foot N
is O
covering O
approximately O
300 O
miles N
of O
mycelium N
. O

This O
is O
photomicrographs O
from O
Nick H
Read H
and O
Patrick H
Hickey O
. O

And O
notice N
that O
as O
the O
mycelium N
grows O
, O
it O
conquers O
territory N
and O
then O
it O
begins O
the O
net N
. O

We H
exhale O
carbon N
dioxide N
, O
so O
does O
mycelium N
. O

It O
inhales O
oxygen N
, O
just O
like O
we H
do O
. O

But O
these O
are O
essentially O
externalized O
stomachs N
and O
lungs N
. O

And O
I H
present O
to O
you H
a O
concept N
that O
these O
are O
extended O
neurological O
membranes N
. O

And O
in O
these O
cavities N
, O
these O
micro O
- O
cavities N
form N
, O
and O
as O
they O
fuse O
soils N
, O
they O
absorb O
water N
. O

These O
are O
little O
wells N
. O

And O
inside O
these O
wells N
, O
then O
microbial O
communities N
begin O
to O
form N
. O

I H
first O
proposed O
, O
in O
the O
early O
1990 O
s H
, O
that O
mycelium N
is O
Earth N
's H
natural O
Internet N
. O

When O
you H
look O
at O
the O
mycelium N
, O
they O
're O
highly O
branched O
. O

The O
mycelium N
is O
sentient O
. O

It O
knows O
that O
you H
are O
there O
. O

When O
you H
walk O
across O
landscapes N
, O
it O
leaps O
up O
in O
the O
aftermath N
of O
your H
footsteps N
trying O
to O
grab O
debris N
. O

So O
, O
I H
believe O
the O
invention N
of O
the O
computer N
Internet N
is O
an O
inevitable O
consequence N
of O
a O
previously O
proven O
, O
biologically O
successful O
model N
. O

Going O
way N
out O
, O
dark O
matter N
conforms O
to O
the O
same O
mycelial O
archetype N
. O

And O
this O
is O
the O
paradigm N
that O
we H
see O
throughout O
the O
universe N
. O

Most O
of O
you H
may N
not O
know O
that O
fungi A
were O
the O
first O
organisms A
to O
come O
to O
land O
. O

They O
came O
to O
land O
1.3 O
billion O
years N
ago O
, O
and O
plants A
followed O
several O
hundred O
million O
years N
later O
. O

How O
is O
that O
possible O
? O

Makes O
the O
rocks N
crumble O
, O
and O
the O
first O
step N
in O
the O
generation N
of O
soil N
. O

Oxalic O
acid N
is O
two O
carbon N
dioxide N
molecules N
joined O
together O
. O

So O
, O
fungi A
and O
mycelium N
sequester O
carbon N
dioxide N
in O
the O
form N
of O
calcium N
oxalates N
. O

And O
all O
sorts O
of O
other O
oxalates N
are O
also O
sequestering O
carbon N
dioxide N
through O
the O
minerals N
that O
are O
being O
formed O
and O
taken O
out O
of O
the O
rock N
matrix N
. O

This O
was O
first O
discovered O
in O
1859 O
. O

This O
is O

by O
Franz H
Hueber O

This O
photograph N

taken O

in O
Saudi O
Arabia O

420 O
million O
years N
ago O
, O
this O
organism A
existed O
. O

It O
was O
called O
Prototaxites O
. O

Prototaxites O
, O
laying O
down O
, O
was O
about O
three O
feet N
tall O
. O

The O
tallest O
plants A
on O
Earth N
at O
that O
time N
were O
less O
than O
two O
feet N
. O

Across O
the O
landscapes N
of O
Earth N
were O
dotted O
these O
giant O
mushrooms A
. O

All O
across O
most O
land O
masses N
. O

And O
these O
existed O
for O
tens N
of O
millions N
of O
years N
. O

The O
Earth N
was O
struck O
by O
an O
asteroid N
, O
a O
huge O
amount N
of O
debris N
was O
jettisoned O
into O
the O
atmosphere N
. O

Sunlight N
was O
cut O
off O
, O
and O
fungi A
inherited O
the O
Earth N
. O

Those O
organisms A
that O
paired O
with O
fungi A
were O
rewarded O
, O
because O
fungi A
do O
not O
need O
light O
. O

So O
, O
the O
prospect N
of O
fungi A
existing O
on O
other O
planets N
elsewhere O
, O
I H
think O
, O
is O
a O
forgone O
conclusion N
; O

at O
least O
in O
my H
own O
mind N
. O

The O
largest O
organism A
in O
the O
world N
is O
in O
Eastern O
Oregon O
. O

2,200 O
acres N
in O
size N
, O
2,000 O
years N
old O
. O

The O
largest O
organism A
on O
the O
planet N
is O
a O
mycelial O
mat N
, O
one O
cell A
wall N
thick O
. O

The O
mycelium N
, O
in O
the O
right O
conditions N
, O
produces O
a O
mushroom A
- O
it O
bursts O
through O
with O
such O
ferocity N
that O
it O
can O
break O
asphalt N
. O

We H
were O
involved O
with O
several O
experiments N
. O

I H
'm O
going O
to O
show O
you H
six O
, O
if O
I H
can O
, O
solutions N
for O
helping O
to O
save O
the O
world N

Economists H
at O
Citigroup O

, O
Pricewaterhousecoopers O
, O
and O
elsewhere O
were O
predicting O
an O
era N
of O
broad O
and O
sustained O
growth N
from O
Asia O
to O
Africa O
. O

Third O
, O
floating O
exchange N
rates N
are O
flawed O
shock N
absorbers N
. O

It O
is O
naïve O
for O
emerging O
- O
market N
governments N
to O
expect O
major O
financial O
centers N
to O
adjust O
their O
policies N
in O
response N
to O
economic O
conditions N
elsewhere O
. O

" O
But O
the O
bottom O
line N
is O
that O
the O
ideas N
protected O
by O
IP O
rights N
are O
the O
dynamo N
of O
growth N
for O
developed O
and O
developing O
countries N

. O

It O
is O
time N

the O
positive O
role N
that O

Andy H
Haldane O
, O
one O
of O
the O
lieutenants H
Carney O
inherited O
at O
the O
BoE O
, O
has O
questioned O
the O
financial O
sector N
's H
economic O
contribution N
, O
pointing O
to O
" O
its O
ability N
to O
both O
invigorate O
and O
incapacitate O
large O
parts N
of O
the O
non O
- O
financial O
economy N
. O

The O
reasons N
for O
this O
relationship N
are O
not O
easy O
to O
establish O
definitively O
, O
and O
the O
authors H
' O
conclusions N
are O
controversial O
. O

These O
companies N
find O
it O
harder O
to O
recruit O
skilled O
graduates H
when O
financial O
firms N
can O
pay O
higher O
salaries N
. O

But O
if O
finance N
continues O
to O
take O
a O
disproportionate O
number N
of O
the O
best O
and O
the O
brightest O
, O
there O
could O
be O
little O
British O
manufacturing N
left O
by O
2050 O
, O
and O
even O
fewer O
hi-tech O
firms N
than O
today N

Physicists H
know O
that O

manifest O
themselves O

adopt O

moving O
away O

a O

How O

economies N
where O
existing O
public O
pension N
schemes N

old O

patently O
unsustainable O
? O

A O
global O
carbon N
tax N
would O
mitigate O
climate N
risks N
while O
alleviating O
government N

burdens N
. O

But O
when O
innovation N
affects O
an O
automobile N
's H
quality N
, O
the O
task N
becomes O
far O
more O
difficult O
. O

Women O

secondary O

education N
are O
more O
likely O
to O
enter O

Balzac O
had O
difficulty N
adapting O
to O
the O
rote N
style N
of O
learning N
at O
the O
school N
. O

The O
narrator H
says N
: O

Near O
the O
end N
of O
his O
life N
Balzac O
was O
captivated O
by O
the O
idea N
of O
cutting O
20,000 O
acres N
( O
81 O
Km2 O
) O
of O
oak N
wood N
in O
Ukraine O
and O
transporting O
it O
for O

in O
France O
. O

" O
When O
the O
idea N
struck O
, O
he O
raced O
to O
his O
sister H
's H
apartment N
and O
proclaimed O
: O

Although O
Balzac O
was O
a O
supporter H
of O
the O
crown N

Balzac O
paints O
the O
counter O

in O
a O
sympathetic O
light O

While O
he O
admired O
and O
drew O
inspiration N
from O
the O
Romantic O
style N
of O
Scottish O
novelist H
Walter H
Scott H
, O
Balzac O
sought O
to O
depict O
human O
existence N
through O
the O
use N
of O
particulars N
. O

Some O
critics H
consider O
Balzac O
's H
writing N
exemplary O
of O
naturalism N
- O
a O
more O
pessimistic O
and O
analytical O
form N
of O
realism N

which O
seeks O
to O
explain O
human O
behavior N

intrinsically O
linked O
