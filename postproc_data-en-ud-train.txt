Why O
very O
few O
actually O
Beat O
Bobby H
Flay O
. O

While O
it O
seems O
suspicious O
that O
Bobby H
wins O
so O
many O
of O
the O
competitions N
( O
leading N
many O
to O
think O
that O
the O
show O
is O
rigged O
) O
, O
I H
have O
a O
feeling O
that O
Bobby's O
Bobby H
's O
record N
is O
a O
product N
of O
selective O
casting N
. O

To O
explain O
: O

Remember O
when O
Anne H
Burrell O
challenged O
Bobby H
to O
a O
cheesecake N
battle N
, O
and O
won O
? O

Anne H
admitted O
it’s O
it O
’s O
not O
her O
favorite O
dish N
, O
but O
she O
knows O
that O
Bobby H
sucks O
at O
desserts N
. O

Didn't O
Did O
n't O
you H
think O
to O
yourself H
at O
the O
time N
, O
" O
Why O
hasn't O
has O
n't O
anyone O
else O
thought O
to O
do O
that O
? O
" O

I H
bet N
they O
have O
. O

I H
bet N
lots N
of O
people N
have O
. O

But O
to O
ensure O
that O
Bobby H
maintains O
a O
favorable O
batting N
average O
( O
and O
therefore O
looks O
good O
/ O
stays N
happy O
on O
the O
show O
) O
, O
the O
producers H
ask O
what O
chefs H
intend O
to O
cook O
as O
their O
signature N
dish N
in O
the O
audition N
process N
, O
and O
then O
only O
pick O
challengers H
who O
either O
a) O
, O
are O
going O
to O
cook O
something O
that's O
that O
's O
already O
in O
Bobby's O
Bobby H
's O
wheelhouse N
( O
how O
many O
times N
have O
we H
seen O
that O
happen O
? O
) O
, O
or O
b) O
, O
are O
going O
to O
cook O
something O
unique O
, O
but O
it's O
it O
's O
an O
irregular O
( O
or O
just O
plain O
stupid O
) O
version N
of O
that O
unique O
thing N
. O

Given O
that O
when O
confronted O
with O
a O
dish N
unfamiliar O
to O
him O
, O
Bobby H
always O
prepares O
a O
straightforward O
version N
, O
Bobby's O
Bobby H
's O
earnest N
dish N
will O
usually O
win O
out O
over O
the O
platter N
of O
WHUT O
put O
out O
by O
the O
challenger O
. O

Don’t O
Do O
n’t O
take O
my H
word N
for O
it O
, O
just O
watch O
the O
show O
. O

Usually O
when O
the O
challenger O
announces O
their O
dish N
you H
think O
to O
yourself H
, O
“ O
oh O
Bobby’s O
Bobby H
’s O
screwed O
on O
this O
one N
, O
” O
but O
then O
immediately O
they O
cut O
to O
that O
interview N
where O
a O
smiling O
, O
imbecilic O
contender H
says O
, O
“ O
My H
version N
of O
________ O
has O
... O
[ O
some O
looney O
goddamn O
ingredient N
or O
technique N
that O
doesn’t O
does O
n’t O
belong O
in O
that O
dish N
] O
. O
” O

And O
then O
they O
are O
oh O
- O
so O
- O
surprised O
at O
the O
end N
of O
the O
show O
when O
their O
inane O
concoction N
gets O
clobbered O
by O
Mr. N
Flay O
. O

BTW O
if O
you’re O
you H
’re O
still O
doubtful O
, O
the O
producers H
HAVE O
to O
know O
the O
secret O
in O
advance N
. O

There’s O
There O
’s O
no O
way N
they’re O
they O
’re O
stopping O
production N
while O
a O
P.A. N
runs O
out O
to O
buy O
liver N
& O
onions N
. O

Which O
brings O
me H
back O
to O
Anne H
Burrell O
and O
her O
cheesecake N
. O

Celebrity H
chefs H
win O
against O
Bobby H
more O
often O
because O
they O
are O
who O
they O
are O
, O
and O
they O
can O
cook O
whatever O
they O
want O
to O
. O

The O
producers H
are O
just O
happy O
to O
have O
them O
on O
the O
show O
, O
and O
when O
Bobby H
loses O
to O
them O
it O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
look O
as O
bad O
. O

This O
also O
illuminates O
why O
we H
so O
often O
see O
judges H
who O
themselves O
have O
a O
background N
in O
whatever O
the O
signature N
dish N
is O
. O

If O
the O
producers H
know O
what O
the O
challenger O
is O
going O
to O
cook O
, O
they O
can O
bring O
in O
judges H
who O
know O
how O
it's O
it O
's O
supposed O
to O
be O
cooked O
( O
and O
also O
importantly O
, O
know O
that O
it's O
it O
's O
not O
supposed O
to O
be O
cooked O
in O
whatever O
godforsaken O
manner N
than O
the O
challenger O
plans N
) O
. O

One O
final O
thing N
: O

Though O
I’m O
I H
’m O
inclined O
to O
believe O
that O
Bobby H
doesn’t O
does O
n’t O
actually O
know O
what O
the O
signature N
dish N
will O
be O
( O
even O
though O
the O
producers H
do O
) O
, O
I H
wouldn’t O
would O
n’t O
be O
too O
terribly O
surprised O
if O
one N
of O
his O
assistants H
or O
sous N
- O
chefs H
has O
been O
told O
the O
dish N
and O
has O
“ O
seeded O
” O
Bobby’s O
Bobby H
’s O
pantry N
with O
ideas N
. O

I’m O
I H
’m O
sure O
it’s O
it O
’s O
always O
well O
- O
stocked O
, O
but O
c’m O
on O
... O
it O
can’t O
ca O
n’t O
hold O
more O
than O
a O
fraction N
of O
what’s O
what O
’s O
in O
the O
supermarket N
. O

So O
when O
Bobby H
looks O
and O
sees O
a O
bottle N
of O
, O
say O
, O
pomegranate A
molasses N
that’s O
that O
’s O
not O
normally O
there O
, O
that’s O
that O
’s O
his O
clue N
. O

“ O
Oh O
yeah O
, O
a O
gastrique O
would O
work N
really O
well O
here O
. O
” O

This O
might O
seem O
a O
bit N
shady O
, O
but O
it O
doesn’t O
does O
n’t O
conflict N
directly O
with O
anything O
the O
show O
tells O
you H
about O
how O
it O
works O
. O

And O
that O
, O
my H
friends H
, O
is O
“ O
reality N
” O
TV N
. O

The O
producers H
most O
definitely O
know O
. O

How O
else O
do O
they O
always O
find O
judges H
that O
are O
experts H
in O
that O
type N
of O
cuisine N
to O
judge H
the O
competition N
? O

While O
I H
do O
think O
Bobby H
Flay O
is O
actually O
that O
good O
( O
regardless O
of O
how O
cocky O
he O
can O
appear O
) O
, O
I H
do O
agree O
with O
you H
that O
the O
competitor H
tends O
to O
be O
their O
own O
worst O
enemy N
. O

I H
feel O
like O
they O
always O
go O
overboard O
with O
their O
dish N
to O
try O
and O
wow O
the O
judges H
that O
they O
forget O
they O
simply O
just O
need O
to O
beat O
Bobby’s O
Bobby H
’s O
dish N
. O

Bobby H
takes O
the O
dish N
and O
just O
makes O
sure O
all O
the O
flavors N
and O
textures N
are O
there O
while O
the O
competitor H
tries O
to O
make O
the O
dish N
more O
unique O
and O
their O
own O
. O

It O
rarely O
works O
. O

I've O
I H
've O
always O
thought O
of O
Bobby H
Flay O
as O
an O
arrogant O
douche N
, O
but O
the O
tiramisu N
episode N
of O
BBF O
confirmed O
that O
he O
is O
a O
douche N
. O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
tiramisu N
challenge N
, O
he O
decided O
to O
make O
4 O
cheeseburgers N
from O
scratch N
just O
for O
fun O
to O
eat O
during O
. O

Fuck O
that O
. O

That O
was O
so O
disrespectful O
to O
the O
challenger O
pastry N
chef H
. O

so O
happy O
Amanda H
won O
though O
! O

love O
when O
I H
see O
people N
/ O
places N
from O
Austin O
on O
FN O
:) O

From O
binge N
watching O
this O
show O
the O
past N
week N
, O
it’s O
it O
’s O
clear N
that O
Bobby H
has O
advance N
knowledge N
of O
what O
he O
might O
face N
. O

Recall O
that O
Iron O
Chef O
also O
wasn’t O
was O
n’t O
a O
total N
surprise O
as O
to O
the O
featured O
ingredient N
. O

PS N
- O
Good O
analysis N
from O
OP O
. O

Bobby H
has O
never O
made O
anything O
that O
the O
competition N
challenges N
him O
too O
. O

He O
just O
makes O
a O
completely O
different O
dish N
and O
calls O
it O
a O
Southwest O
version N
of O
whatever O
he O
was O
supposed O
to O
make O
. O

bobby O
flay O
is O
an O
iron N
chef H
for O
a O
reason N
. O

he O
is O
going O
up O
against O
mostly O
home N
cooks H
or O
restaurant N
chefs H
. O

while O
i H
do O
agree O
that O
they O
do O
selective O
casting N
, O
which O
all O
shows N
do O
anyways O
for O
entertainment N
purposes N
, O
i H
do O
believe O
that O
he O
is O
that O
good O
. O

The O
producers H
know O
, O
but O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
think O
they're O
they O
're O
actively O
try O
and O
push O
the O
scales N
against O
Bobby H
. O

They O
want O
the O
competetors H
to O
cook O
their O
own O
signature N
dish N
because O
that's O
that O
's O
interesting O
- O
it's O
it O
's O
the O
premise N
of O
the O
show O
. O

The O
best O
that O
some O
" O
average O
" O
chef H
has O
to O
offer O
vs O
some O
side N
dish N
produced O
by O
a O
master O
chef H
. O

When O
you're O
you H
're O
a O
celebrity N
chef H
, O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
really O
have O
a O
single O
singular N
dish N
. O

You H
can O
cook O
everything O
, O
and O
maybe O
specialize O
in O
a O
few O
fields N
. O

So O
when O
master O
chefs H
go O
against O
Bobby H
, O
they O
can O
just O
whip O
out O
something O
they O
know O
they're O
they O
're O
probably O
better O
than O
him O
at O
. O

Emergency N
Callout O
: O
Customer H
crushed O
without O
important O
data N
! O

I H
just O
saw O
a O
post N
making O
mention N
of O
a O
similar O
situation N
which O
reminded O
me H
of O
this O
, O
and O
thought O
you H
guys H
might O
get O
a O
giggle N
/ O
facepalm O
out O
of O
it O
. O

I H
do O
device N
repairs N
& O
technical O
support N
for O
quite O
a O
few O
families N
and O
businesses N
locally O
, O
and O
a O
couple N
of O
years N
back O
received O
an O
emergency N
call O
. O

The O
owner H
of O
one N
of O
the O
businesses N
I H
support N
had O
purchased O
a O
new O
phone N
and O
needed O
to O
know O
how O
to O
transfer H
important O
data N
to O
it O
from O
her O
old O
phone N
. O

I H
order O
a O
taxi N
, O
grab O
my H
laptop N
and O
head N
out O
. O

It O
turned O
out O
the O
" O
important O
data N
" O
was O
her O
Candy O
Crush O
progress N
, O
but O
she O
didn't O
did O
n't O
let O
me H
know O
this O
until O
I H
arrived O
. O

I H
tried O
to O
make O
light N
of O
it O
- O
I H
wasn't O
was O
n't O
particularly O
amused O
at O
having O
my H
evening N
interrupted O
for O
this O
- O
and O
deadly O
serious O
, O
she O
snapped O
back O
that O
it O
was O
important O
because O
she O
was O
trying O
to O
give O
up O
smoking O
and O
she O
needed O
it O
to O
relax O
during O
work N
breaks O
. O

I H
looked O
up O
how O
to O
do O
it O
( O
via O
Facebook O
account O
, O
it O
turns N
out O
; O
she O
had O
never O
logged O
in O
on O
the O
old O
phone N
) O
, O
transferred O
the O
data N
over O
and O
charged O
her O
double O
time N
for O
the O
post-5pm O
call O
out O
. O

If O
they're O
they O
're O
paying O
emergency N
rates N
, O
I'd O
I H
'd O
take O
a O
trivial O
job N
as O
a O
freebie N
compared O
to O
the O
usual O
stakes N
. O

Those O
tend O
to O
come O
with O
" O
We're O
We H
're O
losing O
$ O
X,000 O
per O
hour N
while O
this O
is O
ongoing O
, O
fix O
it O
" O
levels N
of O
pressure O
. O

Yeah O
, O
the O
rates N
stopped O
me H
from O
being O
pissed O
off O
with O
her O
. O

Also O
grabbed O
a O
takeaway N
( O
takeout N
for O
our H
American O
readers H
) O
on O
the O
way N
home N
, O
which O
was O
a O
bonus N
. O

Gave O
me H
a O
kind N
of O
existential O
" O
Do O
I H
really O
mean O
that O
little O
to O
my H
customers H
? O
" O
thing N
when O
I H
got O
back O
, O
though O
. O

You H
mean O
exactly O
as O
much O
as O
you H
charge O
. O

Our H
firm O
raised O
our H
rates N
recently O
by O
30 O
% O
and O
lost O
3 O
- O
7 O
% O
of O
our H
clients H
because O
we H
were O
" O
too O
expensive O
" O
. O

We're O
We H
're O
now O
charging O
hourly O
for O
the O
miscellaneous O
things N
clients H
brought O
to O
us H
vs O
per O
project N
completed O
and O
the O
tiny O
little O
shitty O
projects N
we're O
we H
're O
doiong O
now O
has O
decreased O
. O

Yep O
, O
it's O
it O
's O
far O
wiser O
to O
be O
slightly O
over O
market N
rates N
when O
contracting N
. O

You H
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
the O
people N
barely O
willing O
to O
pay O
market N
rates N
as O
customers H
, O
they O
are O
often O
unreasonably O
demanding O
and O
see O
normal O
rates N
as O
crazy O
high O
. O

The O
people N
who O
won't O
wo O
n't O
mind N
paying O
a O
little O
more O
can O
usually O
afford O
it O
fine O
, O
don't O
do O
n't O
fret O
over O
it O
, O
and O
tend O
to O
treat O
you H
better O
. O

It's O
It O
's O
slightly O
uncomfortable O
to O
have O
conversations N
about O
new O
prices N
, O
but O
if O
you H
want O
to O
work N
less O
for O
more O
and O
be O
treated O
a O
little O
better O
- O
it's O
it O
's O
worth N
it O
. O

Woah O
, O
and O
I H
get O
a O
comment O
from O
the O
Bytewave O
. O

Hope O
all O
is O
well O
in O
your H
world N
, O
I H
feel O
like O
I H
know O
you H
so O
well O
despite O
never O
actually O
speaking O
to O
you H
! O

Hope O
you H
are O
still O
enjoying O
not O
working O
for O
the O
silly O
telecom N
, O
even O
though O
I H
miss O
the O
stories N

That's O
That O
's O
really O
heartwarming O
to O
read O
. O

I H
changed O
a O
bit N
since O
I H
wrote O
here O
, O
and O
my H
life N
has O
as O
well O
- O
but O
I H
do O
miss O
writing N
these O
stories N
, O
to O
be O
honest O
. O

They O
were O
really O
cathartic O
. O

I H
really O
appreciated O
all O
the O
support N
you H
guys H
gave O
me H
, O
I H
was O
getting O
bored O
with O
my H
work N
and O
sharing N
the O
highlights O
of O
it's O
history N
made O
it O
fun O
again O
for O
a O
time N
. O

Though O
I H
had O
reasons N
to O
take O
a O
long O
break O
, O
it O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
lack N
of O
material O
per O
se O
... O

So O
I'm O
I H
'm O
still O
not O
saying O
I H
won't O
wo O
n't O
be O
back O
someday O
:) O

The O
answer N
is O
yes O

Every O

Your H

ABSOLUTELY O
less O
important O

someone H
else's O

Ive O

ve O

who O

because O

want O

which O
is O
something O
I H
was O
taught O
at O
a O
young O
age N
, O
to O
fend O
for O
myself H
. O

I H
feel O
like O
the O
two O
are O
connected O
psychologically O
and O
id O
i H
d O
love O
to O
see O
behavioral O

solutions N

the O
behavior N

I H
totally O
relate O

this O

People N
just O
can't O

n't O
copy N
- O
paste O
stuff N
from O
one N
cell N
in O
an O
excel O
file N
to O
another O
cell N
because O
it O
can O
be O
automated O
. O

why O
don't O
do O
n't O
you H
do O
that O
as O
well O
? O

Really O
, O
it O
takes O
quite O
an O
effort N
to O
not O
roll O
my H
eyes N
and O
tell O
them O
to O
move O
on O
because O
I've O
I H
've O
got O
more O
work N
prioritised O
than O
automating O
something O
that O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
even O
take O
a O
wink N

This O
is O
not O
really O
frequent O

hats N
off O

You've O

My H
wife H
and O
I H
were O
at O
Panera O
eating O
breakfast N
and O
we H
noticed O
a O
lady H
be O
hind O
us H
talking O
on O
the O
phone N
very O
loudly O
. O

We H
couldn’t O
could O

help O
over O
hearing O
her O
talk O
about O
a O
bill N

paid O

We H
were O
a O
little O
annoyed O
but O
not O
a O
big O
deal O
because O
it O
was O
a O
public O
restaurant N

We H
were O
not O
trying O
to O
listen O
but O
were O
shocked O
when O
she O
announced O
that O
she O
was O
about O
to O
read O
her O
card N
number N

She O
then O
gave O
the O
card’s O
card N
’s O
expiration N
date N
, O
security N
code N

and O
her O
zip N
code N

We H
clearly O
heard O
and O
if O
we H
were O
planning O
on O
stealing O
it O
she O
gave O
us H
plenty O
of O
notice O
to O
get O
a O
pen N

you H

Well O
unfortunately O
, O
some O
companies N
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
very O
good O

Wish O
it O
was O
the O

Some O

but O
I H
think O
we H
see O
that O
the O

still O

So O
largely O
it O

less O

Which O
conspiracy N

so O

that O
it O

? O

That O

constantly O
" O

its O
it O

listening O

Most O
glaring O
instance N
where O
this O
happened O
to O
me H
was O
when O
I H
walked O
into O
a O
colleagues H
colleague H

office N

He O
had O
just O
gotten O
a O
standing N
desk N

but O
one N
that O
goes O
on O
top N
of O
his O
existing O
desk N
rather O
than O
a O
standalone O
( O
pun N
? O
) O
Model N

That's O
That O
's O
important O
to O
note N

I H
said O
" O
Nice O

when O
did O
you H
get O
that O
? O
" O
. O

" O
Thanks N

just O
today N

" O
He O
replied O
. O

That O
was O
literally O
all O
that O
was O
said O
about O
the O
desk N
. O

We H
talked O
about O
work N
related O
stuff N
and O
as O
I H
walked O
out O
and O
checked O
my H
phone N
, O
there O
was O
an O
ad O
on O
Facebook O
for O
that O
EXACT O
model N
of O
standing N
desk N

I H
have O
never O
owned O
one N
, O
wanted O
one N

one N
before O

Yet O
there O
it O

I've O
I H

happen O
to O
me H
twice O
in O
the O
last O

Things N
I H
talked O
about O
with O

never O

anything O
about O
hard O

Weird O
af O

I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
remember O
the O
first O
one N

When O
I H
said O
something O
to O
my H
daughter H
about O
it O
after O
the O
first O
time N
, O
she O
called O
me H
crazy O
. O

When O
I H
showed O
her O
the O
egg A
thing N

she O
said O
, O
well O
damn O
.... O
you H
might O
be O
right O
! O

This O
has O
happened O
to O
me H
multiple O
times N
! O

The O
time N
that O
really O
seals A
the O
deal O
for O
me H
is O
when O
my H
mother H
asked O
me H
to O
be O
a O
surrogate H
for O
her O
( O
which O
was O
heavily O
declined O
, O
as O
she O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
need O
any O
more O
children H
to O
ruin N
) O
one N
day N
while O
over O
my H
house N

It O
was O
either O
later O
on O
or O
the O
next O
day N
that O
I H
was O
telling O
my H
boyfriend H
about O
how O
ridiculous O
it O
was O
for O
her O
to O
be O
asking O
me H
to O
be O
a O
surrogate H
. O

Low N

behold O
, O
scrolling O
through O
Facebook O
I H
get O
an O
ad O
that O
says O
" O
become O

Never O

I H
said O
the O

a O
few O
months N

after O

cases N

She O
had O
claimed O
that O
she O

not O

April O

investigating O
these O

on O
February O
23 O

dead O

Another O
journalist H
she O
had O
accused O
of O
pedophilia N
on O
the O
airing N

Luis H
Ventura H

had O
uploaded O
an O

herself O
on O
Twitter O

then O
promptly O
deleted O
it O
afterwards O

To O
quote N
u/happycakeday1 O
She O
supposedly O
died O
from O
a O
cocaine N
overdose O
( O
heart N
failure N

stroke N

She O
had O
said O
that O
if O
she O
wound N
up O
dead O
, O
the O
people N
she O
had O
accused O
of O
rape N
( O
she O
was O
on O
trial N

it O

would O

guilty O

" O
I H

If O
she O

all O

yeah O
, O
she O
was O
most O

does O

it O

someone H

Tyrannosaurus O
Rex O
had O
wings N

Not O
big O
wings N
to O
fly O

but O
wings N
that O
were O

somthing O

of O

although O
likely O
much O
smaller O
in O

Ostriches H
use O
their O

mating N

to O
make O

appear O
larger O

T H

They O
did O

This O
just O

my H

I H
hope O
this O

CMV O
: O
We H
should O
keep O
assuming O
others’ O
others O
’ O
gender N
and O
pronouns N
, O
but O
be O
respectful O
if O
corrected O

Democratic O
society N
operates O
according O
to O
“ O
majority N
rule N
, O
minority N
rights N
. O
” O

We H
should O
strive O
for O
equality N
, O
but O
also O
practicality N
. O

Thus O
, O
our H
current O
gender N
system N
should O
only O
be O
tweaked O
, O
not O
radically O
changed O
. O

Societal O
norms N
are O
set O
by O
the O
majority N
. O

Since O
most O
people N
are O
cisgender O
( O
and O
heterosexual O
) O
, O
norms N
reflect O
that O
. O

This O
isn’t O
is O
n’t O
inherently O
an O
issue N
. O

It’s O
It O
’s O
only O
when O
we H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
tolerate O
deviation N
from O
norms N
that O
it O
becomes O
a O
problem N
. O

It’s O
It O
’s O
neither O
necessary O
, O
possible O
, O
nor O
desirable O
to O
erase O
all O
gender N
norms N
, O
since O
they O
are O
willingly O
followed O
by O
most O
. O

The O
vast O
majority N
of O
people N
, O
cis O
or O
trans O
, O
identify O
as O
male O
or O
female O
, O
and O
have O
an O
appearance N
that O
matches O
. O

This O
makes O
our H
binary N
gender N
assumption N
norms N
useful O
. O

Most O
people N
want O
their O
gender N
assumed O
off O
appearance N
or O
else O
don’t O
do O
n’t O
care N
; O
it’s O
it O
’s O
only O
a O
very O
few O
whose O
appearance N
doesn’t O
does O
n’t O
match O
gender N
, O
or O
identify O
as O
a O
non-binary O
gender N
. O

Society N
already O
accommodates O
situations N
like O
this O
. O

We H
provide O
wheelchair N
ramps N
, O
nut N
- O
free O
foods N
, O
and O
gender N
neutral O
bathrooms N
on O
top N
of O
the O
stairs N
, O
PB&J O
, O
and O
gendered O
bathrooms N
that O
most O
people N
use O
. O

You H
might O
have O
to O
ask O
someone H
or O
travel O
a O
bit N
more O
to O
be O
accommodated O
, O
but O
society N
has O
deemed O
this O
small O
extra O
effort N
acceptable O
, O
because O
very O
few O
people N
need O
to O
be O
accommodated O
. O

It’s O
It O
’s O
thus O
reasonable O
to O
expect O
the O
individual O
to O
request N
certain O
pronouns N
if O
it’s O
it O
’s O
important O
to O
them O
. O

Society N
recognizes O
disabilities N
, O
allergies N
, O
and O
even O
hard O
to O
pronounce O
names N
as O
legitimate O
. O

The O
root N
issue N
is O
that O
non-conforming O
genders N
aren’t O
are O
n’t O
always O
recognized O
as O
legitimate O
, O
and O
harassment N
of O
the O
group N
occurs O
. O

No O
one N
says O
to O
a O
person H
who O
says O
they O
have O
an O
allergy N
“ O
Really O
? O
You H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
look O
like O
you H
have O
an O
allergy N
? O
” O

We H
all O
need O
to O
be O
educated O
and O
tolerant O
towards O
other O
pronouns N
and O
genders N
, O
and O
not O
tolerate O
harassment N
of O
this O
group N
. O

Basically O
, O
recognize O
your H
assumptions N
aren’t O
are O
n’t O
always O
correct O
, O
and O
be O
gracious O
if O
you’re O
you H
’re O
wrong O
. O

It’s O
It O
’s O
a O
waste O
of O
time N
and O
effort N
to O
make O
everyone O
ask O
or O
introduce O
pronouns N
or O
gender N
, O
because O
most O
people N
don’t O
do O
n’t O
care N
. O

You H
should O
feel O
free O
to O
do O
this O
if O
you H
want O
to O
, O
but O
otherwise O
, O
you H
have O
to O
live O
with O
reasonable O
assumptions N
. O

This O
solution N
is O
much O
more O
practical O
, O
and O
much O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
implemented O
and O
accepted O
by O
everyone O
. O

In O
essence N
, O
make O
an O
assumption N
, O
if O
you H
find O
out O
otherwise O
, O
go O
with O
it O
. O

This O
isn’t O
is O
n’t O
difficult O
or O
a O
big O
deal O
. O

As O
far O
as O
ethics N
and O
economics N
are O
concerned O
, O
this O
solution N
is O
the O
best O
one N
. O

CMV O
, O
I’d O
I H
’d O
be O
glad O
to O
discuss O
parts N
of O
the O
solution N
you H
take O
issue N
with O
in O
more O
detail N

I H
generally O
agree O
with O
this O
, O
but O
it O
is O
context N
sensitive O
. O

If O
you H
are O
at O
a O
venue N
where O
you H
are O
asked O
to O
introduce O
yourself H
and O
your H
pronouns N
, O
it O
is O
churlish O
to O
refuse O
to O
do O
so O
, O
AND O
in O
that O
context N
it’s O
it O
’s O
best O
to O
ask O
rather O
that O
assume O
. O

Since O
that O
kind N
of O
venue N
is O
fairly O
rare O
, O
it O
is O
not O
an O
unusual O
burden N
to O
‘ O
go O
with O
the O
flow N
’ O
. O

I H
organize O
events N
professionally O
, O
and O
have O
never O
included O
as O
part N
of O
introductions N
. O

The O
number N
of O
people N
who O
are O
uncomfortable O
with O
the O
practice O
exceeds O
the O
number N
of O
people N
who O
prefer O
asking O
. O

In O
issues N
of O
human O
decency N
‘ O
majority N
rules N
’ O
is O
not O
the O
rule N
of O
thumb N
. O

But O
I H
do O
think O
asking O
for O
pronouns N
/ O
not O
assuming O
gender N
will O
remain O
a O
fairly O
fringe O
activity N
that O
you H
find O
in O
a O
few O
colleges N
, O
churches N
, O
support N
groups N
and O
therapy N
contexts N
and O
not O
much O
outside O
of O
that O
. O

I H
would O
agree O
wholeheartedly O
that O
in O
certain O
contexts N
, O
this O
makes O
sense N
. O

I H
think O
the O
key N
is O
that O
you’d O
you H
’d O
be O
informed O
about O
it O
, O
like O
if O
you’re O
you H
’re O
going O
to O
an O
LBGT O
or O
transgender O
event N
, O
obviously O
you H
might O
want O
to O
be O
more O
careful O
. O

If O
everyone O
is O
expected O
to O
introduce O
their O
pronouns N
in O
the O
venue N
, O
then O
you H
may O
as O
well O
follow O
suit N
. O

As O
I’ve O
I H
’ve O
said O
, O
though O
, O
I H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
think O
it O
would O
be O
best O
to O
apply O
this O
idea N
society N
- O
wide O
though O
. O

Exactly O
. O

There’s O
There O
’s O
a O
time N
and O
a O
place N
for O
everything O
and O
a O
majority N
of O
people N
use O
pronouns N
based O
on O
their O
assigned O
gender N
. O

Gender N
dysphoria N
is O
not O
a O
common O
thing N
but O
knowing O
when O
you H
will O
encounter N
a O
higher O
concentration N
of O
people N
who O
are O
transgender O
should O
be O
key N
in O
determining O
your H
behavior N
. O

Classic O
“ O
know O
your H
audience N
” O
type N
of O
thing N
. O

I H
can’t O
ca O
n’t O
even O
remember O
names N
of O
people N
I H
meet O
. O

I H
guess O
I’d O
I H
’d O
have O
to O
take O
a O
notebook N
to O
such O
an O
event N
to O
remember O
names N
and O
pronouns N
. O

Oh O
and O
a O
Polaroid O
camera N
to O
remember O
who O
they O
belong O
to O
lol O
. O

I H
think O
if O
you’re O
you H
’re O
at O
a O
place N
where O
people N
provide O
preferred O
pronouns N
at O
introduction N
you’re O
you H
’re O
skipping O
the O
part N
that O
necessitates O
assumption N
. O

I've O
I H
've O
been O
more O

I H
reasonably O
have O
ZERO O

there O
is O
a O
real O

the O
other O
thing N
that O
really O
works O
for O

Agreed O
- O
am O
a O
serious O
introvert H
, O
but O
my H
life N
would O
be O
way N
less O
fullfilling O
and O
way N
less O
rich O
with O
great O
life N
experiences N
in O
the O
realm N
of O
friends H
, O
partying O
, O
girls H
, O
etc O
if O
I H
hadn't O
had O
n't O
made O
a O
conscious O
effort N
get O
good O
at O
behaving O
in O
a O
more O
extroverted O
manner N
enough O
of O
the O
time N
to O
have O
the O
experiences N
I H
want O
to O
be O
a O
part N
of O
my H
life N
. O

Obviously O
different O
people N
have O
different O
priorities N
, O
and O
it O
isn't O
is O
n't O
something O
that O
will O
work N
or O
be O
possible O
for O
everyone O
. O

But O
I H
hate O
to O
think O
of O
someone H
just O
being O
like O
, O
" O
I'm O
I H
'm O
an O
introvert H
, O
and O
therefore O
I H
need O
to O
accept O
that O
I H
will O
never O
have O
the O
experience N
of O
being O
a O
charismatic O
fun O
person H
who O
is O
good O
with O
people N
and O
the O
opposite N
sex N
. O
" O
, O
and O
not O
even O
trying O
to O
make O
those O
things N
happen O
, O
if O
that O
is O
something O
they O
would O
like O
in O
their O
life N
. O

In O
terms N
of O
dating O
, O
it O
is O
nice O
to O
find O
someone H
, O
as O
I H
have O
been O
fortunate O
enough O
to O
, O
who O
is O
on O
the O
same O
page N
in O
terms N
of O
being O
an O
introvert H
, O
who O
also O
likes O
to O
sometimes O
be O
social O
, O
party N
, O
etc. O

But O
I H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
have O
found O
that O
person H
if O
at O
the O
time N
that O
we H
met O
I H
hadn't O
had O
n't O
been O
making O
a O
real O
effort N
to O
be O
outgoing O
and O
fun O
and O
so O
on O
. O

I H
think O
the O
big O
thing N
is O
people N
assume O
introvert H
= O
poor O
people N
skills N
. O

There O
are O
a O
lot N
of O
introverts H
that O
are O
super O
fun O
and O
cool O
people N
that O
can O
talk O
and O
do O
whatever O
and O
plenty O
of O
extroverts H
that O
are O
awkard O
and O
get O
anxious O
in O
social O
situations N
. O

The O
difference N
is O
wether O
you H
become O
drained O
or O
energized O
when O
doing O
it O

To O
be O
fair O
, O
as O
far O
as O
my H
own O
experience N
goes O
, O
that O
assumption N
is O
not O
entirely O
without O
merits N
. O

People N
skills N
are O
skills N
, O
learned O
and O
maintained O
through O
use O
- O
be O
introverted O
enough O
that O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
do O
either O
of O
these O
and O
at O
some O
point N
your H
social O
skills N
are O
probably O
going O
to O
suffer O
. O

Obviously O
not O
true O
for O
every O
introvert H
but O
I H
feel O
like O
the O
assumption N
that O
every O
introvert H
is O
secretly O
socially O
awesome O
, O
funny O
and O
overall O
the O
life N
of O
the O
party N
but O
just O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
want O
to O
right O
now O
can O
be O

well O

Devices N

Polygraph N
and O
other O
deception N
detection N
devices N
. O

First O
, O
this O
is O
not O
me H
telling O
you H
how O
to O
beat O
polygraph N
( O
poly O
. O
) O

When O
taking O
the O
test N
, O
it O
is O
common O
for O
the O
examiner H
to O
ask O
if O
you H
have O
researched O
how O
to O
pass O
the O
poly O
deceptively O
. O

So O
, O
if O
you H
read O
this O
, O
understand O
that O
I H
am O
not O
going O
to O
tell O
you H
how O
to O
beat O
the O
test N
. O

It O
is O
also O
worth N
mentioning O
that O
doing O
something O
like O
that O
is O
, O
generally O
, O
a O
bad O
idea N
. O

Second O
, O
let’s O
let O
’s H
just O
get O
something O
out O
of O
the O
way N
. O

A O
polygraph N
is O
not O
admissible O
in O
criminal O
court N
, O
and O
for O
good O
reason N
. O

It O
is O
not O
going O
to O
give O
us H
specific O
information N
. O

There O
have O
been O
people N
who O
have O
lied O
and O
not O
shown O
deception N
. O

There O
are O
some O
people N
who O
showed O
deception N
, O
who O
were O
not O
necessarily O
lying O
. O

Having O
said O
that O
, O
it O
is O
still O
a O
great O
tool N
for O
verifying O
truthfulness N
, O
and O
I’m O
I H
’m O
a O
big O
fan N
of O
using O
it O
in O
this O
kind N
of O
a O
process N
. O

Hopefully O
I H
can O
explain O
to O
you H
why O
that O
happens O
here O
. O

All O
of O
these O
Deception N
Detection N
Devices N
( O
DDD O
) O
work N
on O
a O
basic O
principal O
. O

Your H
body N
has O
involuntary O
and O
automatic O
responses N
to O
lying O
. O

Basically O
, O
you H
are O
afraid O
of O
getting O
caught O
. O

No O
matter N
how O
little O
, O
there O
is O
still O
a O
bit N
of O
everyone O
that O
hopes N
we H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
get O
caught O
. O

The O
fact N
that O
you’re O
you H
’re O
hooked O
up O
to O
the O
machine N
really O
tends O
to O
amplify O
this O
. O

These O
machines N
are O
actually O
fear N
detectors N
. O

They O
measure N
your H
body’s O
body N
’s H
reaction N
to O
fear N
, O
like O
your H
heart N
rate N
increasing O
or O
changing O
just O
to O
name N
one N
. O

So O
how O
does O
a O
truthful O
person H
show O
deception N
? O

Let O
me H
show O
you H
. O

20 O
years N
ago O
, O
an O
applicant H
… O
let’s O
let O
’s H
call O
him O
Joe H
… O
was O
out O
with O
friends H
at O
a O
bar N
. O

While O
there O
he O
was O
approached O
by O
a O
prostitute H
who O
offered O
him O
her O
services N
. O

Joe H
, O
being O
the O
fine O
and O
upstanding O
individual O
he O
is O
, O
turned O
her O
down O
. O

On O
his O
background N
paperwork N
he O
indicated O
that O
he O
had O
never O
paid O
anyone O
for O
sex N
and O
he O
has O
never O
sought O
to O
pay O
anyone O
for O
sex N
… O

both O
are O
true O
. O

However O
, O
Joe H
has O
a O
flash N
of O
a O
thought O
from O
that O
night N
when O
the O
examiner H
asks O
him O
if O
he O
has O
paid O
for O
sex N
. O

His O
body N
, O
automatically O
, O
is O
afraid O
that O
he O
should O
have O
said O
something O
. O

The O
machine N
will O
pick O
that O
reaction N
up O
. O

The O
reason N
this O
isn't O
is O
n't O
scientific O
is O
because O
just O
because O
it O
shows N
deception N
on O
a O
particular O
subject O
, O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
mean O
you’re O
you H
’re O
lying O
… O

it O
means N
that O
there O
is O
usually O
more O
to O
that O
story N
. O

To O
combat O
this O
, O
before O
you H
take O
the O
poly O
you H
will O
talk O
with O
the O
examiner H
and O
go O
over O
every O
question N
that O
is O
on O
the O
exam N
. O

That O
way N
you H
can O
address N
any O
gray O
areas N
. O

You H
may O
have O
answered O
a O
question N
in O
your H
background N
with O
a O
“ O
no O
” O
answer N
, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
“ O
comma N
, O
but O
” O
to O
it O
though O
… O
if O
you H
know O
what O
I H
mean O
. O

Make O
sure O
that O
you H
address N
any O
of O
these O
areas N
with O
the O
background N
investigator H
and O
with O
the O
polygraph N
examiner H
before O
taking O
the O
test N
. O

That O
way N
, O
you’ll O
you H
’ll O
feel O
that O
it’s O
it O
’s H
been O
addressed O
and O
it O
is O
much O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
a O
non-issue N
. O

Third O
, O
please O
know O
that O
common O
sense N
is O
still O
very O
much O
on O
the O
table N
. O

Have O
you H
seen O
the O
scene N
from O
Ocean’s O
Ocean O
’s H
Eleven O
where O
the O
“ O
smart O
guy H
” O
is O
undergoing O
a O
polygraph N
so O
he O
can O
get O
the O
casino N
job N
? O

They O
put O
a O
thumb N
tack N
in O
his O
shoe N
so O
that O
when O
he O
could O
poke O
his O
foot N
on O
the O
truthful O
answers N
and O
not O
on O
the O
lies N
. O

That O
way N
he O
was O
consistent O
through O
the O
exam N
. O

He O
was O
always O
stressed O
. O

The O
examiner H
even O
makes O
the O
comment O
that O
“ O
man H
to O
look O
at O
him O
, O
I H
would O
swear O
he’s O
he O
’s H
being O
deceptive O
. O
” O

Well O
, O
first O
… O
the O
thumb N
tack N
trick N
doesn't O
does O
n't O
work N
… O

don’t O
do O
n’t O
try O
it O
. O

You’ll O
You H
’ll O
end N
up O
with O
a O
hurt O
foot N
, O
and O
deception N
everywhere O
. O

Second O
, O
the O
human O
element N
will O
be O
sure O
to O
include O
any O
potential N
signs N
of O
deception N
. O

Again O
, O
it O
is O
generally O
a O
bad O
idea N
to O
try O
and O
determine O
how O
to O
beat O
this O
test N
. O

Don’t O
Do O
n’t O
do O
it O
, O
just O
be O
honest O
through O
the O
process N
. O

Each O
step O
is O
there O
for O
a O
reason N
. O

Finally O
, O
and O
most O
importantly O
, O
you H
should O
know O
that O
everyone O
is O
intimidated O
by O
this O
step O
in O
the O
process N
. O

You H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
need O
to O
worry O
about O
nervousness N
tripping O
the O
machine N
or O
giving O
you H
a O
false O
indication N
of O
deception N
. O

If O
it O
did O
that O
just O
because O
people N
were O
nervous O
, O
then O
no O
one N
would O
ever O
pass O
these O
tests N
. O

The O
poly O
tends O
to O
be O
the O
part N
of O
the O
process N
that O
everyone O
dreads O
… O
and O
that O
really O
shouldn't O
should O
n't O
be O
the O
case N
. O

You H
have O
already O
answered O
every O
question N
during O
your H
background N
investigation N
that O
they O
are O
going O
to O
ask O
you H
on O
the O
polygraph N
. O

Be O
honest O
and O
thorough O
during O
that O
portion N
of O
the O
process N
and O
you’ll O
you H
’ll O
be O
fine O
. O

I H
hope O
this O
has O
illuminated O
the O
polygraph N
a O
bit N
. O

It’s O
It O
’s H
one N
of O
the O
more O
intimidating O
portions N
of O
the O
process N
, O
I H
understand O
this O
. O

It O
should O
be O
the O
easiest O
part N
though O
. O

You've O
You H
've O
already O
answered O
these O
questions N
, O
some O
of O
them O
several O
times N
. O

This O
should O
just O
be O
about O
verifying O
what O
we H
already O
know O
. O

Thank O
you H
for O
taking O
the O
time N
to O
read O
this O
, O
should O
you H
have O
any O
questions N
feel O
free O
to O
PM N
me H
. O

I’m O
I H
’m O
also O
taking O
requests N
for O
the O
next O
edition N
in O
this O
series N
. O

I H
was O
leaning O
towards O
interviews N
, O
but O
that O
may O
require O
some O
separation N
as O
there O
are O
several O
formats N
you’ll O
you H
’ll O
see O
in O
this O
kind N
of O
a O
process N
. O

I've O
I H
've O
also O
seen O
questions N
about O
the O
psychological O
evals O
before O
too O
. O

How O
do O
you H
guys H
interpret O
the O
importance N
of O
racial O
issues N
seen O
in O
America O
? O

Hey O
, O
guys H
! O

As O
an O
American O
, O
we H
obviously O
learn O
about O
US O
history N
to O
a O
much O
greater O
extent N
than O
I H
imagine O
any O
of O
you H
guys H
would O
in O
school N
. O

Along O
with O
knowing O
our H
history N
, O
we H
also O
have O
grown O
up O
in O
the O
culture N
that’s O
that O
’s H
resulted O
from O
nearly O
250 O
years N
of O
our H
country’s O
country N
’s H
existence N
and O
from O
far O
more O
many O
years N
before O
our H
revolution N
. O

Naturally O
, O
we H
see O
the O
racial O
issues N
and O
tensions N
occurring O
today N
as O
a O
very O
logical O
conclusion N
, O
personal O
to O
each O
individual O
, O
and O
as O
intense O
in O
the O
realm N
of O
politics N
. O

So O
, O
my H
questions N
are O
: O

(1) O
How O
do O
different O
European O
countries N
feel O
/ O
interpret O
our H
seemingly O
, O
from O
an O
outsider’s O
outsider H
’s H
point N
of O
view N
, O
obsession N
with O
race N
? O

Do O
many O
people N
not O
understand O
why O
? O

(2) O
Do O
many O
people N
from O
your H
country N
not O
know O
anything O
about O
our H
very O
important O
domestic O
historical O
events N
/ O
movements N
( O
e.g. O
our H
kind N
of O
slavery N
, O
the O
Civil O
War N
, O
the O
Reconstruction N
Era O
, O
the O
Golden O
Age O
of O
Racism N
in O
the O
1920s N
+ O
the O
KKK O
, O
Jim O
Crow A
+ O
redlining O
, O
the O
Civil O
Rights N
Movement O
in O
the O
1960s N
, O
and O
Black O
Lives N
Matter N
+ O
criminal O
justice N
reform N
today N
, O
etc. O
) O
? O

(3) O
What O
are O
your H
guys’ O
guys H
’ O
general O
thoughts N
when O
you H
hear O
about O
our H
outrage N
over O
a O
racial O
issue N
today N
? O

US O
society N
does O
seem O
quite O
obsessed O
with O
race N
, O
and O
while O
the O
very O
concept N
of O
dividing O
people N
into O
races O
is O
repulsive O
to O
me H
, O
I H
understand O
why O
this O
is O
a O
big O
deal O
in O
the O
US O
- O
and O
I H
understand O
why O
European O
views N
on O
the O
issue N
are O
usually O
too O
simplistic O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
pretty O
sure O
that O
most O
people N
here O
only O
have O
a O
very O
vague O
idea N
of O
US O
history N
in O
this O
regard N
. O

Slavery N
is O
widely O
known O
, O
so O
is O
the O
KKK O
( O
albeit O
superficially O
) O
, O
but O
I'm O
I H
'm O
quite O
sure O
most O
people N
have O
no O
idea N
what O
Jim O
Crow A
laws N
are O
, O
or O
that O
official O
segregation N
continued O
into O
the O
1960s N
, O
and O
most O
other O
race N
- O
related O
history N
. O

It O
definitely O
looks O
to O
me H
like O
American O
society N
as O
a O
whole O
isn't O
is O
n't O
doing O
a O
good O
job N
of O
moving O
past N
these O
issues N
, O
and O
that O
the O
racial O
division N
is O
even O
encouraged O
at O
some O
level N
, O
but O
I H
am O
not O
as O
presumption N
as O
to O
preach O
solutions N
, O
having O
never O
lived O
in O
the O
US O
, O
let O
alone O
as O
a O
racial O
minority N
. O

I H
find O
it O
annoying O
when O
Americans O
try O
to O
apply O
US O
racial O
concepts N
to O
Europe O
, O
and O
thus O
make O
absurd O
statements N
, O
so O
it's O
it O
's O
only O
fair O
for O
me H
to O
admit O
my H
limited O
understanding N
of O
the O
subject O
, O
even O
if O
I H
consider O
myself H
to O
know O
US O
history N
better O
than O
90 O
% O
of O
Europeans H
. O

" O
sn't O
s O
n't O
doing O
a O
good O
job N
of O
moving O
past N
these O
issues N
" O

Is O
that O
entirely O
true O
, O
though O
? O

The O
Civil O
Rights N
movement N
ended O
50 O
years N
ago O
, O
and O
there's O
there O
's O
been O
a O
black O
president H
since O
then O
. O

There's O
There O
's O
still O
tons N
of O
problems N
, O
but O
it's O
it O
's O
massively O
improved O
. O

To O
be O
a O
minority N
in O
the O
USA O
today N
is O
a O
night N
and O
day N
difference N
to O
what O
it O
was O
during O
my H
grandparents' O
grandparents H
' O
time N
. O

It's O
It O
's O
not O
even O
close O
to O
what O
segregation N
was O
. O

(1) O
Its O
It O
s O
unreal O
. O

I H
can’t O
ca O
n’t O
really O
imagine O
being O
asked O
which O
race N
I H
am O
to O
fill O
out O
a O
college N
application N
form N
or O
something O
like O
that O
. O

Affirmative O
action N
here O
is O
very O
rare O
, O
and O
very O
often O
illegal O
. O

(2) O
More O
or O
less O
we H
know O
what O
happened O
. O

(3) O
Its O
It O
s O
understandable O
, O
since O
no O
one N
ever O
admitted O
that O
a O
lot N
of O
American O
freedom N
and O
prosperity N
comes O
from O
crimes N
against O
humanity N

Your H
last O
point N
is O
a O
little O
complicated O
. O

The O
US's O
US O
's O
wealth N
and O
power N
also O
comes O
from O
no O
actions N
of O
it's O
own O
, O
but O
it's O
geographical O
location N
in O
the O
world N
. O

We H
are O
a O
considerably O
lucky O
country N
, O
with O
only O
two O
neighbors H
that O
are O
completely O
non O
hostile O
, O
and O
two O
massive O
oceans N
on O
either O
side N
of O
us H
. O

We H
were O
always O
going O
to O
have O
advantages N
as O
a O
newly O
independent O
country N
the O
moment N
colonialist O
rule N
lost O
it's O
control N
here O
. O

It's O
It O
's O
not O
as O
simple O
as O
" O
All O
of O
USA's O
USA O
's O
achievements N
come O
from O
exploitation N
" O

Is O
this O
ring N
? O

http://vocaroo.com/i/s1tDCvWpykHC O

Is O
that O
ring N
I'm O
I H
'm O
hearing O
? O

I H
feel O
I H
sang O
quite O
well O
here O
, O
but O
then O
it's O
it O
's O
often O
hard O
to O
find O
back O
to O
this O
voice H
. O

Are O
you H
an O
opera N
singer H
? O

Why O
are O
you H
concerned O
about O
" O
ring N
" O
? O

I've O
I H
've O
been O
instructed O
to O
try O
developing O
it O
. O

I H
am O
trying O
to O
develop O
a O
generally O
pleasant O
voice H
, O
I H
have O
no O
clear N
idea N
about O
style N
. O

Ring O
is O
one N
of O
those O
things N
, O
IMO O
, O
that O
some O
dweeb H
voice H
teacher H
heard O
sitting O
in O
an O
audience N
from O
a O
real O
opera N
singer H
. O

He O
heard O
a O
" O
ring N
" O
and O
decided O
to O
make O
it O
into O
a O
technique N
. O

First O
of O
all O
the O
term N
is O
poorly O
defined O
. O

Does O
it O
mean O
twang N
? O

Singer O
formant O
? O

Which O
harmonic N
? O

Chiaroscuro N
? O

Second O
of O
all O
you're O
you H
're O
not O
an O
opera N
singer H
! O

Ring O
is O
characteristic N
of O
operatic O
voices N
. O

Have O
you H
ever O
heard O
a O
contemporary O
pop N
or O
rock N
singer H
with O
a O
" O
ring N
" O
in O
their O
voice H
? O

No O
! O

I H
would O
just O
stop N
worrying O
about O
trying O
to O
do O
shit O
which O
is O
not O
relevant O
to O
the O
style N
you're O
you H
're O
trying O
to O
learn O
. O

Focus O
on O
singing O
whatever O
it O
is O
you H
want O
to O
sing O
... O
not O
on O
singing O
opera N
! O

Alright O
. O

Do O
you H
notice O
anything O
I H
should O
work N
on O
in O
particular O
? O

Is O
it O
possible O
from O
just O
a O
recording O
? O

How O
much O
do O
you H
practice O
? O
=p O
. O

How O
many O
days N
a O
week N
and O
hour N
many O
hours N
? O

Whenever O
I H
have O
the O
apartment N
to O
myself H
. O

Usually O
twenty O
- O
thirty O
minutes N
. O

Couple N
times N
a O
week N
I H
get O
several O
sessions N
that O
are O
longer O
. O

Do O
more O
practicing O
. O

Gotta O
Got O
ta O
get O
over O
not O
wanting O
to O
practice O
when O
people N
are O
around O
=p O
. O

That's O
That O
's O
really O
the O
only O
proven O
way N
to O
get O
results N
. O

Practice O
. O

If O
you H
want O
a O
ring N
... O
I H
believe O
you H
have O
to O
use O
a O
strong O
chest N
dominant O
sound N
. O

Try O
an O
EE N
vowel N
in O
the O
comfortable O
area N
of O
your H
voice H
. O

Like O
right O
here O
. O

You H
have O
to O
do O
these O
alternate O
vowels N
right O
here O
in O
this O
ipa O
chart N
. O

so O
instead O
of O
' O
i H
' O
it'd O
it O
'd O
be O
' O
Y O
' O
( O
ee N
as O
in O
sweet O
= O
i H
) O
. O

a O
-> O
ɒ O
. O

If O
you H
try O
to O
sound N
like O
an O
opera N
singer H
, O
it'll O
it O
'll O
just O
come O
to O
you H
I H
guess O
( O
if O
you H
have O
the O
ear N
) O
. O

Won't O
Wo O
n't O
really O
happen O
if O
you H
try O
to O
sound N
like O
a O
pop N
singer H
unless O
you're O
you H
're O
like O
Josh H
Groban O
, O
which O
many O
say O
he's O
he O
's O
a O
popera O
singer H
. O

lol O

Is O
there O
a O
particular O
specific O
example N
or O
explaination N
your H
can O
give O
on O
the O
type N
of O
' O
ring N
' O
you H
are O
referring O
to O
? O

Are O
you H
referring O
to O
the O
slight O
ping N
in O
certain O
people's O
people N
's O
voices N
that O
give O
it O
a O
clarity N
or O
you H
talking O
about O
the O
slight O
' O
oomph N
' O
in O
certain O
people's O
people N
's O
voices N
? O

Either O
way N
, O
yeah O
i H
think O
it O
is O
a O
pretty O
decent O
sounding O
voice H
. O

You H
mentioned O
that O
your H
teacher H
is O
asking O
you H
to O
open O
the O
throat N
and O
i H
would O
like O
to O
know O
what O
he O
/ O
she O
said O
to O
instruct O
you H
to O
open O
the O
throat N
. O

What O
i H
am O
noticing O
is O
that O
the O
vowel N
is O
tending O
towards O
the O
' O
pushed O
' O
and O
spread O
side N
possibly O
from O
a O
slight O
over O
emphasis N
on O
the O
opening N
of O
the O
throat N
. O

Here O
is O
the O
key N
, O
you H
need O
to O
both O
have O
an O
open O
/ O
relaxed O
throat N
with O
a O
clear N
sound N
. O

A O
clear N
sound N
being O
a O
sound N
with O
clarity N
and O
focus O
or O
some O
would O
term N
to O
as O
' O
ping N
' O
. O

One O
way N
you H
can O
do O
it O
is O
pretty O
simple O
. O

Simply O
do O
2 O
sets N
of O
scales N
on O
the O

( O
the O
one N
you H
do O
on O
the O
recording O
) O

Do O
it O
twice O
. O

First O
on O
a O
hum N
/ O
ng N
sound N
and O
then O
on O
the O
second N
scale N
open O
the O
vowel N
in O
either O
an O
' O
EE N
' O
or O
an O
' O
Ah O
' O
. O

Do O
either O
the O
hum N
or O
the O
' O
ng N
' O
. O

Whichever O
is O
more O
comfortable O
for O
you H
. O

The O
' O
ng N
' O
is O
basically O
a O
sustained O
' O
ng N
' O
pronunciation N
as O
in O
the O
word N
' O
sing O
' O
or O
' O
ring N
' O
. O

Some O
also O
would O
call O
this O
an O
open O
hum N
. O

Then O
on O
the O
hum N
/ O
ng N
, O
try O
to O
find O
a O
clear N
buzzing O
sensation N
in O
the O
front N
of O
your H
face N
and O
at O
the O
lips N
if O
you H
are O
doing O
a O
hum N
. O

Do O
not O
force N
the O
sensation N
, O
focus O
on O
simply O
humming O
and O
the O
sensation N
should O
materialize O
by O
itself O
. O

Then O
simply O
try O
to O
keep O
this O
same O
clarity N
or O
' O
buzz N
' O
when O
you H
open O
the O
mouth N
into O
the O
EE N
/ O
AH O
vowel N
. O

You H
may O
need O
to O
record N
yourself H
while O
doing O
this O
. O

Many O
a O
times N
i H
have O
notice O
that O
people N
can O
produce O
a O
relatively O
focused O
and O
clean O
hum N
/ O
ng N
. O

But O
when O
they O
open O
the O
mouth N
to O
produce O
a O
vowel N
, O
the O
tone N
quality N
drastically O
changes N
into O
something O
way N
less O
focused O
and O
clear N
. O

So O
when O
you H
record N
yourself H
, O
see O
if O
you H
can O
produce O
the O
cleanest O
most O
' O
forward O
' O
sound N
on O
the O
hum N
/ O
ng N
and O
see O
that O
if O
you H
open O
to O
the O
vowel N
, O
does O
the O
tone N
quality N
drastically O
change O
. O

The O
goal N
is O
to O
keep O
the O
tone N
quality N
relatively O
consistent O
. O

Remember O
that O
you H
are O
trying O
to O
keep O
the O
same O
clarity N
and O
focus O
, O
different O
people N
sound N
different O
when O
the O
open O
the O
hum N
depending O
on O
the O
physiology N
of O
the O
vocal O
tract N
and O
cords N
. O

So O
it O
is O
more O
important O
to O
focus O
on O
the O
forward O
clarity N
so O
as O
to O
not O
make O
the O
sound N
overly O
nasal O
or O
squeezed O
. O

Hope O
this O
helped O

TL;DR O
: O
I'm O
I H
'm O
36 O
, O
married O
, O
and O
introvert H
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
going O
into O
my H
second N
year N
of O
a O
PhD N
program N
, O
and O
I've O
I H
've O
found O
myself H
being O
subjected O
to O
numerous O
social O
things N
that O
I H
feel O
obligated O
to O
contend O
with O
, O
primarily O
due O
to O
social O
pressure O
- O
club N
meetings N
, O
happy O
hours N
, O
BBQs N
, O
etc. O

Long O
story N
short O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
older O
, O
and O
would O
rather O
spend O
my H
time N
at O
home N
with O
a O
video N
game N
than O
basically O
any O
of O
the O
people N
in O
my H
department N
, O
save O
very O
few O
( O
who O
I H
have O
no O
problem N
hanging O
out O
with O
outside O
of O
the O
academic O
setting N
) O
. O

Does O
anyone O
else O
deal O
with O
this O
? O

Does O
the O
guilt N
get O
to O
you H
? O

I'm O
I H
'm O
23 O
, O
single O
, O
and O
an O
introvert H
. O

I H
try O
to O
show O
up O
every O
once O
in O
a O
while O
to O
remind O
people N
that O
I H
exist O
but O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
go O
to O
most O
parties N
and O
happy O
hours N
. O

You H
have O
the O
great O
excuse O
of O
a O
family H
to O
go O
home N
to O
. O

Use O
it O
! O

I H
think O
it's O
it O
's O
important O
to O
attend O
some O
of O
these O
engagements N
. O

You H
never O
know O
who O
you H
might O
meet O
or O
what O
you H
may O
miss O
. O

I H
too O
am O
an O
older O
grad H
student H
and O
am O
engaged O
. O

Socially O
, O
I H
have O
no O
reason N
to O
attend O
these O
events N
. O

I H
remind O
my H
fiancé O
that O
it O
is O
imperative O
to O
attend O
at O
least O
a O
few O
a O
year N
for O
those O
purpose N
of O
networking O
and O
reminding O
people N
I H
exist O
. O

Remember O
, O
at O
present N
your H
cohort N
are O
your H
fellow H
students H
... O
in O
the O
future N
they O
could O
be O
your H
coworkers O
or O
colleagues H
in O
a O
professional O
setting N
. O

Totally O
agree O
( O
though O
I'm O
I H
'm O
very O
social O
and O
also O
organize O
a O
lot N
of O
these O
kinds N
of O
events N
) O
. O

People N
who O
don't O
do O
n't O
attend O
departmental O
events N
at O
all O
or O
put O
in O
face N
time N
can O
miss O
out O
on O
a O
lot N
of O
opportunities N
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
in O
a O
position N
where O
I H
am O
often O
asked O
to O
recommend O
fellow H
students H
for O
awards N
, O
grant N
opportunities N
, O
jobs N
, O
and O
publishing O
opportunities N
. O

If O
I H
only O
see O
you H
once O
a O
year N
and O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
or O
trust N
you H
, O
I H
won't O
wo O
n't O
be O
recommending O
you H
for O
anything O
. O

I H
imagine O
it's O
it O
's O
the O
same O
for O
faculty N
. O

If O
people N
don't O
do O
n't O
see O
you H
often O
enough O
to O
build O
a O
relationship N
, O
they O
aren't O
are O
n't O
going O
to O
go O
out O
of O
their O
way N
to O
help O
you H
succeed O
. O

I H
agree O
with O
this O
. O

And O
making O
appearances N
at O
things N
like O
department N
BBQs N
and O
club N
meetings N
will O
probably O
earn O
you H
points O
with O
your H
adviser H
/ O
other O
faculty N
. O

You H
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
be O
friends H
with O
everyone O
but O
you H
should O
probably O
make O
an O
effort N
to O
get O
to O
know O
people N
and O
make O
connections N
. O

edit O
: O
Just O
to O
build O
on O
this O
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
feel O
guilty O
about O
not O
going O
to O
something O
. O

If O
it's O
it O
's O
not O
important O
to O
you H
, O
it's O
it O
's O
not O
important O
to O
you H
. O

Just O
don't O
do O
n't O
feel O
obligated O
to O
every O
single O
meeting N
, O
BBQ O
, O
and O
happy O
hour N
. O

I H
think O
it’s O
it O
’s H
important O
to O
go O
to O
SOME O
events N
in O
the O
name N
of O
collegiality O
, O
but O
you H
are O
under O
no O
obligation N
to O
go O
to O
all O
of O
them O
or O
feel O
guilty O
for O
declining O
things N
like O
happy O
hours N
. O

Grad H
school N
can O
be O
a O
very O
isolating O
experience N
, O
so O
after O
work N
events N
are O
good O
for O
people N
without O
local O
support N
networks N
( O
a O
girl H
in O
my H
program N
told O
me H
last O
week N
that O
she O
didn’t O
did O
n’t O
talk O
to O
a O
single O
person H
over O
that O
weekend N
) O
but O
are O
not O
required O
. O

I H
make O
sure O
to O
put O
in O
an O
appearance N
at O
the O
major O
events N
( O
back O
to O
school N
reception N
, O
holiday N
party N
, O
end N
of O
year N
reception N
) O
but O
don’t O
do O
n’t O
let O
people N
guilt N
me H
into O
other O
things N
. O

“ O
Thanks N
for O
inviting O
me H
, O
but O
I H
have O
other O
plans N
” O
is O
all O
you H
need O
. O

Then O
don’t O
do O
n’t O
go O
. O

There’s O
There O
’s H
no O
shame N
in O
not O
participating O
. O

No O
, O
but O
there O
are O
downsides N
, O
like O
not O
building N
a O
network N
. O

Unless O
you H
are O
in O
a O
department N
full O
of O
extroverts H
that O
shame N
you H
for O
this O

Plus O
networking O
is O
a O
thing N
. O

Getting O
in O
appearances N
with O
professors H
that O
might O
hold O
job N
opportunities N
is O
vital O
depending O
on O
your H
field N
. O

Though O
balance O
is O
key N
. O

You H
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
go O
to O
all O
of O
the O
socials N
. O

Some O
of O
them O
are O
for O
us H
lonely O
, O
single O
extroverts H
that O
need O
a O
social O
life N
. O

Focus O
on O
club N
meetings N
that O
will O
look O
good O
on O
your H
CV O
and O
happy O
hours N
that O
have O
important O
professionals H
attending O
. O

Yeah O
why O
do O
I H
fave O
the O
feeling O
mist N
profs H
can’t O
ca O
n’t O
help O
u H
get O
a O
job N
through O
their O
connections N

I H
say O
this O
as O
a O
pretty O
social O
member N
of O
a O
pretty O
social O
dept O
- O
don't O
do O
n't O
burn O
bridges N
, O
but O
don't O
do O
n't O
go O
if O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
! O

I H
think O
a O
lot N
of O
social O
events N
help O
new O
students H
find O
their O
friends H
, O
and O
help O
maintain O
a O
wide O
network N
of O
camaraderie N
and O
support N
. O

If O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
feel O
like O
you H
need O
those O
, O
then O
stay O
friendly O
with O
people N
but O
don't O
do O
n't O
feel O
the O
need O
to O
attend O
. O

Maybe O
go O
to O
the O
particularly O
big O
events N
and O
a O
thing N
or O
two O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
semester N
to O
meet O
the O
new O
students H
( O
considering O
that O
your H
existing O
friends H
may O
graduate H
before O
you H
! O
) O
and O
call O
that O
good O
. O

Well O
at O
least O
you're O
you H
're O
married O
and O
have O
someone H
who O
gets O
you H
to O
hang O
out O
with O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
30 O
, O
also O
going O
into O
my H
second N
yr N
and O
I've O
I H
've O
already O
passed O
on O
several O
invites N
. O

I H
just O
straight O
up O
tell O
them O
I'm O
I H
'm O
going O
home N
if O
asked O
or O
ignore O
the O
invite O
completely O
. O

I H
feel O
like O
everybody O
got O
to O
know O
me H
last O
year N
and O
I'm O
I H
'm O
a O
pleasant O
enough O
coworker O
to O
be O
around O
but O
there O
was O
no O
real O
connection N
there O
and O
tbh O
I H
think O
everyone O
is O
okay O
with O
it O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
particularly O
special O
so O
I H
doubt O
I'm O
I H
'm O
missed O
that O
much O
lol O
, O
so O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
feel O
quilty O
. O

The O
big O
events N
I H
might O
go O
to O
like O
end N
of O
summer N
BBQ O
, O
but O
like O
coffee N
and O
lunch N
and O
happy O
hour N
( O
I H
hate O
beer N
) O
I H
MIA O
and O
everyone O
seems O
cool O
with O
it O
. O

Weird O
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
remember O
writing N
this O
post N
... O

I'm O
I H
'm O
the O
same O
way N
! O

You H
aren't O
are O
n't O
under O
any O
obligation N
to O
attend O
social O
events N
, O
but O
don't O
do O
n't O
completely O
write O
them O
off O
either O
. O

No O
one N
goes O
to O
every O
event N
but O
find O
a O
timeline N
that O
fits O
with O
your H
other O
obligations N
and O
see O
if O
you H
can O
make O
it O
to O
one N
a O
month N
or O
something O
like O
that O
. O

I H
went O
into O
my H
program N
thinking O
of O
the O
degree N
as O
the O
end N
goal N
, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
lot N
more O
to O
gain O
from O
graduate H
school N
than O
more O
letters N
after O
your H
name N
. O

Socializing O
can O
help O
you H
get O
more O
out O
of O
your H
program N
, O
have O
friends H
to O
talk O
about O
your H
research N
with O
who O
actually O
care N
and O
will O
be O
interested O
in O
talking O
out O
complex O
points O
you're O
you H
're O
stuck O
on O
. O

These O
are O
also O
people N
who O
can O
let O
you H
know O
about O
fellowships N
, O
conferences N
etc. O
that O
will O
enhance O
your H
experience N
. O

Overall O
you H
have O
to O
find O
a O
balance O
that O
works O
for O
you H
but O
a O
PhD N
comes O
with O
a O
huge O
opportunity N
cost O
to O
the O
rest N
of O
your H
life N
regardless O
, O
so O
it O
might O
be O
worth N
it O
to O
look O
at O
these O
events N
and O
your H
peers H
as O
part N
of O
what O
you're O
you H
're O
getting O
out O
of O
your H
program N
. O

We H
know O
shit O
- O
all O
about O
space N

I H
think O
any O
discussion N
about O
space N
or O
aliens H
is O
pointless O
until O
people N
start O
discussing O
nasa's O
nasa O
's O
fakery N
but O
it O
appears O
a O
lot N
of O
people N
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
into O
it O
. O

Logically O
, O
in O
a O
incredibly O
vast O
universe N
, O
it O
makes O
sense N
that O
humans A
aren't O
are O
n't O
the O
only O
sentient O
beings A
out O
there O
. O

The O
problem N
with O
this O
is O
that O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
that's O
that O
's O
what O
we're O
we H
're O
working O
with O
anymore O
, O
the O
entire O
conception N
of O
distant O
suns N
, O
planets N
, O
black O
-holes N
, O
alien H
life N
. O

It's O
It O
's O
all O
suspect O
because O
we H
get O
all O
our H
news N
and O
information N
from O
a O
small O
group N
of O
people N
and O
these O
people N
are O
liars H
. O

I H
watched O
' O
The O
Martian A
' O
a O
few O
days N
ago O
, O
how O
much O
of O
it O
actually O
corresponds O
to O
the O
realities N
of O
space N
and O
space N
travel O
? O

When O
we H
see O
an O
astronaut H
in O
the O
iss O
, O
is O
there O
really O
someone H
in O
a O
craft N
up O
there O
or O
is O
it O
all O
created O
in O
a O
studio N
somewhere O
? O

One O
thing N
we H
do O
know O
is O
that O
they O
can O
simulate O
the O
appearance N
of O
weightlessness N
since O
at O
least O
1995 O
. O

Just O
watch O
the O
apollo O
13 O
movie N
. O

Anyone O
who O
bothers O
to O
actually O
look O
into's O
into O
's O
the O
details N
of O
nasa's O
nasa O
's O
claims N
will O
realize O
they O
never O
went O
to O
the O
moon N
, O
let O
alone O
6 O
times N
. O

During O
Apollo O
there's O
there O
's O
a O
video N
of O
astronauts H
supposedly O
in O
space N
taking O
a O
video N
of O
the O
earth N
, O
yet O
the O
video N
( O
that O
goes O
on O
recording O
after O
they O
think O
its O
it O
s O
over O
) O
reveals O
that O
they O
used O
cardboard O
to O
block O
the O
windows N
to O
create O
the O
illusion N
that O
they O
were O
far O
away O
and O
were O
probably O
only O
in O
low O
earth N
orbit N
. O

The O
actual O
structure N
of O
the O
iss O
itself O
looks O
different O
in O
different O
nasa O
pictures N
, O
how O
is O
this O
possible O
? O

There's O
There O
's O
abundant O
evidence N
that O
they O
faked O
the O
challenger O
disaster N

Why O
? O

There O
are O
videos N
where O
women H
astronauts H
have O
weird O
puffy O
hair N
( O
which O
shouldn't O
should O
n't O
happen O
) O
in O
the O
iss O
when O
their O
hair N

does O
n't O
act N
in O
such O
a O
way N
on O

There O
are O
videos N
of O
astronauts H
supposedly O
in O
space N
when O
suddenly O
a O
bubble N
leaves N
their O
helmet N

The O
amount N
of O
fakery N
is O
overwhelming O
, O
how O
does O
nasa O
even O
have O
a O

Does O

? O

tldr O
: O

We H
get O
all O
our H
information N
about O
space N
from O
space N
agencies N
and O
hollywood O
( O
they've O
they O
've O
always O
worked O
together O
) O

Space N
agencies N
lie O
all O
the O
time N

about O
everything O

How O
can O
we H
claim O
to O
know O
anything O
if O
# O
2 O
is O
true O
? O

Conclusion N
= O
we H
know O
shit O
- O
all O
about O
space N

We'll O
We H
'll O
never O
get O
anywhere O
as O
a O
species A
as O

as O
humanity N

even O

Talk O
about O

With O

May O
as O
well O
be O
a O
Space N

considering O
how O
much O
of O
the O
stuff N
any O
of O
us H
have O
actually O
experienced O
outside O
of O
movies N
/ O
media N
... O
which O
is O
ZERO O

No O
, O
really O
, O
if O
anyone O
here O
has O
an O
actual O
story N
of O
experiencing O
Space N
, O
I'd O
I H
'd O
love O
to O
hear O
it O

Pretty O
sure O
we H
all O
get O
to O
say O
it's O
it O
's O
second N

at O

I H

He O

I H

I H
pointed O

so O
much O
of O
the O

this O

purposely O
confuggulated O
to O
us H

how O
can O
one N

One O
of O
the O

because O
you H

TIFU O
by O
throwing O
my H
steak N
out O
a O
window N

Last O
night N
, O
my H
wife's O
wife H
's H
boss A
from O
her O
brand N
new O
job N
invited O
us H
over O
for O
dinner N
. O

On O
the O
drive O
over O
, O
my H
wife H
reiterated O
many O
times N
to O
me H
just O
how O
important O
it O
was O
to O
make O
a O
good O
impression N
. O

I H
scoffed O
and O
arrogantly O
informed O
my H
silly O
wife H
that O
I H
always O
make O
good O
impressions N
. O

My H
wife's O
wife H
's H
boss A
is O
a O
single O
lady H
in O
her O
fifties N
, O
so O
it O
was O
just O
the O
three O
of O
us H
. O

We H
chitchatted O
over O
drinks N
and O
salads N
and O
seemed O
to O
really O
be O
hitting O
it O
off O
. O

She O
laughed O
at O
my H
well O
- O
timed O
, O
perfectly O
- O
appropriate O
jokes N
and O
my H
wife H
seemed O
pleased O
. O

Soon O
she O
brought O
out O
the O
main O
course N
, O
a O
nice O
big O
juicy O
steak N
for O
each O
of O
us H
. O

As O
I H
began O
to O
cut O
into O
my H
steak N
, O
I H
was O
discouraged O
to O
discover O
how O
under O
cooked O
this O
steak N
was O
. O

Now O
, O
I've O
I H
've O
had O
my H
fair O
share O
of O
rare O
steak N
. O

I H
prefer O
medium N
, O
but O
I H
can O
handle N
rare O
. O

This O
was O
several O
- O
minutes N
- O
on O
- O
a O
- O
hot O
- O
grill N
short O
of O
rare O
. O

I H
probably O
could've O
could O
've O
resuscitated O
the O
cow A
had O
I H
tried O
. O

Instead O
, O
I H
sat O
there O
fidgeting O
with O
my H
knife N
and O
fork N
, O
worrying O
about O
how O
I H
was O
going O
to O
get O
away O
with O
not O
eating O
this O
steak N
. O

Claim O
vegan-ism O
? O

No O
, O
I'd O
I H
'd O
already O
feigned O
great O
enthusiasm N
upon O
seeing O
the O
steak N
. O

Just O
then O
, O
our H
hostess H
excused O
herself O
to O
the O
kitchen N
to O
take O
care N
of O
some O
dessert N
preparations N
. O

As O
I H
looked O
across O
the O
fancy O
dining N
room N
table N
at O
the O
open O
window N
of O
this O
3rd O
story N
apartment N
... O
a O
cartoon N
light N
bulb N
appeared O
over O
my H
head N
. O

I H
knew O
I H
had O
to O
be O
decisive O
, O
realizing O
that O
she O
could O
return O
at O
any O
moment N
. O

I H
committed O
. O

I H
grabbed O
the O
steak N
with O
my H
hand N
, O
gently O
shook O
off O
the O
juice N
and O
executed O
a O
perfect O
throw O
right O
through O
the O
center N
of O
the O
open O
window N
. O

Here's O
Here O
's H
the O
big O
time N
FU O
. O

The O
window N
wasn't O
was O
n't O
open O
. O

It O
was O
the O
cleanest O
fricking O
window N
you've O
you H
've O
ever O
seen O
in O
your H
life N
. O

That O
is O
, O
until O
my H
mostly O
raw O
slab N
of O
steak N
slammed O
up O
against O
it O
and O
slowly O
slid O
down O
leaving O
a O
trail N
of O
bloody O
juice N
in O
its O
wake O
. O

My H
wife H
- O
who's O
steak N
was O
a O
nice O
medium N
rare O
and O
was O
unaware O
of O
my H
predicament N
- O
turned O
, O
jaw N
dropped O
, O
and O
stared O
at O
me H
like O
I H
was O
an O
alien H
from O
another O
planet N
. O

This O
look O
then O
slowly O
morphed O
into O
more O
of O
a O
there O
- O
is O
- O
no O
- O
place N
- O
on O
- O
this O
- O
planet N
- O
you H
- O
can O
- O
ever O
- O
hide N
- O
from O
- O
me H
expression N
of O
demonic O
anger N
. O

My H
wife's O
wife H
's H
boss A
heard O
the O
thud N
of O
the O
steak N
- O
on O
- O
window N
impact N
and O
came O
quickly O
. O

She O
took O
in O
the O
scene N
, O
the O
steak N
sitting O
on O
the O
window N
sill N
, O
the O
blood N
trail N
, O
my H
empty O
plate N
, O
and O
then O
gave O
me H
an O
inquisitive O
, O
puzzled O
look O
. O

I H
just O
didn't O
did O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
say O
. O

It O
felt N
like O
a O
minute O
of O
silence N
, O
but O
was O
probably O
3 O
or O
4 O
seconds N
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
best O
I H
could O
manage O
was O
" O
I H
... O
I'm O
I H
'm O
so O
sorry O
. O

I H
am O
such O
a O
clutz O
... O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
... O

I H
was O
just O
cutting N
it O
.. O

and O
... O
it O
... O
... O
it O
slipped O
... O
just O
ask O
my H
wife H
, O
I H
really O
am O
a O
clutz O
... O
right O
honey N
? O

... O
( O
no O
help O
coming O
from O
that O
direction N
) O
... O

I H
will O
clean O
this O
up O
... O

I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
believe O
this O
... O

I H
am O
so O
sorry O
" O
etc O
... O
etc O
... O

Both O
women H
continued O
to O
stare O
at O
me H
like O
I H
had O
escaped O
from O
the O
loony O
bin O
, O
as O
I H
smeared O
the O
blood N
around O
the O
window N
with O
my H
cloth N
napkin N
, O
dusted O
off O
the O
steak N
, O
and O
continued O
to O
mutter O
my H
incoherent O
explanation N
. O

I H
knew O
no O
one N
was O
buying O
the O
story N
. O

I H
knew O
what O
I H
had O
to O
do O
. O

I H
sheepishly O
returned O
to O
my H
seat N
and O
proceeded O
to O
eat O
every O
bite N
of O
that O
disgusting O
, O
cold O
, O
chewy O
, O
bloody O
, O
raw O
steak N
. O

I H
remained O
pretty O
quiet N
the O
rest N
of O
the O
evening N
. O

My H
wife's O
wife H
's H
only O
two O
words N
to O
me H
since O
the O
incident N
are O
" O
I'm O
I H
'm O
fine O
" O

Stroke N
Survivors H

how O
" O
aware O
" O
were O
you H
just O
after O
you H

and O
were O

to O

? O

My H
35 O
year N
old O
cousin H
just O
had O
a O
stroke N
and O
is O
still O
in O
recovery N
. O

How O
much O
did O
you H
perceive O
your H
surroundings N
( O
hospital N
) O
and O
how O
was O
your H
internal O
monologue N
? O

I'm O
I H
'm O
about O
to O
go O
visit O
and O
would O
like O
to O
know O
the O
best O
way N
to O
communicate O
with O
her O
if O
it's O
it O
's H
helpful O
. O

I H
know O
each O
case N
is O
different O
, O
but O
wanted O
to O
know O
what O
the O
range N
of O
experiences N
are O
. O

I H
internally O
' O
knew O
' O
what O
was O
going O
on O
( O
after O
the O
initial O
hours N
of O
just O
being O
a O
complete O
mess N
) O
, O
but O
the O
internal O
monologue N
was O
very O
simplistic O
-- O
it O
was O
an O
understanding N
and O
acknowledgment N
of O
my H
surroundings N
and O
what O
was O
going O
on O
, O
but O
also O
a O
realization N
that O
my H
consciousness N
was O
traumatically O
altered O
. O

It O
was O
a O
mess N
of O
thoughts N
, O
but O
the O
acute O
period N
was O
mostly O
just O
sleeping O
and O
just O
acknowledging O
major O
changes N
( O
" O
Oh O
, O
I H
guess O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
walk O
anymore O
, O
" O
and O
" O
Oh O
, O
I H
guess O
I'll O
I H
'll O
have O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
write O
left O
- O

now O
" O
) O
but O
there O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
much O
going O
on O
. O

Best O
, O
/MurrayStreet O

I H
could O
always O
speak O
to O
some O
degree N
, O
sometimes O
it O
was O
jibberish O
but O
I H
could O
speak O
... O
so O
not O
sure O
how O
useful O
my H
experience N
is O
for O
you H
. O

I H
had O
my H
stroke N
at O
31 O
, O
so O
pretty O
close O
age N
wise O
. O

Compared O
to O
many O
here O
my H
stroke N
was O
not O
so O
severe O
, O
I H
recovered O
fully O
& O
quickly O
. O

I H
felt N
like O
I H
was O
present N
, O
but O
in O
hindsight N
I H
wasn't O
was O
n't O
nearly O
as O
with O
it O
as O
I H
felt N
internally O
at O
the O
time N
. O

I H
thought O
I H
was O
participating O
in O
conversation N
with O
my H
family H
, O
but O
my H
husband H
tells O
me H
I H
just O
kind N
of O
laid O
there O
and O
laughed O
or O
nodded O
my H
head N
... O
did O
not O
contribute O
and O
when O
I H
tried O
it O
didn't O
did O
n't O
make O
sense N
. O

I H
felt N
like O
I H
was O
speaking O
normally O
and O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
understand O
why O
people N
would O
look O
at O
me H
funny O
or O
not O
understand O
, O
at O
least O
until O
I H
was O
prompted O
to O
say O
certain O
words N
and O
was O
unable O
to O
say O
them O
at O
all O
... O
then O
I H
somewhat O
accepted O
it O
. O

I H
remember O
bits N
and O
pieces N
of O
the O
conversation N
, O
my H
brother H
talking O
to O
the O
nurse O
about O
some O
tool N
they O
used O
to O
keep O
an O
eye N
on O
ICP O
, O
etc. O

I H
knew O
where O
I H
was O
, O
but O
I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
feel O
like O
I H
should O
be O
there O
. O

I H
always O
knew O
my H
husband H
was O
there O
and O
only O
left O
when O
other O
family H
stayed O
with O
me H
. O

I H
really O
appreciated O
that O
. O

I H
just O
got O
back O
from O
visiting O
and O
it O
seems O
like O
my H
cousin's O
cousin H
's H
experience N
has O
a O
lot N
in O
common O
with O
yours H
. O

In O
less O
than O
a O
week N
, O
she O
can O
walk O
on O
her O
own O
, O
and O
apparently O
can O
play O
Wii O
. O

She O
seems O
to O
recognize O
most O
people N
, O
although O
she O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
identify O
herself O
in O
a O
picture N
. O
:-( O

Her O
vocabulary N
is O
limited O
but O
we H
are O
able O
to O
communicate O
. O

A O
lot N
of O
my H
family H
have O
young O
children H
so O
they O
brought O
in O
children's O
children H
's H
books N
and O
are O
reading O
them O
to O
her O
. O

Is O
that O
a O
good O
start O
, O
or O
should O
we H
just O
grab O
a O
Jane O
Austen O
and O
read O
that O
to O
her O
? O

We'll O
We H
'll O
definitely O
be O
taking O
our H
cues N
from O
the O
speech N
therapists H
for O
re-teaching O
her O
language N
but O
to O
entertain O
and O
stimulate O
should O
we H
raise O
the O
reading O
level N
? O

The O
speech N
therapists H
and O
her O
doctor(s) H
would O
probably O
have O
the O
best O
ideas N
based O
on O
her O
progress N
but O
if O
it O
seems O
like O
she O
follows O
the O
children's O
children H
's H
books N
I H
would O
just O
bump N
it O
up O
gradually O
by O
trying O
middle O
readers H
and O
young O
adult O
. O

I H
was O
able O
to O
understand O
people N
the O
entire O
time N
, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
way N
I H
could O
really O
keep O
up O
with O
a O
novel N
on O
the O
level N
of O
Jane H
Austen H
. O

I H
watched O
movies N
more O
than O
I H
read O
/ O
was O
read O
to O
, O
and O
pretty O
simple O
movies N
at O
that O
so O
it O
didn't O
did O
n't O
really O
matter N

The O
two O

I H

another O

The O

the O

2015 O
was O
without O
a O
doubt O
the O
original O
cut O

The O
3 O

I H
guess O

be O
a O
part N

the O
production N

Snyder H
made O
the O

He O
did O
his O
job N

he O
had O
no O
oversight N

but O
even O
he O
was O
aware O
that O
a O
3 O

isnt O
is O
nt O
necessarily O
what O
the O

wants O
. O

The O
studio N
should O
ve O
just O
released O
the O

It O
probably O
would've O
would O
've O
made O
less O
with O
the O
decrease O

number N

but O
it O
would've O
would O
've O
been O
a O
more O
respected O
film N

and O
that O
carries O
more O
wait N
in O
the O
end N
. O

But O
the O

was O
uneven O
in O
its O
delivery N
of O
action N

It O
was O
mostly O
contained O

the O
last O
act N

Having O
a O
2 O
hour N

the O

probably O

much O
quicker O

even O
though O
they O
wouldnt' O

have O

that O

there O

multiple O

the O

But O
all O
we H

in O

the O

then O
the O

. O

Drop O
areas N
are O
displayed O
differently O
depending O
on O
the O

For O
example N
, O
a O
series N
drop O

About O
avoiding O

two O
ANSI O

ANSI-92 O
, O
are O
not O

. O

When O
you H
create O
a O
Microsoft O
Access N
database N
, O
you H
need O
to O
decide O
which O
query N
mode N
you H
are O
going O
to O
use O
, O
because O
mixing O
queries N
created O
in O
both O
query N
modes N
could O
produce O
runtime O

unexpected O
results N
. O

The O
range N

types N
, O
reserved O
words N
, O
and O
wildcard O
characters A
are O
different O
in O
each O

Example N
of O
a O
query N
using O
wildcard O
characters A

A O
query N
that O
uses O
wildcard O
characters A
in O
a O
criteria N

can O
produce O
different O

An O
ANSI-89 O

" O
, O
not O
all O

because O
the O
percent N

) O
is O
not O
a O
wildcard O

in O
ANSI-89 O
SQL O
. O

Example N
of O
a O
query N

a O
duplicate O

If O
a O

an O

column N
name N
and O
you H
create O
a O
calculated O

using O
the O

the O

As O

Who O
he O

, O
where O
he O
came O
from O
, O
and O
what O
he O
did O
are O
of O
no O
great O
importance N

We H
know O
, O
for O
example N
, O
that O
he O
was O
thirty-five O
years N
old O
. O

We H
know O
that O
he O
had O
once O
been O
married O
, O
had O
once O
been O
a O
father H
, O
and O
that O
both O
his O
wife H

were O
now O
dead O
. O

We H
also O
know O
that O
he O
wrote O
books N
. O

To O
be O
precise O
, O
we H
know O
that O
he O
wrote O
mystery N
novels N
. O

These O
works O
were O
written O
under O
the O
name N
of O
William H
Wilson H
, O
and O
he O
produced O
them O
at O
the O
rate N
of O
about O
one N
a O
year N
, O
which O
brought O
in O
enough O
money N
for O
him O
to O
live O
modestly O
in O
a O
small O
New O
York O
apartment N
. O

Because O
he O
spent O
no O
more O
than O
five O
or O
six O
months N
on O
a O
novel N
, O
for O
the O
rest N
of O
the O
year N
he O
was O
free O
to O
do O
as O
he O
wished O
. O

He O
read O
many O
books N
, O
he O
looked O
at O
paintings N
, O
he O
went O
to O
the O
movies N
. O

In O
the O
summer N
he O
watched O
baseball N
on O
television N
; O
in O
the O
winter N
he O
went O
to O
the O
opera N
. O

More O
than O
anything O
, O
however O
, O
what O
he O
liked O
to O
do O
was O
walk O
. O

Nearly O
every O
day N
, O
rain N
or O
shine N
, O
hot O
or O
cold O
, O
he O
would O
leave O
his O
apartment N
to O
walk O
through O
the O
city N
– O
never O
really O
going O
anywhere O
, O
but O
simply O
going O
wherever O
his O
legs N
happened O
to O
take O
him O
. O

New O
York O
was O
an O
inexhaustible O
space N
, O
a O
labyrinth N
of O
endless O
steps N
, O
and O
no O
matter N
how O
far O
he O
walked O
, O
no O
matter N
how O
well O
he O
came O
to O
know O
its O
neighborhoods N
and O
streets N
, O
it O
always O
left O
him O
with O
the O
feeling O
of O
being O
lost O
. O

Lost O
, O
not O
only O
in O
the O
city N
, O
but O
within O
himself O
as O
well O
. O

Each O
time N
he O
took O
a O
walk O
, O
he O
felt N
as O
though O
he O
were O
leaving O
himself O
behind O
, O
and O
by O
giving O
himself O
up O
to O
the O
movement N
of O
the O
streets N
, O
by O
reducing O
himself O
to O
a O
seeing O
eye N
, O
he O
was O
able O
to O
escape O
the O
obligation N
to O
think O
, O
and O
this O
, O
more O
than O
anything O
else O
, O
brought O
him O
a O
measure N
of O
peace N
, O
a O
salutatory O
emptiness N
within O
. O

The O
world N
was O
outside O
of O
him O
, O
around O
him O
, O
before O
him O
, O
and O
the O
speed N
with O
which O
it O
kept O
changing O
made O
it O
impossible O
for O
him O
to O
dwell O
on O
any O
one N
thing N
for O
very O
long O
. O

Motion O
was O
of O
the O
essence N
, O
the O
act N
of O
putting O
one N
foot N
in O
front N
of O
the O
other O
and O
allowing O
himself O
to O
follow O
the O
drift O
of O
his O
own O
body N
. O

By O
wandering O
aimlessly O
, O
all O
places N
became O
equal O
, O
and O
it O
no O
longer O
mattered O
where O
he O
was O
. O

On O
his O
best O
walks O
, O
he O
was O
able O
to O
feel O
that O
he O
was O
nowhere O
. O

New O
York O
was O
the O
nowhere O
he O
had O
built O
around O
himself O
, O
and O
he O
realized O
that O
he O
had O
no O
intention N
of O
ever O
leaving O
it O
again O
. O

In O
the O
past N
, O
Quinn H
had O
been O
more O
ambitious O
. O

As O
a O
young O
man H
, O
he O
had O
published O
several O
books N
of O
poetry N
, O
had O
written O
plays N
, O
critical O
essays N
, O
and O
had O
worked O
on O
a O
number N
of O
long O
translations N
. O

But O
quite O
abruptly O
, O
he O
had O
given O
up O
all O
that O
. O

A O
part N
of O
him O
had O
died O
, O
he O
told O
his O
friends H
, O
and O
he O
did O
not O
want O
it O
coming O
back O
to O
haunt O
him O
. O

It O
was O
then O
that O
he O
had O
taken O
on O
the O
name N
of O
William H
Wilson H
. O

Quinn H
was O
no O
longer O
that O
part N
of O
him O
that O
could O
write O
books N
, O
and O
although O
in O
many O
ways N
Quinn H
continued O
to O
exist O
, O
he O
no O
longer O
existed O
for O
anyone O
but O
himself O
. O

The O
next O
morning N
, O
Quinn H
woke O
up O
earlier O
than O
he O
had O
in O
several O
weeks N
. O

As O
he O
drank O
his O
coffee N
, O
buttered O
his O
toast O
, O
and O
read O
through O
the O
baseball N
scores N
in O
the O
paper N
( O
the O
Mets O
had O
lost O
again O
, O
two O
to O
one N
, O
on O
a O
ninth N
inning N
error N
) O
, O
it O
did O
not O
occur O
to O
him O
that O
he O
was O
going O
to O
show O
up O
for O
his O
appointment N
. O

Even O
that O
locution N
, O
' O
his O
appointment N
' O
, O
seemed O
odd O
to O
him O
. O

It O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
his O
appointment N
, O
it O
was O
Paul H
Auster's O
Auster O
's H
. O

And O
who O
that O
person H
was O
he O
had O
no O
idea N
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
as O
time N
wore O
on O
he O
found O
himself O
doing O
a O
good O
imitation N
of O
a O
man H
preparing O
to O
go O
out O
. O

He O
cleared O
the O
table N
of O
the O
breakfast N
dishes N
, O
tossed O
the O
newspaper N
on O
the O
couch N
, O
went O
into O
the O
bathroom N
, O
showered O
, O
shaved O
, O
went O
on O
to O
the O
bedroom N
wrapped O
in O
two O
towels N
, O
opened O
the O
closet N
and O
picked O
out O
his O
clothes N
for O
the O
day N
. O

He O
found O
himself O
tending O
toward O
a O
jacket N
and O
a O
tie N
. O

Quinn H
had O
not O
worn O
a O
tie N
since O
the O
funerals N
of O
his O
wife H
and O
son H
, O
and O
he O
could O
not O
even O
remember O
if O
he O
still O
owned O
one N
. O

But O
there O
it O
was O
, O
hanging O
amidst O
the O
debris N
of O
his O
wardrobe N
. O

He O
dismissed O
a O
white O
shirt N
as O
too O
formal O
, O
however O
, O
and O
instead O
chose O
a O
gray O
and O
red O
check O
affair N
to O
go O
with O
the O
gray O
tie N
. O

He O
put O
them O
on O
in O
a O
kind N
of O
trance N
. O

It O
was O
not O
until O
he O
had O
his O
hand N
on O
the O
doorknob N
that O
he O
began O
to O
suspect O
what O
he O
was O
doing O
. O

I H
seem O
to O
be O
going O
out O
, O
he O
said O
to O
himself O
. O

But O
if O
I H
am O
going O
out O
, O
where O
exactly O
am O
I H
going O
? O

An O
hour N
later O
, O
as O
he O
climbed O
from O
the O
number N
4 O
bus N
at O
70th O
Street N
and O
Fifth O
Avenue O
, O
he O
still O
had O
not O
answered O
the O
question N
. O

To O
one N
side N
of O
him O
was O
the O
park N
, O
green O
in O
the O
morning N
sun N
, O
with O
sharp O
, O
fleeting O
shadows N
; O
to O
the O
other O
side N
was O
the O
Frick O
, O
white O
and O
austere O
, O
as O
if O
abandoned O
to O
the O
dead O
. O

He O
thought O
for O
a O
moment N

, O
trying O

the O
girl's O
girl H
's H
face N
, O
the O
exact O
position N
of O
her O
hands N
around O
the O
cup N
, O
the O
red O
back O
of O
the O
faceless O
man H
. O

In O
his O
mind N
, O
he O
caught O
a O
glimpse N
of O
the O
blue O
map N
on O
the O
wall N
and O
the O
sunlight N
pouring O
through O
the O
window N
, O
so O
like O
the O
sunlight N
that O
surrounded O
him O
now O
. O

He O
was O
walking O
. O

He O
was O
crossing O
the O
street N
and O
moving O
eastward O
. O

At O
Madison O
Avenue O
he O
turned O
right O
and O
went O
south O
for O
a O
block O
, O
then O
turned O
left O
and O
saw O
where O
he O
was O
. O

I H
seem O
to O
have O
arrived O
, O
he O
said O
to O
himself O
. O

He O
stood O
before O
the O
building N
and O
paused O
. O

It O
suddenly O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
matter N
anymore O
. O

He O
felt N
remarkably O
calm O
, O
as O
if O
everything O
had O
already O
happened O
to O
him O
. O

As O
he O
opened O
the O
door N
that O
would O
lead O
him O
into O
the O
lobby N
, O
he O
gave O
himself O
one N
last O
word N
of O
advice N
. O

If O
all O
this O
is O
really O
happening O
, O
he O
said O
, O
then O
I H
must O
keep O
my H
eyes N
open O
. O

It O
was O
a O
woman H
who O
opened O
the O
apartment N
door N
. O

For O
some O
reason N
, O
Quinn H
had O
not O
expected O
this O
, O
and O
it O
threw O
him O
off O
track N
. O

Already O
, O
things N
were O
happening O
too O
fast O
. O

Before O
he O
had O
a O
chance N
to O
absorb O
the O
woman's O
woman H
's H
presence N
, O
to O
describe O
her O
to O
himself O
and O
form N
his O
impressions N
, O
she O
was O
talking O
to O
him O
, O
forcing O
him O
to O
respond O
. O

Therefore O
, O
even O
in O
those O
first O
moments N
, O
he O
had O
lost O
ground N
, O
was O
starting O
to O
fall N
behind O
himself O
. O

Later O
, O
when O
he O
had O
time N
to O
reflect O
on O
these O
events N
, O
he O
would O
manage O
to O
piece N
together O
his O
encounter N
with O
the O
woman H
. O

But O
that O
was O
the O
work N
of O
memory N
, O
and O
remembered O
things N
, O
he O
knew O
, O
had O
a O
tendency N
to O
subvert O
the O
things N
remembered O
. O

As O
a O
consequence N
, O
he O
could O
never O
be O
sure O
of O
any O
of O
it O
. O

The O
woman H
was O
thirty O
, O
perhaps O
thirty-five O
; O
average O
height N
at O
best O
; O
hips N
a O
touch O
wide O
, O
or O
else O
voluptuous O
, O
depending O
on O
your H
point N
of O
view N
; O
dark O
hair N
, O
dark O
eyes N
, O
and O
a O
look O
in O
those O
eyes N
that O
was O
at O
once O
self-contained O
and O
vaguely O
seductive O
. O

She O
wore O
a O
black O
dress O
and O
very O
red O
lipstick N
. O

Mr N
Auster O
? O
A O
tentative O
smile O
; O
a O
questioning O
tilt O
to O
the O
head N
. O

That's O
That O
's H
right O
, O
said O
Quinn H
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
Virginia H
Stillman O
, O
the O
woman H
began O
. O

Peter's O
Peter H
's H
wife H
. O

He's O
He O
's H
been O
waiting O
for O
you H
since O
eight O
o'clock O
. O

The O
appointment N
was O
for O
ten O
, O
said O
Quinn H
, O
glancing O
at O
his O
watch O
. O

It O
was O
exactly O
ten O
. O

He's O
He O
's H
been O
frantic O
, O
the O
woman H
explained O
. O

I've O
I H
've O
never O
seen O
him O
like O
this O
before O
. O

He O
just O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
wait N
. O

She O
opened O
the O
door N
for O
Quinn H
. O

As O
he O
crossed O
the O
threshold N
and O
entered O
the O
apartment N
, O
he O
could O
feel O
himself O
going O
blank O
, O
as O
if O
his O
brain N
had O
suddenly O
shut O
off O
. O

He O
had O
wanted O
to O
take O
in O
the O
details N
of O
what O
he O
was O
seeing O
, O
but O
the O
task N
was O
somehow O
beyond O
him O
at O
that O
moment N
. O

The O
apartment N
loomed O
up O
around O
him O
as O
a O
kind N
of O
blur O
. O

He O
realized O
that O
it O
was O
large O
, O
perhaps O
five O
or O
six O
rooms N
, O
and O
that O
it O
was O
richly O
furnished O
, O
with O
numerous O
art N
objects N
, O
silver N
ashtrays N
, O
and O
elaborately O
framed O
paintings N
on O
the O
walls N
. O

But O
that O
was O
all O
. O

No O
more O
than O
a O
general O
impression N
– O
even O
though O
he O
was O
there O
, O
looking O
at O
those O
things N
with O
his O
own O
eyes N
. O

He O
found O
himself O
sitting O
on O
a O
sofa N
, O
alone O
in O
the O
living O
room N
. O

He O
remembered O
now O
that O
Mrs. O
Stillman O
had O
told O
him O
to O
wait N
there O
while O
she O
went O
to O
find O
her O
husband H
. O

He O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
say O
how O
long O
it O
had O
been O
. O

Surely O
no O
more O
than O
a O
minute O
or O
two O
. O

But O
from O
the O
way N
the O
light N
was O
coming O
through O
the O
windows N
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
be O
almost O
noon N
. O

It O
did O
not O
occur O
to O
him O
, O
however O
, O
to O
consult O
his O
watch O
. O

The O
smell O
of O
Virginia H
Stillman's O
Stillman O
's H
perfume N
hovered O
around O
him O
, O
and O
he O
began O
to O
imagine O
what O
she O
looked O
like O
without O
any O
clothes N
on O
. O

Then O
he O
thought O
about O
what O
Max H
Work H
might O
have O
been O
thinking O
, O
had O
he O
been O
there O
. O

He O
decided O
to O
light N
a O
cigarette N
. O

He O
blew O
the O
smoke O
into O
the O
room N
. O

It O
pleased O
him O
to O
watch O
it O
leave O
his O
mouth N
in O
gusts N
, O
disperse O
, O
and O
take O
on O
new O
definition N
as O
the O
light N
caught O
it O
. O

He O
heard O
the O
sound N
of O
someone H
entering O
the O
room N
behind O
him O
. O

Quinn H
stood O
up O
from O
the O
sofa N
and O
turned O
around O
, O
expecting O
to O
see O
Mrs. O
Stillman O
. O

Instead O
, O
it O
was O
a O
young O
man H
, O
dressed O
entirely O
in O
white O
, O
with O
the O
white-blond O
hair N
of O
a O
child H
. O

Uncannily O
, O
in O
that O
first O
moment N
, O
Quinn H
thought O
of O
his O
own O
dead O
son H
. O

Then O
, O
just O
as O
suddenly O
as O
the O
thought O
had O
appeared O
, O
it O
vanished O
. O

Peter H
Stillman O
walked O
into O
the O
room N
and O
sat O
down O
in O
a O
red O
velvet N
armchair N
opposite N
Quinn H
. O

He O
said O
not O
a O
word N
as O
he O
made O
his O
way N
to O
his O
seat N
, O
nor O
did O
he O
acknowledge O
Quinn's O
Quinn H
's H
presence N
. O

The O
act N
of O
moving O
from O
one N
place N
to O
another O
seemed O
to O
require O
all O
his O
attention N
, O
as O
though O
not O
to O
think O
of O
what O
he O
was O
doing O
would O
reduce O
him O
to O
immobility N
. O

Quinn H
had O
never O
seen O
anyone O
move O
in O
such O
a O
manner N
, O
and O
he O
realized O
at O
once O
that O
this O
was O
the O
same O
person H
he O
had O
spoken O
to O
on O
the O
phone N
. O

The O
body N
acted O
almost O
exactly O
as O
the O
voice H
had O
: O
machine-like O
, O
fitful O
, O
alternating O
between O
slow O
and O
rapid O
gestures N
, O
rigid O
and O
yet O
expressive O
, O
as O
if O
the O
operation N
were O
out O
of O
control N
, O
not O
quite O
corresponding O
to O
the O
will O
that O
lay O
behind O
it O
. O

It O
seemed O
to O
Quinn H
that O
Stillman's O
Stillman O
's H
body N
had O
not O
been O
used O
for O
a O
long O
time N
and O
that O
all O
its O
functions N
had O
been O
relearned O
, O
so O
that O
motion N
had O
become O
a O
conscious O
process N
, O
each O
movement N
broken O
down O
into O
its O
component N
submovements O
, O
with O
the O
result N
that O
all O
flow N
and O
spontaneity N
had O
been O
lost O
. O

It O
was O
like O
watching O
a O
marionette N
trying O
to O
walk O
without O
strings N
. O

Everything O
about O
Peter H
Stillman O
was O
white O
. O

White O
shirt N
, O
open O
at O
the O
neck N
; O
white O
pants N
, O
white O
shoes N
, O
white O
socks N
. O

Against O
the O
pallor N
of O
his O
skin N
, O
the O
flaxen O
thinness N
of O
his O
hair N
, O
the O
effect N
was O
almost O
transparent O
, O
as O
though O
one N
could O
see O
through O
to O
the O
blue O
veins N
behind O
the O
skin N
of O
his O
face N
. O

This O
blue O
was O
almost O
the O
same O
as O
his O
eyes N
: O
a O
milky O
blue O
that O
seemed O
to O
dissolve O
into O
a O
mixture N
of O
sky O
and O
clouds N
. O

Quinn H
could O
not O
imagine O
himself O
addressing O
a O
word N
to O
this O
person H
. O

It O
was O
as O
though O
Stillman's O
Stillman O
's H
presence N
was O
a O
command O
to O
be O
silent O
. O

Stillman O
settled O
slowly O
into O
his O
chair N
and O
at O
last O
turned O
his O
attention N
to O
Quinn H
. O

As O
their O
eyes N
met O
, O
Quinn H
suddenly O
felt N
that O
Stillman O
had O
become O
invisible O
. O

He O
could O
see O
him O
sitting O
in O
the O
chair N
across O
from O
him O
, O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time N
it O
felt N
as O
though O
he O
was O
not O
there O
. O

It O
occurred O
to O
Quinn H
that O
perhaps O
Stillman O
was O
blind O
. O

But O
no O
, O
that O
did O
not O
seem O
possible O
. O

The O
man H
was O
looking O
at O
him O
, O
even O
studying O
him O
, O
and O
if O
recognition N
did O
not O
flicker O
across O
his O
face N
, O
it O
still O
held O
something O
more O
than O
a O
blank O
stare O
. O

Quinn H
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
do O
. O

He O
sat O
there O
dumbly O
in O
his O
seat N
, O
looking O
back O
at O
Stillman O
. O

A O
long O
time N
passed O
. O

No O
questions N
, O
please O
, O
the O
young O
man H
said O
at O
last O
. O

Yes O
. O
No O
. O
Thank O
you H
. O

He O
paused O
for O
a O
moment N
. O

I H
am O
Peter H
Stillman O
. O

I H
say O
this O
of O
my H
free O
will O
. O
Yes O
. O

That O
is O
not O
my H
real O
name N
. O
No O
. O

Of O
course N
, O
my H
mind N
is O
not O
all O
it O
should O
be O
. O

But O
nothing N
can O
be O
done O
about O
that O
. O
No O
. O
About O
that O
. O
No O
, O
no O
. O
Not O
anymore O
. O

You H
sit O
here O
and O
think O
: O
who O
is O
this O
person H
talking O
to O
me H
? O

What O
are O
these O
words N
coming O
from O
his O
mouth N
? O

I H
will O
tell O
you H
. O

Or O
else O
I H
will O
not O
tell O
you H
. O

At O
the O
corner N
of O
72nd O
Street N
and O
Madison O
Avenue O
, O
he O
waved O
down O
a O
cab N
. O

As O
the O
car N
rattled O
through O
the O
park N
toward O
the O
West O
Side N
, O
Quinn H
looked O
out O
the O
window N
and O
wondered O
if O
these O
were O
the O
same O
trees A
that O
Peter H
Stillman O
saw O
when O
he O
walked O
out O
into O
the O
air N
and O
the O
light N
. O

He O
wondered O
if O
Peter H
saw O
the O
same O
things N
as O
he O
did O
, O
or O
whether O
the O
world N
was O
a O
different O
place N
for O
him O
. O

And O
if O
a O
tree A
was O
not O
a O
tree A
, O
he O
wondered O
what O
it O
really O
was O
. O

After O
the O
cab N
had O
dropped O
him O
off O
in O
front N
of O
his O
house N
, O
Quinn H
realized O
that O
he O
was O
hungry O
. O

He O
had O
not O
eaten O
since O
breakfast N
early O
that O
morning N
. O

It O
was O
strange O
, O
he O
thought O
, O
how O
quickly O
time N
had O
passed O
in O
the O
Stillman O
apartment N
. O

If O
his O
calculations N
were O
correct O
, O
he O
had O
been O
there O
for O
more O
than O
fourteen N
hours N
. O

Within O
himself O
, O
however O
, O
it O
felt N
as O
though O
his O
stay O
had O
lasted O
three O
or O
four O
hours N
at O
most O
. O

He O
shrugged O
at O
the O
discrepancy N
and O
said O
to O
himself O
, O
I H
must O
learn O
to O
look O
at O
my H
watch O
more O
often O
. O

He O
retraced O
his O
path N
along O
107th O
Street N
, O
turned O
left O
on O
Broadway O
, O
and O
began O
walking O
uptown O
, O
looking O
for O
a O
suitable O
place N
to O
eat O
. O

A O
bar N
did O
not O
appeal O
to O
him O
tonight N
– O
eating O
in O
the O
dark O
, O
the O
press N
of O
boozy O
chatter N
– O
although O
normally O
he O
would O
have O
welcomed O
it O
. O

As O
he O
crossed O
112th O
Street N
, O
he O
saw O
that O
the O
Heights O
Luncheonette O
was O
still O
open O
and O
decided O
to O
go O
in O
. O

It O
was O
a O
brightly O
lit O
yet O
dreary O
place N
, O
with O
a O
large O
rack N
of O
girlie O
magazines N
on O
one N
wall N
, O
an O
area N
for O
stationery N
supplies N
, O
another O
area N
for O
newspapers N
, O
several O
tables N
for O
patrons H
, O
and O
a O
long O
Formica O
counter N
with O
swivel N
stools N
. O

A O
tall O
Puerto O
Rican O
man H
in O
a O
white O
cardboard O
chef's O
chef H
's H
hat N
stood O
behind O
the O
counter N
. O

It O
was O
his O
job N
to O
make O
the O
food N
, O
which O
consisted O
mainly O
of O
gristle-studded O
hamburger N
patties N
, O
bland O
sandwiches N
with O
pale O
tomatoes N
and O
wilted O
lettuce N
, O
milkshakes N
, O
egg A
creams O
, O
and O
buns N
. O

To O
his O
right O
, O
ensconced O
behind O
the O
cash N
register N
, O
was O
the O
boss A
, O
a O
small O
balding O
man H
with O
curly O
hair N
and O
a O
concentration N
camp N
number N
tattoed O
on O
his O
forearm N
, O

lording O
it O
over O
his O
domain N
of O
cigarettes N
, O
pipes N
, O
and O
cigars N
. O

He O
sat O
there O
impassively O
, O
reading O
the O
night-owl O
edition N
of O
the O
next O
morning's O
morning N
's H
Daily O
News O
. O

The O
place N
was O
almost O
deserted O
at O
that O
hour N
. O

He O
would O
arrive O
early O
, O
never O
later O
than O
seven O
o'clock O
and O
sit O
there O
with O
a O
take-out O
coffee N
, O
a O
buttered O
roll O
, O
and O
an O
open O
newspaper N
on O
his O
lap O
, O
watching O
the O
glass N
door N
of O
the O
hotel N
. O

By O
eight O
o'clock O
Stillman O
would O
come O
out O
, O
always O
in O
his O
long O
brown O
overcoat N
, O
carrying O
a O
large O
, O
old-fashioned O
carpet N
bag N
. O

For O
two O
weeks N
this O
routine N
did O
not O
vary O
. O
The O
old O
man H
would O
wander O
through O
the O
streets N
of O
the O
neighborhood N
, O
advancing O
slowly O
, O
sometimes O
by O
the O
merest O
of O
increments N
, O
pausing O
, O
moving O
on O
again O
, O
pausing O
once O
more O
, O
as O
though O
each O
step O
had O
to O
be O
weighed O
and O
measured O
before O
it O
could O
take O
its O
place N
among O
the O
sum N
total N
of O
steps N
. O

Moving O
in O
this O
manner N
was O
difficult O
for O
Quinn H
. O

He O
was O
used O
to O
walking O
briskly O
, O
and O
all O
this O
starting O
and O
stopping O
and O
shuffling O
began O
to O
be O
a O
strain O
, O
as O
though O
the O
rhythm N
of O
his O
body N
was O
being O
disrupted O
. O

He O
was O
hare A
in O
pursuit N
of O
the O
tortoise A
, O
and O
again O
and O
again O
he O
had O
to O
remind O
himself O
to O
hold O
back O
. O

What O
Stillman O
did O
on O
these O
walks O
remained O
something O
of O
a O
mystery N
to O
Quinn H
. O

He O
could O
, O
of O
course N
, O
see O
with O
his O
own O
eyes N
what O
happened O
, O
and O
all O
these O
things N
he O
dutifully O
recorded O
in O
his O
red O
notebook N
. O
But O
the O
meaning N
of O
these O
things N
continued O
to O
elude O
him O
. O

Stillman O
never O
seemed O
to O
be O
going O
anywhere O
in O
particular O
, O
nor O
did O
he O
seem O
to O
know O
where O
he O
was O
. O

and O
yet O
, O
as O
if O
by O
conscious O
design N
, O
he O
kept O
to O
a O
narrowly O
circumscribed O
area N
, O
bounded O
on O
the O
north O
by O
Riverside O
Park N
, O
and O
on O
the O
east O
by O
Amsterdam O
Avenue O
. O

No O
matter N
how O
haphazard O
his O
journeys N
seemed O
to O
be O
– O
and O
each O
day N
his O
itinerary N
was O
different O
– O
Stillman O
never O
crossed O
these O
borders N
. O

Such O
precision N
baffled O
Quinn H
, O
for O
in O
all O
other O
respects N
Stillman O
seemed O
to O
be O
aimless O
. O

As O
he O
walked O
, O
Stillman O
did O
not O
look O
up O
. O

His O
eyes N
were O
permanently O
fixed O
on O
the O
pavement N
, O
as O
though O
he O
were O
searching O
for O
something O
. O

Indeed O
, O
every O
now O
and O
then O
he O
would O
stoop O
down O
, O
pick O
some O
object N
off O
the O
ground N
, O
and O
examine O
it O
closely O
, O
turning O
it O
over O
and O
over O
in O
his O
hand N
. O

It O
made O
Quinn H
think O
of O
an O
archeologist H
inspecting O
a O
shard N
at O
some O
prehistoric O
ruin N
. O

Occasionally O
, O
after O
poring O
over O
an O
object N
in O
this O
way N
, O
Stillman O
would O
toss O
it O
back O
onto O
the O
sidewalk N
. O
But O
more O
often O
than O
not O
he O
would O
open O
his O
bag N
and O
lay O
the O
object N
gently O
inside O
it O
. O

Then O
, O
reaching O
into O
one N
of O
his O
coat N
pockets N
, O
he O
would O
remove O
a O
red O
notebook N
– O
similar O
to O
Quinn's O
Quinn H
's H
but O
smaller O
– O
and O
write O
in O
it O
with O
great O
concentration N
for O
a O
minute O
or O
two O
. O

Having O
completed O
this O
operation N
, O
he O
would O
return O
the O
notebook N
to O
his O
pocket N
, O
pick O
up O
his O
bag N
, O
and O
continue O
on O
his O
way N
. O

As O
far O
as O
Quinn H
could O
tell O
, O
the O
objects N
Stillman O
collected O
were O
valueless O
. O

They O
seemed O
to O
be O
no O
more O
than O
broken O
things N
, O
discarded O
things N
, O
stray O
bits N
of O
junk N
. O

Over O
the O
days N
that O
passed O
, O
Quinn H
noted O
a O
collapsible O
umbrella N
shorn O
of O
its O
material O
, O
the O
severed O
head N
of O
a O
rubber N
doll N
, O
a O
black O
glove N
, O
the O
bottom N
of O
a O
shattered O
light N
bulb N
, O
several O
pieces N
of O
printed O
matter N
( O
sogged O
magazines N
, O
shredded O
newspapers N
) O
, O
a O
torn O
photograph N
, O
anonymous O
machinery N
parts N
, O
and O
sundry O
other O
clumps N
of O
flotsam N
he O
could O
not O
identify O
. O

The O
fact N
that O
Stillman O
took O
this O
scavenging O
seriously O
intrigued O
Quinn H
, O
but O
he O
could O
do O
no O
more O
than O
observe O
, O
write O
down O
what O
he O
saw O
in O
the O
red O
notebook N
, O
hover O
stupidly O
on O
the O
surface N
of O
things N
. O

At O
the O
same O
time N
, O
it O
pleased O
him O
to O
know O
that O
Stillman O
also O
had O
a O
red O
notebook N
, O
as O
if O
this O
formed O
a O
secret O
link N
between O
them O
. O

Quinn H
suspected O
that O
Stillman's O
Stillman O
's H
red O
notebook N
contained O
answers N
to O
the O
questions N
that O
had O
been O
accumulating O
in O
his O
mind N
, O
and O
he O
began O
to O
plot N
various O
stratagems N
for O
stealing O
it O
from O
the O
old O
man H
. O

But O
the O
time N
had O
not O
yet O
come O
for O
such O
a O
step O
. O

Other O
than O
picking O
up O
objects N
from O
the O
street N
, O
Stillman O
seemed O
to O
do O
nothing N
. O

Every O
now O
and O
then O
he O
would O
stop N
somewhere O
for O
a O
meal N
. O

Occasionally O
he O
would O
bump N
into O
someone H
and O
mumble O
an O
apology N
. O

Once O
a O
car N
nearly O
ran O
him O
over O
as O
he O
was O
crossing O
the O
street N
. O

Stillman O
did O
not O
talk O
to O
anyone O
, O
did O
not O
go O
into O
any O
stores N
, O
did O
not O
smile O
. O

He O
seemed O
neither O
happy O
nor O
sad O
. O

Twice O
, O
when O
his O
scavenging O
haul O
had O
been O
unusually O
large O
, O
he O
returned O
to O
the O
hotel N
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
day N
and O
remerged O
a O
few O
minutes N
later O
with O
an O
empty O
bag N
. O

On O
most O
days N
he O
spent O
at O
least O
several O
hours N
in O
Riverside O
Park N
, O
walking O
methodically O
along O
the O
macadam N
footpaths N
or O
else O
thrashing O
through O
the O
bushes A
with O
a O
stick N
. O

His O
quest N
for O
objects N
did O
not O
abate O
amidst O
the O
greenery N
. O

Stones O
, O
leaves N
, O
and O
twigs N
all O
found O
their O
way N
into O
his O
bag N
. O

Once O
, O
Quinn H
observed O
, O
he O
even O
stooped O
down O
for O
a O
dried O
dog A
turd N
, O
sniffed O
it O
carefully O
, O
and O
kept O
it O
. O

It O
was O
in O
the O
park N
, O
too O
, O
that O
Stillman O
rested O
. O

In O
the O
afternoon N
, O
often O
following O
his O
lunch N
, O
he O
would O
sit O
on O
a O
bench N
and O
gaze O
out O
across O
the O
Hudson O
. O

Once O
, O
on O
a O
particularly O
warm O
day N
, O
Quinn H
saw O
him O
sprawled O
out O
on O
the O
grass A
asleep O
. O

When O
darkness N
came O
, O
Stillman O
would O
eat O
dinner N
at O
the O
Apollo O
Coffee N
Shop O
on O
97th O
Street N
and O
Broadway O
and O
then O
return O
to O
his O
hotel N
for O
the O
night N
. O

Not O
once O
did O
he O
try O
to O
contact O
his O
son H
. O

This O
was O
confirmed O
by O
Virginia H
Stillman O
, O
whom O
Quinn H
called O
each O
night N
after O
returning O
home N
. O

The O
essential O
thing N
was O
to O
stay O
involved O
. O

Little O
by O
little O
, O
Quinn H
began O
to O
feel O
cut O
off O
from O
his O
original O
intentions N
, O
and O
he O
wondered O
now O
if O
he O
had O
not O
embarked O
on O
a O
meaningless O
project N
. O

It O
was O
possible O
, O
of O
course N
, O
that O
Stillman O
was O
merely O
biding O
his O
time N
, O
lulling O
the O
world N
into O
lethargy N
before O
striking O
. O

But O
that O
would O
assume O
he O
was O
aware O
of O
being O
watched O
, O
and O
Quinn H
felt N
that O
was O
unlikely O
. O

He O
had O
done O
his O
job N
well O
so O
far O
, O
keeping N
at O
a O
discreet O
distance N
from O
the O
old O
man H
, O
blending O
into O
the O
traffic N
of O
the O
street N
, O
neither O
calling O
attention N
to O
himself O
nor O
taking O
drastic O
measures N
to O
keep O
himself O
hidden O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand N
, O
it O
was O
possible O
that O
Stillman O
had O
known O
all O
along O
that O
he O
would O
be O
watched O
– O
had O
even O
known O
it O
in O
advance N
– O
and O
therefore O
had O
not O
taken O
the O
trouble N
to O
discover O
who O
the O
particular O
watcher H
was O
. O

If O
being O
followed O
was O
a O
certainty N
, O
what O
did O
it O
matter N
? O

A O
watcher H
, O
once O
discovered O
, O
could O
always O
be O
replaced O
by O
another O
. O

This O
view N
of O
the O
situation N
comforted O
Quinn H
, O
and O
he O
decided O
to O
believe O
in O
it O
, O
even O
though O
he O
had O
no O
grounds N
for O
belief N
. O

Either O
Stillman O
knew O
what O
he O
was O
doing O
or O
he O
didn't O
did O
n't O
. O

and O
if O
he O
didn't O
did O
n't O
, O
then O
Quinn H
was O
going O
nowhere O
, O
was O
wasting O
his O
time N
. O

How O
much O
better O
it O
was O
to O
believe O
that O
all O
his O
steps N
were O
actually O
to O
some O
purpose N
. O

If O
this O
interpretation N
required O
knowledge N
on O
Stillman's O
Stillman O
's H
part N
, O
then O
Quinn H
would O
accept O
this O
knowledge N
as O
an O
article N
of O
faith N
, O
at O
least O
for O
the O
time N
being O
. O

There O
remained O
the O
problem N
of O
how O
to O
occupy O
his O
thoughts N
as O
he O
followed O
the O
old O
man H
. O

Quinn H
was O
used O
to O
wandering O
. O

His O
excursions N
through O
the O
city N
had O
taught O
him O
to O
understand O
the O
connectedness N
of O
inner O
and O
outer O
. O

Using O
aimless O
motion N
as O
a O
technique N
of O
reversal N
, O
on O
his O
best O
days N
he O
could O
bring O
the O
outside O
in O
and O
thus O
usurp O
the O
sovereignty N
of O
inwardness N
. O

By O
flooding O
himself O
with O
externals N
, O
by O
drowning O
himself O
out O
of O
himself O
, O
he O
had O
managed O
to O
exert O
some O
small O
degree N
of O
control N
over O
his O
fits O
of O
despair N
. O

Wandering O
, O
therefore O
, O
was O
a O
kind N
of O
mindlessness N
. O

But O
following O
Stillman O
was O
not O
wandering O
. O

Stillman O
could O
wander O
, O
he O
could O
stagger O
like O
a O
blindman O
from O
one N
spot N
to O
another O
, O
but O
this O
was O
a O
privilege N
denied O
to O
Quinn H
. O

For O
he O
was O
obliged O
now O
to O
concentrate O
on O
what O
he O
was O
doing O
, O
even O
if O
it O
was O
next O
to O
nothing N
. O

Time N
and O
again O
his O
thoughts N
would O
begin O
to O
drift O
, O
and O
soon O
thereafter O
his O
steps N
would O
follow O
suit N
. O

This O
meant O
that O
he O
was O
constantly O
in O
danger N
of O
quickening O
his O
pace N
and O
crashing O
into O
Stillman O
from O
behind O
. O

To O
guard O
against O
this O
mishap N
he O
devised O
several O
different O
methods N
of O
deceleration N
. O

The O
first O
was O
to O
tell O
himself O
that O
he O
was O
no O
longer O
Daniel H
Quinn H
. O

He O
was O
Paul H
Auster O
now O
, O
and O
with O
each O
step O
he O
took O
he O
tried O
to O
fit O
more O
comfortably O
into O
the O
strictures N
of O
that O
transformation N
. O

Auster O
was O
no O
more O
than O
a O
name N
to O
him O
, O
a O
husk N
without O
content N
. O

To O
be O
Auster O
meant O
being O
a O
man H
with O
no O
interior N
, O
a O
man H
with O
no O
thoughts N
. O

Stillman O
was O
gone O
now O
. O

The O
old O
man H
had O
become O
part N
of O
the O
city N
. O

He O
was O
a O
speck N
, O
a O
punctuation N
mark N
, O
a O
brick N
in O
an O
endless O
wall N
of O
bricks N
. O

Quinn H
could O
walk O
through O
the O
streets N
every O
day N
for O
the O
rest N
of O
his O
life N
, O
and O
still O
he O
would O
not O
find O
him O
. O

Everything O
had O
been O
reduced O
to O
chance N
, O
a O
nightmare N
of O
numbers N
and O
probabilities N
. O

There O
were O
no O
clues N
, O
no O
leads O
, O
no O
moves O
to O
be O
made O
. O

Quinn H
backtracked O
in O
his O
mind N
to O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
case N
. O

His O
job N
had O
been O
to O
protect O
Peter H
, O
not O
to O
follow O
Stillman O
. O

That O
had O
simply O
been O
a O
method N
, O
a O
way N
of O
trying O
to O
predict O
what O
would O
happen O
. O

By O
watching O
Stillman O
, O
the O
theory N
was O
that O
he O
would O
learn O
what O
his O
intentions N
were O
toward O
Peter H
. O

He O
had O
followed O
the O
old O
man H
for O
two O
weeks N
. O

What O
, O
then O
, O
could O
he O
conclude O
? O

Not O
much O
. O

Stillman's O
Stillman O
's H
behavior N
had O
been O
too O
obscure O
to O
give O
any O
hints N
. O

There O
were O
, O
of O
course N
, O
certain O
extreme O
measures N
that O
they O
could O
take O
. O

He O
could O
suggest O
to O
Virginia H
Stillman O
that O
she O
get O
an O
unlisted O
telephone N
number N
. O

That O
would O
eliminate O
the O
disturbing O
calls O
, O
at O
least O
temporarily O
. O

If O
that O
failed O
, O
she O
and O
Peter H
could O
move O
. O

They O
could O
leave O
the O
neighborhood N
, O
perhaps O
leave O
the O
city N
altogether O
. O

At O
the O
very O
worst O
, O
they O
could O
take O
on O
new O
identities N
, O
live O
under O
different O
names N
. O

This O
last O
thought O
reminded O
him O
of O
something O
important O
. O

Until O
now O
, O
he O
realized O
, O
he O
had O
never O
seriously O
questioned O
the O
circumstances N
of O
his O
hiring O
. O

Things N
had O
happened O
too O
quickly O
, O
and O
he O
had O
taken O
it O
for O
granted O
that O
he O
could O
fill O
in O
for O
Paul H
Auster O
. O

Once O
he O
had O
taken O
the O
leap O
into O
that O
name N
, O
he O
had O
stopped O
thinking O
about O
Auster O
himself O
. O

If O
this O
man H
was O
as O
good O
a O
detective H
as O
the O
Stillmans O
thought O
he O
was O
, O
perhaps O
he O
would O
be O
able O
to O
help O
with O
the O
case N
. O

Quinn H
would O
make O
a O
clean O
breast N
of O
it O
, O
Auster O
would O
forgive O
him O
, O
and O
together O
they O
would O
work N
to O
save O
Peter H
Stillman O
. O

He O
looked O
through O
the O
yellow O
pages N
for O
the O
Auster O
Detective H
Agency O
. O

There O
was O
no O
listing O
. O

In O
the O
white O
pages N
, O
however O
, O
he O
found O
the O
name N
. O

There O
was O
one N
Paul H
Auster O
in O
Manhattan O
, O
living O
on O
Riverside O
Drive O
– O
not O
far O
from O
Quinn's O
Quinn H
's H
own O
house N
. O

There O
was O
no O
mention N
of O
a O
detective H
agency N
, O
but O
that O
did O
not O
necessarily O
mean O
anything O
. O

It O
could O
be O
that O
Auster O
had O
so O
much O
work N
he O
didn't O
did O
n't O
need O
to O
advertise O
. O

Quinn H
picked O
up O
the O
phone N
and O
was O
about O
to O
dial N
when O
he O
thought O
better O
of O
it O
. O

This O
was O
too O
important O
a O
conversation N
to O
leave O
to O
the O
phone N
. O

He O
did O
not O
want O
to O
run O
the O
risk N
of O
being O
brushed O
off O
. O

Since O
Auster O
did O
not O
have O
an O
office N
, O
that O
meant O
he O
worked O
at O
home N
. O

Quinn H
would O
go O
there O
and O
talk O
to O
him O
face N
to O
face N
. O

The O
rain N
had O
stopped O
now O
, O
and O
although O
the O
sky O
was O
still O
gray O
, O
far O
to O
the O
west O
Quinn H
could O
see O
a O
tiny O
shift N
of O
light N
seeping O
through O
the O
clouds N
. O

As O
he O
walked O
up O
Riverside O
Drive O
, O
he O
became O
aware O
of O
the O
fact N
that O
he O
was O
no O
longer O
following O
Stillman O
. O

It O
felt N
as O
though O
he O
had O
lost O
half O
of O
himself O
. O

For O
two O
weeks N
he O
had O
been O
tied O
by O
an O
invisible O
thread N
to O
the O
old O
man H
. O

Whatever O
Stillman O
had O
done O
, O
he O
had O
done O
; O
wherever O
Stillman O
had O
gone O
, O
he O
had O
gone O
. O

His O
body N
was O
not O
accustomed O
to O
this O
new O
freedom N
, O
and O
for O
the O
first O
few O
blocks N
he O
walked O
at O
the O
old O
shuffling O
pace N
. O

The O
spell O
was O
over O
, O
and O
yet O
his O
body N
did O
not O
know O
it O
. O

Auster's O
Auster O
's H
building N
was O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
long O
block O
that O
ran O
between O
116th O
and O
119th O
Streets N
, O
just O
south O
of O
Riverside O
Church N
and O
Grant's O
Grant H
's H
Tomb N
. O

It O
was O
a O
well-kept O
place N
, O
with O
polished O
doorknobs N
and O
clean O
glass N
, O
and O
it O
had O
an O
air N
of O
bourgeois O
sobriety N
that O
appealed O
to O
Quinn H
at O
that O
moment N
. O

Auster's O
Auster O
's H
apartment N
was O
on O
the O
eleventh O
floor N
, O
and O
Quinn H
rang O
the O
buzzer N
, O
expecting O
to O
hear O
a O
voice H
speak O
to O
him O
through O
the O
intercom N
. O

But O
the O
door N
buzzer N
answered O
him O
without O
any O
conversation N
. O

Quinn H
pushed O
the O
door N
open O
, O
walked O
through O
the O
lobby N
, O
and O
rode O
the O
elevator N
to O
the O
eleventh O
floor N
. O

It O
was O
a O
man H
who O
opened O
the O
apartment N
door N
. O

He O
was O
a O
tall O
dark O
fellow H
in O
his O
mid-thirties N
, O
with O
rumpled O
clothes N
and O
a O
two-day O
beard N
. O

In O
his O
right O
hand N
, O
fixed O
between O
his O
thumb N
and O
first O
two O
fingers N
, O
he O
held O
an O
uncapped O
fountain N
pen N
, O
still O
poised O
in O
a O
writing N
position N
. O

The O
man H
seemed O
surprised O
to O
find O
a O
stranger H
standing N
before O
him O
. O

Yes O
? O
he O
asked O
tentatively O
. O

Quinn H
spoke O
in O
the O
politest O
tone N
he O
could O
muster O
. O
Were O
you H
expecting O
someone H
else O
? O

My H
wife H
, O
as O
a O
matter N
of O
fact N
. O

That's O
That O
's H
why O
I H
rang O
the O
buzzer N
without O
asking O
who O
it O
was O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
sorry O
to O
disturb O
you H
, O
Quinn H
apologized O
. O
But O
I'm O
I H
'm O
looking O
for O
Paul H
Auster O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
Paul H
Auster O
, O
said O
the O
man H
. O

I H
wonder O
if O
I H
could O
talk O
to O
you H
. O
It's O
It O
's H
quite O
important O
. O

You'll O
You H
'll O
have O
to O
tell O
me H
what O
it's O
it O
's H
about O
first O
. O

I H
hardly O
know O
myself H
. O
Quinn H
gave O
Auster O
an O
honest O
look O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
complicated O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
afraid O
. O
Very O
complicated O
. O

Do O
you H
have O
a O
name N
? O

I'm O
I H
'm O
sorry O
. O
Of O
course N
I H
do O
. O
Quinn H
. O

The O
name N
seemed O
to O
suggest O
something O
to O
Auster O
, O
and O
he O
paused O
for O
a O
moment N
abstractedly O
, O
as O
if O
searching O
through O
his O
memory N
. O

Quinn H
, O
he O
muttered O
to O
himself O
. O

I H
know O
that O
name N
from O
somewhere O
. O
He O
went O
silent O
again O
, O
straining O
harder O
to O
dredge O
up O
the O
answer N
. O

You H
aren't O
are O
n't O
a O
poet H
, O
are O
you H
? O

I H
used O
to O
be O
, O
said O
Quinn H
. O

But O
I H
haven't O
have O
n't O
written O
poems N
for O
a O
long O
time N
now O
. O

You H
did O
a O
book O
several O
years N
ago O
, O
didn't O
did O
n't O
you H
? O

I H
think O
the O
title N
was O
Unfinished O
Business N
. O

A O
little O
book O
with O
a O
blue O
cover O
. O

Yes O
. O
That O
was O
me H
. O

I H
liked O
it O
very O
much O
. O

I H
kept O
hoping O
to O
see O
more O
of O
your H
work N
. O

In O
fact N
, O
I H
even O
wondered O
what O
had O
happened O
to O
you H
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
still O
here O
. O
Sort N
of O
. O

Auster O
opened O
the O
door N
wider O
and O
gestured O
for O
Quinn H
to O
enter O
the O
apartment N
. O

It O
was O
a O
pleasant O
enough O
place N
inside O
; O
oddly O
shaped O
, O
with O
several O
long O
corridors N
, O
books N
cluttered O
everywhere O
, O
pictures N
on O
the O
walls N
by O
artists H
Quinn H
did O
not O
know O
, O
and O
a O
few O
children's O
children H
's H
toys N
scattered O
on O
the O
floor N
– O
a O
red O
truck N
, O
a O
brown O
bear O
, O
a O
green O
space N
monster A
. O

Auster O
led O
him O
to O
the O
living O
room N
, O
gave O
him O
a O
frayed O
upholstered O
chair N
to O
sit O
in O
, O
and O
then O
went O
off O
to O
the O
kitchen N
to O
fetch O
some O
beer N
. O

He O
returned O
with O
two O
bottles N
, O
placed O
them O
on O
a O
wooden O
crate N
that O
served O
as O
the O
coffee N
table N
, O
and O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
sofa N
across O
from O
Quinn H
. O

Was O
it O
some O
kind N
of O
literary O
thing N
you H
wanted O
to O
talk O
about O
? O
Auster O
began O
. O

No O
, O
said O
Quinn H
. O

In O
the O
end N
, O
they O
are O
actually O
successful O
. O

The O
book O
was O
just O
one N
of O
their O
ploys N
. O

The O
idea N
was O
to O
hold O
a O
mirror N
up O
to O
Don H
Quixote's O
Quixote O
's H
madness N
to O
record N
each O
of O
his O
absurd O
and O
ludicrous O
delusions N
, O
so O
that O
when O
he O
finally O
read O
the O
book O
himself O
, O
he O
would O
see O
the O
error N
of O
his O
ways N
. O

I H
like O
that O
. O

Yes O
. O
But O
there's O
there O
's H
one N
last O
twist N
. O

Don H
Quixote O
, O
in O
my H
view N
, O
was O
not O
really O
mad O
. O

He O
only O
pretended O
to O
be O
. O

In O
fact N
, O
he O
orchestrated O
the O
whole O
thing N
himself O
. O

Remember O
: O
throughout O
the O
book O
Don H
Quixote O
is O
preoccupied O
by O
the O
question N
of O
posterity A
. O

Again O
and O
again O
he O
wonders N
how O
accurately O
his O
chronicler H
will O
record N
his O
adventures N
. O

This O
implies O
knowledge N
on O
his O
part N
; O
he O
knows O
beforehand O
that O
this O
chronicler H
exists O
. O

And O
who O
else O
is O
it O
but O
Sancho O
Panza O
, O
the O
faithful O
squire H
whom O
Don H
Quixote O
has O
chosen O
for O
exactly O
this O
purpose N
? O

In O
the O
same O
way N
, O
he O
chose O
the O
three O
others O
to O
play O
the O
roles N
he O
destined O
for O
them O
. O

It O
was O
Don H
Quixote O
who O
engineered O
the O
Benengali O
quartet N
. O

And O
not O
only O
did O
he O
select O
the O
authors H
, O
it O
was O
probably O
he O
who O
translated O
the O
Arabic O
manuscript N
back O
into O
Spanish O
. O

We H
shouldn't O
should O
n't O
put O
it O
past N
him O
. O

For O
a O
man H
so O
skilled O
in O
the O
art N
of O
disguise O
, O
darkening O
his O
skin N
and O
donning O
the O
clothes N
of O
a O
Moor H
could O
not O
have O
been O
very O
difficult O
. O

I H
like O
to O
imagine O
that O
scene N
in O
the O
marketplace N
at O
Toledo N
. O

Cervantes O
hiring O
Don H
Quixote O
to O
decipher O
the O
story N
of O
Don H
Quixote O
himself O
. O

There's O
There O
's H
great O
beauty N
to O
it O
. O

But O
you H
still O
haven't O
have O
n't O
explained O
why O
a O
man H
like O
Don H
Quixote O
would O
disrupt O
his O
tranquil O
life N
to O
engage O
in O
such O
an O
elaborate O
hoax N
. O

That's O
That O
's H
the O
most O
interesting O
part N
of O
all O
. O

In O
my H
opinion N
, O
Don H
Quixote O
was O
conducting O
an O
experiment O
. O

He O
wanted O
to O
test N
the O
gullibility N
of O
his O
fellow H
men H
. O

Would O
it O
be O
possible O
, O
he O
wondered O
, O
to O
stand O
up O
before O
the O
world N
and O
with O
the O
utmost O
conviction N
spew O
out O
lies N
and O
nonsense N
? O

To O
say O
that O
windmills N
were O
knights O
, O
that O
a O
barber's O
barber H
's H
basin N
was O
a O
helmet N
, O
that O
puppets N
were O
real O
people N
? O

Would O
it O
be O
possible O
to O
persuade O
others O
to O
agree O
with O
what O
he O
said O
, O
even O
though O
they O
did O
not O
believe O
him O
? O

In O
other O
words N
, O
to O
what O
extent N
would O
people N
tolerate O
blasphemies N
if O
they O
gave O
them O
amusement N
? O

The O
answer N
is O
obvious O
, O
isn't O
is O
n't O
it O
? O

To O
any O
extent N
. O

For O
the O
proof N
is O
that O
we H
still O
read O
the O
book O
. O

It O
remains O
highly O
amusing O
to O
us H
. O

And O
that's O
that O
's H
finally O
all O
anyone O
wants O
out O
of O
a O
book O
– O
to O
be O
amused O
. O

Auster O
leaned O
back O
on O
the O
sofa N
, O
smiled O
with O
a O
certain O
ironic O
pleaure O
, O
and O
lit O
a O
cigarette N
. O

The O
man H
was O
obviously O
enjoying O
himself O
, O
but O
the O
precise O
nature N
of O
that O
pleasure N
eluded O
Quinn H
. O

It O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
kind N
of O
soundless O
laughter N
, O
a O
joke N
that O
stopped O
short O
of O
its O
punchline O
, O
a O
generalized O
mirth N
that O
had O
no O
object N
. O

Quinn H
was O
about O
to O
say O
something O
in O
response N
to O
Auster's O
Auster O
's H
theory N
, O
but O
he O
was O
not O
given O
the O
chance N
. O

Just O
as O
he O
opened O
his O
mouth N
to O
speak O
, O
he O
was O
interrupted O
by O
a O
clattering O
of O
keys N
at O
the O
front N
door N
, O
the O
sound N
of O
the O
door N
opening N
and O
then O
slamming O
shut O
, O
and O
a O
burst O
of O
voices N
. O

Auster's O
Auster O
's H
face N
perked O
up O
at O
the O
sound N
. O

He O
rose O
from O
his O
seat N
, O
excused O
himself O
to O
Quinn H
, O
and O
walked O
quickly O
towards O
the O
door N
. O

Quinn H
heard O
laughter N
in O
the O
hallway N
, O
first O
from O
a O
woman H
and O
then O
from O
a O
child H
– O
the O
high O
and O
the O
higher O
, O
a O
staccato O
of O
ringing O
shrapnel N
– O
and O
then O
the O
basso H
rumbling O
of O
Auster's O
Auster O
's H
guffaw N
. O

The O
child H
spoke O
: O
Daddy O
, O
look O
what O
I H
found O
! O

And O
then O
the O
woman H
explained O
that O
it O
had O
been O
lying O
on O
the O
street N
, O
and O
why O
not O
, O
it O
seemed O
perfectly O
okay O
. O

A O
moment N
later O
he O
heard O
the O
child H
running O
towards O
him O
down O
the O
hall N
. O
The O
child H
shot N
into O
the O
living O
room N
, O
caught O
sight N
of O
Quinn H
, O
and O
stopped O
dead O
in O
his O
tracks N
. O

He O
was O
a O
blond-haired O
boy H
of O
five O
or O
six O
. O

Good O
afternoon N
, O
said O
Quinn H
. O

The O
boy H
, O
rapidly O
withdrawing O
into O
shyness N
, O
managed O
no O
more O
than O
a O
faint O
hello O
. O

In O
his O
left O
hand N
he O
held O
a O
red O
object N
that O
Quinn H
could O
not O
identify O
. O

Quinn H
asked O
the O
boy H
what O
it O
was O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
a O
yoyo O
, O
he O
answered O
, O
opening N
his O
hand N
to O
show O
him O
. O

I H
found O
it O
on O
the O
street N
. O

Does O
it O
work N
? O

The O
boy H
gave O
an O
exaggerated O
pantomine O
shrug N
. O

Dunno O
. O

Siri O
can't O
ca O
n't O
do O
it O
. O
And O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
. O

Quinn H
asked O
him O
if O
he O
could O
try O
, O
and O
the O
boy H
walked O
over O
and O
put O
it O
in O
his O
hand N
. O

As O
he O
examined O
the O
yoyo O
, O
he O
could O
hear O
the O
child H
breathing N
beside O
him O
, O
watching O
his O
every O
move O
. O

The O
yoyo O
was O
plastic N
, O
similar O
to O
the O
ones N
he O
had O
played O
with O
years N
ago O
, O
but O
more O
elaborate O
somehow O
, O
an O
artifact N
of O
the O
space N
age N
. O

Quinn H
fastened O
the O
loop N
at O
the O
end N
of O
the O
string N
around O
his O
middle O
finger N
, O
stood O
up O
, O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
try O
. O

The O
yoyo O
gave O
off O
a O
fluted O
, O
whistling O
sound N
as O
it O
descended O
, O
and O
sparks N
shot N
off O
inside O
it O
. O

The O
boy H
gasped O
, O
but O
then O
the O
yoyo O
stopped O
, O
dangling O
at O
the O
end N
of O
the O
line N
. O

A O
great O
philosopher H
once O
said O
, O
muttered O
Quinn H
, O
that O
the O
way N
up O
and O
the O
way N
down O
are O
one N
and O
the O
same O
. O

But O
you H
didn't O
did O
n't O
make O
it O
go O
up O
, O
said O
the O
boy H
. O

It O
only O
went O
down O
. O

You H
have O
to O
keep O
trying O
. O

Quinn H
was O
rewinding O
the O
spool N
for O
another O
attempt N
when O
Auster O
and O
his O
wife H
entered O
the O
room N
. O

He O
looked O
up O
and O
saw O
the O
woman H
first O
. O

In O
that O
one N
brief N
moment N
he O
knew O
that O
he O
was O
in O
trouble N
. O

She O
was O
a O
tall O
, O
thin O
blonde O
, O
radiantly O
beautiful O
, O
with O
an O
energy N
and O
happiness N
that O
seemed O
to O
make O
everything O
around O
her O
invisible O
. O

It O
was O
too O
much O
for O
Quinn H
. O

He O
felt N
as O
though O
Auster O
were O
taunting O
him O
with O
the O
things N
he O
had O
lost O
, O
and O
he O
responded O
with O
envy O
and O
rage O
, O
a O
lacerating O
self-pity N
. O

Yes O
, O
he O
too O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
have O
this O
wife H
and O
this O
child H
, O
to O
sit O
around O
all O
day N
spouting O
drivel N
about O
old O
books N
, O
to O
be O
surrounded O
by O
yoyos O
and O
ham O
omelettes N
and O
fountain N
pens N
. O

He O
prayed O
to O
himself O
for O
deliverance N
. O

Auster O
saw O
the O
yoyo O
in O
his O
hands N
and O
said O
, O
I H
see O
you've O
you H
've O
already O
met O
. O

Daniel H
, O
he O
said O
to O
the O
boy H
, O
this O
is O
Daniel H
. O

And O
then O
to O
Quinn H
, O
with O
that O
same O
ironic O
smile O
, O
Daniel H
, O
this O
is O
Daniel H
. O

The O
boy H
burst O
out O
laughing O
and O
said O
, O
Everybody's O
Everybody O
's H
Daniel H
! O

That's O
That O
's H
right O
, O
said O
Quinn H
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
you H
, O
and O
you're O
you H
're O
me H
. O

And O
around O
and O
around O
it O
goes O
, O
shouted O
the O
boy H
, O
suddenly O
spreading O
his O
arms N
and O
spinning N
around O
the O
room N
like O
a O
gyroscope N
. O

And O
this O
, O
said O
Auster O
, O
turning O
to O
the O
woman H
, O
is O
my H
wife H
, O
Siri O
. O

The O
wife H
smiled O
her O
smile O
, O
said O
she O
was O
glad O
to O
meet O
Quinn H
as O
though O
she O
meant O
it O
, O
and O
then O
extended O
her O
hand N
to O
him O
. O

He O
shook O
it O
, O
feeling O
the O
uncanny O
slenderness N
of O
her O
bones N
, O
and O
asked O
if O
her O
name N
was O
Norwegian O
. O

Not O
many O
people N
know O
that O
, O
she O
said O
. O

Do O
you H
come O
from O
Norway O
? O

Indirectly O
, O
she O
said O
. O
By O
way N
of O
Northfield O
, O
Minnesota O
. O

And O
then O
she O
laughed O
her O
laugh O
, O
and O
Quinn H
felt N
a O
little O
more O
of O
himself O
collapse N
. O

Quinn H
was O
nowhere O
now O
. O

He O
had O
nothing N
, O
he O
knew O
nothing N
, O
he O
knew O
that O
he O
knew O
nothing N
. O

Not O
only O
had O
he O
been O
sent O
back O
to O
the O
beginning O
, O
he O
was O
now O
before O
the O
beginning O
, O
and O
so O
far O
before O
the O
beginning O
that O
it O
was O
worse O
than O
any O
end N
he O
could O
imagine O
. O

His O
watch O
read O
nearly O
six O
. O

Quinn H
walked O
home N
the O
way N
he O
had O
come O
, O
lengthening O
his O
strides N
with O
each O
new O
block O
. O

By O
the O
time N
he O
came O
to O
his O
street N
, O
he O
was O
running O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
June O
second N
, O
he O
told O
himself O
. O

Try O
to O
remember O
that O
. O

This O
is O
New O
York O
, O
and O
tomorrow N
will O
be O
June O
third O
. O

If O
all O
goes O
well O
, O
the O
following O
day N
will O
be O
the O
fourth O
. O

But O
nothing N
is O
certain O
. O

The O
hour N
had O
long O
since O
passed O
for O
his O
call O
to O
Virginia H
Stillman O
, O
and O
he O
debated O
whether O
to O
go O
through O
with O
it O
. O

Would O
it O
be O
possible O
to O
ignore O
her O
? O

Could O
he O
abandon N
everything O
now O
, O
just O
like O
that O
? O

Yes O
, O
he O
said O
to O
himself O
, O
it O
was O
possible O
. O

He O
could O
forget O
about O
the O
case N
, O
get O
back O
to O
his O
routine N
, O
write O
another O
book O
. O

He O
could O
take O
a O
trip N
if O
he O
liked O
, O
even O
leave O
the O
country N
for O
a O
while O
. O

He O
could O
go O
to O
Paris O
, O
for O
example N
. O

Yes O
, O
that O
was O
possible O
. O

But O
anywhere O
would O
do O
, O
he O
thought O
, O
anywhere O
at O
all O
. O

He O
sat O
down O
in O
his O
living O
room N
and O
looked O
at O
the O
walls N
. O

They O
had O
once O
been O
white O
, O
he O
remembered O
, O
but O
now O
they O
had O
turned O
a O
curious O
shade N
of O
yellow O
. O

Perhaps O
one N
day N
they O
would O
drift O
further O
into O
dinginess N
, O
lasping O
into O
gray O
, O
or O
even O
brown O
, O
like O
some O
pieces N
of O
aging N
fruit N
. O

A O
white O
wall N
becomes O
a O
yellow O
wall N
becomes O
a O
gray O
wall N
, O
he O
said O
to O
himself O
. O

The O
paint O
becomes O
exhausted O
, O
the O
city N
encroaches O
with O
its O
soot N
, O
the O
plaster N
crumbles O
within O
. O

Changes N
, O
then O
more O
changes N
still O
. O

He O
smoked O
a O
cigarette N
, O
and O
then O
another O
, O
and O
then O
another O
. O

He O
looked O
at O
his O
hands N
, O
saw O
that O
they O
were O
dirty O
, O
and O
got O
up O
to O
wash O
them O
. O

In O
the O
bathroom N
, O
with O
the O
water N
running O
in O
the O
sink N
, O
he O
decided O
to O
shave N
as O
well O
. O

He O
lathered O
his O
face N
, O
took O
out O
a O
clean O
blade N
, O
and O
started O
scraping O
off O
his O
beard N
. O

For O
some O
reason N
, O
he O
found O
it O
unpleasant O
to O
look O
in O
the O
mirror N
and O
kept O
trying O
to O
avoid O
himself O
with O
his O
eyes N
. O

You're O
You H
're O
getting O
old O
, O
he O
said O
to O
himself O
, O
you're O
you H
're O
turning O
into O
an O
old O
fart N
. O

Then O
he O
went O
into O
the O
kitchen N
, O
ate O
a O
bowl N
of O
cornflakes O
, O
and O
smoked O
another O
cigarette N
. O

It O
was O
seven O
o'clock O
now O
. O

Once O
again O
, O
he O
debated O
whether O
to O
call O
Virginia H
Stillman O
. O

As O
he O
turned O
the O
question N
over O
in O
his O
mind N
, O
it O
occurred O
to O
him O
that O
he O
no O
longer O
had O
an O
opinion N
. O

He O
saw O
the O
argument N
for O
making O
the O
call O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time N
he O
saw O
the O
argument N
for O
not O
making O
it O
. O

In O
the O
end N
, O
it O
was O
etiquette N
that O
decided O
. O

It O
would O
not O
be O
fair O
to O
disappear O
without O
telling O
her O
first O
. O

After O
that O
, O
it O
would O
be O
perfectly O
acceptable O
. O

As O
long O
as O
you H
tell O
people N
what O
you H
are O
going O
to O
do O
, O
he O
reasoned O
, O
it O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
matter N
. O

Then O
you H
are O
free O
to O
do O
what O
you H
want O
. O

The O
number N
, O
however O
, O
was O
busy O
. O

He O
waited O
five O
minutes N
and O
dialed O
again O
. O

Again O
, O
the O
number N
was O
busy O
. O

For O
the O
next O
hour N
Quinn H
alternated O
between O
dialing O
and O
waiting O
, O
always O
with O
the O
same O
result N
. O

At O
last O
he O
called O
the O
operator N
and O
asked O
whether O
the O
phone N
was O
out O
of O
order O
. O

There O
would O
be O
a O
charge O
of O
thirty O
cents N
, O
he O
was O
told O
. O

Then O
came O
a O
crackling N
in O
the O
wires N
, O
the O
sound N
of O
further O
dialing O
, O
more O
voices N
. O

Quinn H
tried O
to O
imagine O
what O
the O
operators H
looked O
like O
. O

Then O
the O
first O
woman H
spoke O
again O
: O
the O
number N
was O
busy O
. O

Quinn H
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
think O
. O

There O
were O
so O
many O
possibilities N
, O
he O
could O
not O
even O
begin O
. O

Stillman O
? O
The O
phone N
off O
the O
hook O
? O
Someone O
else O
altogether O
? O

He O
turned O
on O
the O
television N
and O
watched O
the O
first O
two O
innings N
of O
the O
Mets O
game N
. O

Then O
he O
dialed O
once O
again O
. O

Same O
thing N
. O

In O
the O
top N
of O
the O
third O
St. O
Louis O
scored O
on O
a O
walk O
, O
a O
stolen O
base N
, O
an O
infield N
out O
, O
and O
a O
sacrifice N
fly O
. O

The O
Mets O
matched O
that O
run O
in O
their O
half O
of O
the O
inning N
on O
a O
double O
by O
Wilson H
and O
a O
single O
by O
Youngblood O
. O

Quinn H
realized O
that O
he O
didn't O
did O
n't O
care N
. O

A O
beer N
commercial O
came O
on O
, O
and O
he O
turned O
off O
the O
sound N
. O

For O
the O
twentieth O
time N
the O
same O
thing N
happened O
. O

In O
the O
top N
of O
the O
fourth O
St. O
Louis O
scored O
five O
runs O
, O
and O
Quinn H
turned O
off O
the O
picture N
as O
well O
. O

He O
found O
his O
red O
notebook N
, O
sat O
down O
at O
his O
desk N
, O
and O
wrote O
steadily O
for O
the O
next O
two O
hours N
. O

He O
did O
not O
bother O
to O
read O
over O
what O
he O
had O
written O
. O

Then O
he O
called O
Virginia H
Stillman O
and O
got O
another O
busy O
signal N
. O

He O
slammed O
the O
receiver H
down O
so O
hard O
that O
the O
plastic N
cracked O
. O

When O
he O
tried O
to O
call O
again O
, O
he O
could O
no O
longer O
get O
a O
dial N
tone N
. O

He O
stood O
up O
, O
went O
into O
the O
kitchen N
, O
and O
made O
another O
bowl N
of O
cornflakes O
. O

Then O
he O
went O
to O
bed N
. O

In O
his O
dream O
, O
which O
he O
later O
forgot O
, O
he O
found O
himself O
walking O
down O
Broadway O
, O
holding O
Auster's O
Auster O
's H
son H
by O
the O
hand N
. O

Security N
measures N
are O
strict O
on O
flights N
to O
Israel O
, O
the O
bags N
are O
searched O
, O
the O
men H
are O
frisked O
, O
and O
the O
women H
have O
an O
electronic O
hoop N
passed O
over O
them O
, O
fore-and-aft O
. O

Then O
hand N
luggage N
is O
opened O
. O

No O
one N
is O
very O
patient H
. O

Visibility N
in O
the O
queue N
is O
poor O
because O
of O
the O
many O
Hasidim N
with O
their O
broad O
hats N
and O
beards N
and O
sidelocks O
and O
dangling O
fringes N
who O
have O
descended O
on O
Heathrow O
and O
are O
far O
too O
restless O
to O
wait N
in O
line N
but O
rush N
in O
and O
out O
, O
gesticulating O
, O
exclaiming O
. O

The O
corridors N
are O
jumping O
with O
them O
. O

Some O
two O
hundred O
Hasidim N
are O
flying O
to O
Israel O
to O
attend O
the O
circumcision N
of O
the O
firstborn O
son H
of O
their O
spiritual O
leader H
, O
the O
Belzer O
Rabbi H
. O

Entering O
the O
747 O
, O
my H
wife H
, O
Alexandra H
, O
and O
I H
are O
enfiladed O
by O
eyes N
that O
lie O
dark O
in O
hairy O
ambush N
. O

To O
me H
there O
is O
nothing N
foreign O
in O
these O
hats N
, O
side-locks O
, O
and O
fringes N
. O

It O
is O
my H
childhood N
revisited O
. O

At O
the O
age N
of O
six O
, O
I H
myself H
wore O
a O
tallith N
katan O
, O
or O
scapular N
, O
under O
my H
shirt N
, O
only O
mine H
was O
a O
scrap N
of O
green O
calico N
print N
, O
whereas O
theirs O
are O
white O
linen N
. O

God H
instructed O
Moses H
to O
speak O
to O
the O
children H
of O
Israel O
and O
to O
" O
bid N
them O
that O
they O
make O
them O
fringes N
in O
the O
borders N
of O
their O
garments N
. O
" O

So O
they O
are O
still O
wearing O
them O
some O
four O
thousand O
years N
later O
. O

We H
find O
our H
seats N
, O
two O
in O
a O
row N
of O
three O
, O
toward O
the O
rear O
of O
the O
aircraft N
. O

" O
Do O
you H
speak O
Yiddish N
? O
" O
he O
says O
. O

" O
Yes O
, O
certainly O
. O
" O

" O
I H
can O
not O
be O
next O
to O
your H
wife H
. O

Please O
sit O
between O
us H
. O

Be O
so O
good O
, O
" O
he O
says O
. O

" O
Of O
course N
. O
" O

I H
take O
the O
middle O
seat N
, O
which O
I H
dislike N
, O
but O
I H
am O
not O
really O
put O
out O
. O

Curious O
, O
rather O
. O

Our H
Hasid H
is O
in O
his O
late O
twenties N
. O

He O
is O
pimply O
, O
his O
neck N
is O
thin O
, O
his O
blue O
eyes N
goggle O
, O
his O
underlip N
extrudes O
. O

He O
does O
not O
keep O
a O
civilized O
face N
. O

Thoughts N
and O
impulses N
other O
than O
civilized O
fill O
it O
by O
no O
means N
inferior O
impulses N
and O
thoughts N
. O

And O
though O
he O
is O
not O
permitted O
to O
sit O
beside O
women H
unrelated O
to O
him O
or O
to O
look O
at O
them O
or O
to O
communicate O
with O
them O
in O
any O
manner N
( O
all O
of O
which O
probably O
saves O
him O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
trouble N
) O
, O
he O
seems O
a O
good-hearted O
young O
man H
and O
he O
is O
visibly O
enjoying O
himself O
. O

All O
the O
Hasidim N
are O
vividly O
enjoying O
themselves O
, O
dodging O
through O
the O
aisles N
, O
visiting O
chattering O
standing N
impatiently O
in O
the O
long O
lavatory N
lines N
, O
amiable O
, O
busy O
as O
geese A
. O

They O
pay O
no O
attention N
to O
signs N
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
they O
understand O
English O
? O

The O
stewardesses H
are O
furious O
with O
them O
. O

I H
ask O
one N
of O
the O
hostesses H
when O
I H
may O
expect O
to O
receive O
a O
drink N
and O
she O
cries O
out O
in O
irritation N
, O
" O
Back N
to O
your H
seat N
! O
" O

She O
says O
this O
in O
so O
ringing O
a O
voice H
that O
I H
retreat N
. O

Not O
so O
the O
merry-minded O
Hasidim N
, O
exulting O
everywhere O
. O

The O
orders N
given O
by O
these O
young O
gentile O
uniformed O
females H
are O
nothing N
to O
them O
. O

To O
them O
they O
are O
merely O
attendants H
, O
exotic O
bediener O
, O
all O
but O
bodyless O
. O

Anticipating O
a O
difficulty N
, O
I H
ask O
the O
stewardess H
to O
serve O
me H
a O
kosher O
lunch N
. O

" O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
do O
that O
, O
we H
haven't O
have O
n't O
enough O
for O
them O
, O
" O
she O
says O
. O

" O
We H
weren't O
were O
n't O
prepared O
. O
" O

Her O
big O
British O
eyes N
are O
affronted O
and O
her O
bosom N
has O
risen O
with O
indignation N
. O

" O
We've O
We H
've O
got O
to O
go O
out O
of O
our H
way N
to O
Rome O
for O
more O
of O
their O
special O
meals N
. O
" O

Amused O
, O
my H
wife H
asks O
why O
I H
ordered O
the O
kosher O
lunch N
. O

" O
Because O
when O
they O
bring O
my H
chicken N
dinner N
this O
kid H
with O
the O
beard N
will O
be O
in O
a O
state N
, O
" O
I H
explain O
. O

And O
so O
he O
is O
. O

The O
British O
Airways O
chicken N
with O
the O
chill O
of O
death N
upon O
it O
lies N
before O
me H
. O

But O
after O
three O
hours N
of O
security N
exercises N
at O
Heathrow O
I H
am O
hungry O
. O

The O
young O
Hasid H
recoils O
when O
the O
tray N
is O
handed O
to O
me H
. O

He O
addresses O
me H
again O
in O
Yiddish N
. O

He O
says O
, O
" O
I H
must O
talk O
to O
you H
. O

You H
won't O
wo O
n't O
be O
offended O
? O
" O

" O
No O
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O
" O

" O
You H
may O
want O
to O
give O
me H
a O
slap O
in O
the O
face N
. O
" O

" O
Why O
should O
I H
? O
" O

" O
You H
are O
a O
Jew H
. O

You H
must O
be O
a O
Jew H
, O
we H
are O
speaking O
Yiddish N
. O

How O
can O
you H
eat O
that O
! O
" O

" O
It O
looks O
awful O
, O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
it O
? O
" O

" O
You H
mustn't O
must O
n't O
touch O
it O
. O

My H
womenfolk O
packed O
kosher-beef O
sandwiches N
for O
me H
. O

Is O
your H
wife H
Jewish O
? O
" O

Here O
I'm O
I H
'm O
obliged O
to O
lie O
. O

Alexandra H
is O
Rumanian O
. O

But O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
give O
him O
too O
many O
shocks N
at O
once O
, O
and O
I H
say O
, O
" O
She O
has O
not O
had O
a O
Jewish O
upbringing N
. O
" O

" O
She O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
speak O
Yiddish N
? O
" O

" O
Not O
a O
word N
. O

But O
excuse O
me H
, O
I H
want O
my H
lunch N
. O
" O

" O
Will O
you H
eat O
some O

That's O

I H

In O

will O
you H
take O
my H
fifteen O

" O

" O
Kosher O
food N

more O
expensive O
than O

kinds N

" O
I H
say O
. O

" O
Fifteen O
dollars N
isn't O
is O
n't O
nearly O
enough O
. O
" O

" O
I H
can O
go O
as O
far O
as O
twenty-five O

" O

" O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
accept O
such O

" O

Shrugging O
, O
he O
gives O
up O

I H
turn O
to O
the O
twice O
disagreeable O
chicken N

eat O
guiltily O

my H
appetite N

The O
young O
Hasid H
opens O
his O
prayer N

" O
He's O
He O

so O
fervent O
, O
" O
says O
my H

I H
wonder O
if O
he's O
he O

She O
smiles O

As O
soon O
as O
the O

removed O

the O
Hasidim N
block O
the O
aisles N
with O
their O
Minchah O
service N
, O
rocking O
themselves O
and O
stretching O
their O
necks N
upward O
. O

This O
is O
what O
has O
held O
the O
Jews O
together O
for O
thousands N
of O
years N

" O
I H
like O
them O
, O
" O
says O
my H
wife H

" O
They're O
They O
're O
so O
lively O
, O
so O
childlike O

" O

" O
You H
might O
find O
them O
a O
little O
hard O

" O
I H
tell O
her O

" O
You'd O
You H
'd O
have O
to O
do O
everything O
their O
way N

no O
options N

" O

" O
But O
they're O
they O
're O
cheerful O

they're O
they O

warm O

natural O

I H
love O
their O
costumes N

Couldn't O
Could O

you H
get O
one N

those O
beautiful O
hats N

" O

" O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O

whether O
they O

them O
to O

" O

When O
the O
Hasid H
returns O
to O
his O
seat N
after O
prayers N

I H
tell O
him O
that O
my H

the O
Hebrew O

" O
What O

? O
" O

" O
A O
mathematician H

He O
is O
puzzled O

" O
What O
is O
that O
? O
" O
he O
asks O

He O
says O

" O
This O

What O
actually O

? O
" O

I H
am O
astonished O

I H
knew O
that O

I H
would O

On O
July O
12 O
, O
after O
the O
raid O
, O
Israel O
was O
accused O
of O
giving O
comfort O
to O
the O
reactionaries H
of O
Rhodesia O

South O
Africa O
by O
its O
demonstration N
of O
military O
superiority N

its O
use O

Third O
World N

Rhodesians O
and O
South O
Africans H
, O
said O
Le O

, O
were O
toasting O
the O
Israelis O
in O
champagne N

But O
European O
approval N
of O
the O
raid O
would O
endanger O
the O
plans N

France O
for O
a O
new O
international O
order O
. O

On O
July O
4-5 O
, O
again O
before O
the O
rescue N
, O
Le O
Monde O
had O
reported O
without O
comment O
wisecracks N
made O
by O
Amin O
in O
a O
speech N
at O
Port O
Louis O
. O

Addressing O
the O
OAS O
, O
Amin O
had O
provoked O
laughter N
and O
applause N
among O
the O
delegates H
by O
saying O
that O
the O
hostages H
were O
as O
comfortable O
as O
they O
could O
be O
in O
the O
circumstances N
surrounded O
by O
explosives N

" O
When O
I H
left O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
laughing O
, O
" O
the O
hostages H
wept O
and O
begged O
me H
to O
stay O
. O
" O

This O
broke O
everybody O
up O
. O

We H
step O
into O
the O
street N
and O
my H
friend H
David H
Shahar O
, O
whose O
chest N
is O
large O
, O
takes O
a O
deep O
breath N
and O
advises O
me H
to O
do O
the O
same O
. O

The O
air N
, O
the O
very O
air N
, O
is O
thought-nourishing O
in O
Jerusalem O
, O
the O
Sages H
themselves O
said O
so O
. O

I H
am O
prepared O
to O
believe O
it O
. O

I H
know O
that O
it O
must O
have O
special O
properties N
. O

The O
delicacy N
of O
the O
light N
also O
affects O
me H
. O

I H
look O
downward O
toward O
the O
Dead O
Sea N
, O
over O
broken O
rocks N
and O
small O
houses N
with O
bulbous O
roofs N
. O

The O
color N
of O
these O
is O
that O
of O
the O
ground N
itself O
, O
and O
on O
this O
strange O
deadness N
the O
melting N
air N
presses O
with O
an O
almost O
human O
weight N
. O

Something O
intelligible O
, O
something O
metaphysical O
is O
communicated O
by O
these O
colors N
. O

The O
universe N
interprets O
itself O
before O
your H
eyes N
in O
the O
openness N
of O
the O
rockjumbled O
valley N
ending O
in O
dead O
water N
. O

Elsewhere O
you H
die O
and O
disintegrate O
. O

Here O
you H
die O
and O
mingle O
. O

Shahar O
leads O
me H
down O
from O
the O
Mishkenot O
Sha'ananim O
, O
which O
stands O
on O
a O
slope N
and O
faces N
Mount O
Zion O
and O
the O
Old O
City N
, O
to O
the O
Gai-Hinnom O
( O
Gehenna O
of O
tradition N
) O
, O
where O
worshipers H
of O
Moloch O
once O
sacrificed O
their O
children H
. O

He O
leads O
me H
from O
the O
Gai-Hinnom O
up O
to O
an O
ancient O
Karaite O
burial N
ground N
, O
where O
you H
can O
see O
the O
mingling N
for O
yourself H
. O

It O
acts N
queerly O
on O
my H
nerves N
( O
through O
the O
feet N
, O
as O
it O
were O
) O
, O
because O
I H
feel O
that O
a O
good O
part N
of O
this O
dust N
must O
be O
ground N
out O
of O
human O
bone N
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
that O
Jerusalem O
is O
geologically O
older O
than O
other O
places N
but O
the O
dolomite N
and O
clay O
look O
hoarier O
than O
anything O
I H
ever O
saw O
. O

Gray O
and O
sunken O
, O
in O
the O
thoughts N
of O
Mr N
Bloom H
in O
Joyce's O
Joyce H
's H
Ulysses O
. O

But O
there O
is O
nothing N
in O
the O
brilliant O
air N
and O
the O
massive O
white O
clouds N
hanging O
over O
the O
crumpled O
mountains N
that O
suggests O
exhaustion N
. O

This O
atmosphere N
makes O
the O
American O
commonplace O
" O
out O
of O
this O
world N
" O
true O
enough O
to O
give O
your H
soul N
a O
start O
. O

The O
municipality N
has O
turned O
the O
Gai-Hinnom O
into O
a O
park N
. O

The O
Wolfson O
Foundation N
of O
London O

paid O
for O

we H
look O
into O

You H
can O
be O
absolutely O
sure O
, O
says O
Shahar O
, O
that O
the O
Prophet O

passed O
this O
way N

In O
the O
Middle O

probably O
elsewhere O
, O
the O
United O

The O

a O
member N

a O
group N
called O
the O
Middle O
East O
Policy N

Committee N
, O
the O
main O
purpose N
of O
which O
was O
, O
in O
his O
own O
words N
, O
" O
to O
work N
out O
ways N

the O

despite O
all O
their O
power N

Frustrated O
, O
the O
Americans O
decided O
for O
the O
best O
of O
reasons N
, O
as O
always O
, O
to O
make O
a O
heavier O
move O
: O

" O
The O
American O
Minister H
at O

decided O
to O
encourage O
a O
military O
coup-d'etat O
, O
so O
that O
Syria O
might O
enjoy O
democracy N
, O
" O
Kedourie O
writes O
. O

This O
was O
not O
considered O
particularly O
bizarre O
; O
other O
American O
ambassadors H

ministers H
in O
the O
Arab O
world N

entirely O
in O
favor N

overthrow N
old O
landowners H

rich O
crooks H
, O

" O
What O
was O
wanted O

an O
elite O
to O

rulers H

themselves O
in O
turn O
supported O

buttressed O
by O
a O
population N

presumably O
understood O

approved O

legitimated O
the O
aims O

such O
an O
elite O

Whoever O
knows O

Middle O

agree O
that O
such O

quest N

equivalent N

It O
was O
Jefferson H

said O
that O
the O
tree A
of O
liberty N
must O
occasionally O
be O
refreshed O
with O
the O
blood N

We H
must O
now O
believe O
that O
the O

romantic O
conviction N

been O
alive O
somewhere O
in O
the O
offices N

J H
Walter H
Thompson H

The O
United O
States O
is O
, O
after O
all O
, O
the O
prime O
revolutionary O
country N

Or O
was O
Mr N
Eichelberger O
simply O
an O
executive O
with O
a O
client H
to O
please O
and O
a O
job N
to O
do O
a O
pure O
professional O
? O

Or O
is O
there O
in O

a O

understanding N

of O

This O
is O
a O
shocking O
suspicion N

Of O
course N
the O
paper N
written O
by O
Mr N
Eichelberger O
and O
his O
Egyptian O
collaborators H
states N
that O
the O
purpose N
of O
the O
Nasser O
seizure N
of O
power N
was O
" O
to O
solve O
the O
pressing O
social O

problems N

made O
the O
revolution N

. O
" O

America's O
America O

position N

at O
the O

time N
to O
do O
good O
; O

to O
advance N
the O
cause N
of O
universal O
equality N
; O

to O
be O
the O
illusionless O
tough O
guy H
on O
a O
world N
scale N
; O

to O
be O
a O
mover H

shaker H

a O
shaper H

perhaps O
, O
surrendering O
to O

American O
plenipotentiary H

at O

confidently O
even O
with O

fire N

And O
what O
problems N

? O

Nasser O
solved O
no O
problems N

Mr N
Kedourie O
doubts N
that O
he O
needed O
" O
to O
call O
on O
the O
resources N
of O
American O
political O
science N
for O
such O
lessons N
in O
tyranny N
? O

What O
does O
remain O
most O
puzzling O
, O
" O
he O
says O
, O
" O
is O
why O
it O
was O
thought O
that O
the O
imparting O
of O
such O
lessons N
could O
advance N
the O
interests N

the O
United O

, O
or O
even O
contribute O
to O
the O
welfare N
of O
the O
Egyptian O
people N
. O
" O

For O
an O
American O
, O
the O
most O
intriguing O
question N
is O
this O
: O

Whence O
the O
passion N
for O
social O
theory N
among O
these O
high O
functionaries H
of O
the O
advertising N
world N
? O

How O
did O
executive O
types N
ever O
learn O
of O
such O
things N
? O

Reading O
The O
Sound O
and O
the O
Fury N
last O
night N
, O
I H
came O
upon O
words N
in O
Compson's O
Compson O
's H
thought O
that O
belonged O
to O
E H
E H
Cummings H
and O
the O
thirties N
, O
not O
to O
the O
year N
1910 O
. O

" O
Land N
of O
the O
kike H
home N
of O
the O
wop H
, O
" O
says O
Compson O
to O
himself O
when O
he O
buys O
a O
bun N
from O
a O
small O
Italian O
girl H
. O

This O
I H
would O
have O
read O
without O
flinching O
in O
Chicago O
but O
in O
Jerusalem O
I H
flinched O
and O
put O
the O
book O
down O
. O

Returning O
to O
it O
next O
day N
, O
I H
found O
Faulkner O
guilty O
of O
no O
offense N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
possible O
that O
people N
at O
the O
turn O
of O
the O
century N
were O
saying O
" O
land O
of O
the O
kike H
" O
and O
that O
Faulkner O
didn't O
did O
n't O
borrow O
it O
from O
Cummings H
. O

I H
had O
been O
telling O
Shahar O
when O
we H
were O
walking O
in O
the O
Gai-Hinnom O
that O
I H
hadn't O
had O
n't O
liked O
it O
when O
David H
Ben-Gurion O
on O
his O
visits N
to O
the O
United O
States O
would O
call O
upon O
American O
Jews O
to O
give O
up O
their O
illusions N
about O
goyish O
democracy N
and O
emigrate O
full O
speed N
to O
Israel O
. O

As O
if O
America's O
America O
's H
two-hundred-year O
record N
of O
liberal O
democracy N
signified O
nothing N
. O

If O
Israel O
were O
governed O
as O
Egypt O
is O
, O
or O
Syria O
, O
would O
I H
have O
come O
here O
at O
all O
? O

But O
then O
, O
to O
its O
more O
severe O
leftist H
critics H
, O
some O
of O
them O
Jews O
, O
Israel O
is O
not O
the O
" O
democratic O
exception N
" O
it O
is O
said O
to O
be O
. O

The O
New O
Left O
sees O
it O
as O
a O
reactionary O
small O
country N
. O

Its O
detractors H
tell O
you H
how O
it O
abuses N
its O
Arab O
population N
and O
, O
to O
a O
lesser O
extent N
, O
Jewish O
immigrants H
from O
North O
Africa O
and O
the O
Orient O
. O

It O
is O
occasionally O
denounced O
by O
some O
Israelis O
as O
corrupt O
, O
" O
Levantine O
, O
" O
theocratic O
. O

Gossip N
traces N
the O
worst O
of O
the O
Israeli O
financial O
swindles N
to O
the O
most O
observant O
of O
Orthodox O
Jews O
. O

I H
am O
often O
told O
that O
the O
old O
Ashkenazi O
leaders H
were O
unimaginative O
, O
that O
the O
new O
Rabin O
group N
lacks O
stature N
, O
that O
Ben-Gurion O
was O
a O
terrible O
old O
guy H
but O
a O
true O
leader H
, O
that O
the O
younger O
generation N
is O
hostile O
to O
North O
African O
and O
Asian O
Jews O
. O

These O
North O
African O
and O
Oriental O
immigrants H
are O
blamed O
for O
bringing O
a O
baksheesh N
mentality N
to O
Israel O
; O
the O
intellectuals H
are O
blamed O
for O
letting O
the O
quality N
of O
life N
( O
a O
deplorable O
phrase N
) O
deteriorate O
. O

" O
We H
came O
here O
to O
build O
a O
just O
society N
. O

And O
what O
happened O
immediately O
? O
" O

I H
speak O
of O
this O
to O
Shahar O
. O

He O
says O
to O
me H
, O
" O
Where O
there O
is O
no O
paradox N
there O
is O
no O
life N
. O
" O

In O
Jakov O
Lind's O
Lind O
's H
interesting O
brief N
book O
on O
Israel O
, O
Ben-Gurion O
is O
quoted O
as O
saying O
, O
" O
The O
Jews O
know O
hardly O
anything O
of O
a O
hell N
that O
might O
await O
them O
. O

Their O
hell N
is O
a O
personal O
dissatisfaction N
with O
themselves O
if O
they O
are O
mediocre O
. O
" O

Jews O
do O
, O
it O
is O
well O
known O
, O
make O
inordinate O
demands O
upon O
themselves O
and O
upon O
one N
another O
. O

Upon O
the O
world N
, O
too O
. O

I H
occasionally O
wonder O
whether O
that O
is O
why O
the O
world N
is O
so O
uncomfortable O
with O
them O
. O

At O
times N
I H
suspect O
that O
the O
world N
would O
be O
glad O
to O
see O
the O
last O
of O
its O
Christianity O
, O
and O
that O
it O
is O
the O
persistency N
of O
the O
Jews O
that O
prevents O
it O
. O

I H
say O
this O
remembering O
that O
Jacques H
Maritain O
once O
characterized O
European O
anti-Semitism N
of O
the O
twentieth O
century N
as O
an O
attempt N
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
moral O
burden N
of O
Christianity O
. O

And O
what O
is O
it O
that O
has O
led O
the O
Jews O
to O
place N
themselves O
, O
after O
the O
greatest O
disaster N
of O
their O
history N
, O
in O
a O
danger N
zone N
? O

" O
Wouldn't O
Would O
n't O
it O
be O
the O
most O
horrible O
of O
ironies N
if O
the O
Jews O
had O
collected O
themselves O
conveniently O
in O
one N
country N
for O
a O
second N
Holocaust O
? O
" O

This O
is O
a O
thought O
that O
sometimes O
crosses O
Jewish O
minds N
. O

It O
is O
accompanied O
by O
the O
further O
reflection N
( O
partly O
proud O
, O
mostly O
bitter O
) O
that O
we H
Jews O
seem O
to O
have O
a O
genius N
for O
finding O
the O
heart N
of O
the O
crisis N

doesn't O
does O
n't O
like O
the O
new O
huge O
tankers N
. O

Supermechanized O
, O
ultraefficient O
, O
they O
give O
the O
crew N
no O
time N
in O
foreign O
ports N
. O

The O
cargo N
on O
the O
voyage N
from O
which O
he O
has O
just O
returned O
was O
Dead O
Sea N
potash N
. O

They O
were O
to O
bring O
home N
Italian O
steel N
. O

North O
of O
Naples O
they O
had O
bad O
weather N
and O
engine N
trouble N
, O
but O
they O
reached O
their O
harbor N
and O
anchored O
near O
two O
Japanese O
ships N
. O

On O
the O
pilot's O
pilot O
's H
advice N
they O
were O
moved O
farther O
into O
port N
by O
two O
tugs N
. O

Within O
five O
hours N
John H
had O
repaired O
the O
engines N
, O
but O
the O
port N
officials O
claimed O
that O
the O
ship N
was O
incapacitated O
and O
demanded O
that O
the O
captain H
post N
a O
twenty-thousand-dollar O
bond N
against O
expenses N
that O
might O
be O
run O
up O
by O
his O
" O
crippled O
ship N
. O
" O

True O
, O
the O
ship N
had O
had O
to O
be O
moved O
into O
its O
berth N
by O
the O
tugs N
but O
it O
had O
been O
crippled O
only O
briefly O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
matter N
was O
in O
dispute N
. O

The O
ship N
lay O
unloaded O
and O
demurrage N
fees N
mounted O
in O
brief N
, O
a O
holdup N
by O
local O
racketeers H
. O

The O
same O
everywhere O
, O
now O
. O

Everybody O
has O
some O
con N
going O
, O
says O
John H
, O
who O
loves O
American O
slang N
. O

The O
home N
office N
in O
Haifa O
was O
trying O
to O
get O
protection N
from O
the O
insurance N
company N
. O

There O
were O
long O
days N
in O
port N
with O
nothing N
to O
do O
. O

The O
town N
was O
covered O
in O
potash N
dust N
. O

Waiters H
and O
bartenders H
wiped O
dishes N
and O
glasses N
continually O
. O

Brushing O
at O
dust N
was O
the O
commonest O
gesture N
in O
town N
. O

A O
community N
of O
about O
twenty O
thousand O
people N
had O
traffic N
jams N
worthy O
of O
Rome O
, O
cars N
as O
a O
matter N
of O
course N
rushing O
into O
the O
reserved O
bus N
lanes N
, O
screwing O
everything O
up O
and O
honking O
madly O
. O

It O
all O
came O
to O
a O
panting O
standstill N
morning N
and O
evening N
without O
fail O
. O

To O
get O
away O
from O
the O
traffic N
snarl N
you H
could O
climb O
a O
nearby O
mountain N
and O
come O
down O
to O
a O
deserted O
beach N
, O
similar O
to O
the O
beach N
at O
Sdot O
Yam O
. O

John H
and O
his O
dog A
, O
Mississippi O
, O
went O
there O
every O
day N
. O

The O
German O
tourists H
had O
gone O
home N
, O
the O
bathing N
cabins N
were O
nailed O
shut O
. O

It O
was O
lovely O
, O
the O
small O
waves N
coming O
in O
steadily O
. O

In O
little O
pangs N
, O
said O
John H
. O

Part N
of O
the O
American O
Sixth O
Fleet O
was O
anchored O
nearby O
. O

The O
aircraft N
carrier N
John H
F O
Kennedy H
, O
with O
its O
helicopters N
, O
reminded O
John H
of O
the O
death N
of O
his O
son H
. O

On O
shore N
leave O
they O
wear O
civilian O
clothing N
now O
. O

This O
probably O
makes O
them O
less O
rowdy O
. O

One O
of O
the O
boys H
was O
from O
Oklahoma O
, O
near O
Tulsa O
. O

He O
had O
heard O
of O
Israel O
, O
but O
only O
just O
, O
and O
he O
was O
not O
especially O
interested O
. O

John H
was O
delighted O
by O
this O
. O

A O
clean O
young O
soul N
, O
he O
said O
. O

Such O
ignorance N
was O
refreshing O
. O

The O
young O
sailor H
knew O
nothing N
about O
holocausts N
or O
tanks N
in O
the O
desert N
or O
terrorist H
bombs N
. O

Back N
at O
sea N
, O
John H
had O
to O
stand O
double O
watches N
in O
the O
engine N
room N
because O
he O
was O
shorthanded O
. O

Off O
duty N
, O
he O
read O
in O
his O
cabin N
and O
chatted O
with O
his O
confidante H
, O
Mississippi O
. O

The O
crew N
said O
he O
was O
drinking O
himself O
silly O
in O
his O
quarters N
. O

When O
the O
ship N
passed O
Stromboli O
at O
night N
, O
there O
was O
a O
streak N
of O
crimson O
lava N
flowing O
from O
the O
volcano N
and O
the O
sailors H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
leave O
the O
television N
set O
to O
look O
at O
this O
natural O
phenomenon N
. O

But O
an O
owl A
from O
the O
island N
, O
disturbed O
by O
the O
sparks N
, O
flew O
out O
to O
the O
ship N
and O
was O
discovered O
next O
day N
on O
the O
mast N
. O

One O
of O
the O
young O
sailors H
carried O
it O
down O
. O

Then O
an O
engine N
man H
from O
the O
Balkans O
said O
, O
" O
In O
our H
village N
we H
nailed O
owls A
to O
the O
church N
door N
when O
we H
caught O
them O
. O
" O

They O
shut O
the O
owl A
in O
the O
paint O
locker N
while O
they O
debated O
what O
to O
do O
with O
it O
, O
and O
in O
the O
night N
John H
set O
it O
free O
. O

The O
bird A
scratched O
his O
arm N
rather O
badly O
. O

" O
Go O
back O
to O
Stromboli O
, O
you H
dumb O
bastard H
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

So O
it O
flew O
off O
and O
the O
ship N
continued O
on O
its O
foul N
way N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
the O
water N
pumped O
into O
the O
tanks N
for O
ballast N
and O
then O
pumped O
out O
again O
that O
pollutes O
the O
seas N
, O
says O
John H
. O

Before O
I H
left O
Chicago O
, O
the O
art N
critic H
Harold H
Rosenberg H
said O
to O
me H
, O
" O
Going O
to O
Jerusalem O
? O

And O
wondering O
whether O
people N
will O
talk O
freely O
? O

You've O
You H
've O
got O
to O
be O
kidding O
, O
they'll O
they O
'll O
talk O
your H
head N
off O
. O
" O

He O
spoke O
as O
a O
Jew H
to O
a O
Jew H
about O
Jewish O
powers N
of O
speech N
. O

In O
flight N
, O
if O
the O
door N
of O
your H
plane N
comes O
open O
you H
are O
sucked O
into O
space N
. O

Here O
in O
Jerusalem O
, O
when O
you H
shut O
your H
apartment N
door N
behind O
you H
you H
fall N
into O
a O
gale N
of O
conversation N
exposition N
, O
argument N
, O
harangue N
, O
analysis N
, O
theory N
, O
expostulation N
, O
threat N
, O
and O
prophecy N
. O

From O
diplomats H
you H
hear O
cagey O
explanations N
; O

from O
responsible O
persons H
, O
cautious O
and O
grudging O
statements N
rephrasing O
and O
amending O
your H
own O
questions N
; O

from O
parents H
and O
children H
, O
deadly O
divisions N
; O

from O
friends H
who O
let O
themselves O
go O
, O
passionate O
speeches N
, O
raging O
denunciation N
of O
Western O
Europe O
, O
of O
Russia O
, O
of O
America O
. O

I H
listen O
carefully O
, O
closely O
, O
more O
closely O
than O
I've O
I H
've O
ever O
listened O
in O
my H
life N
, O
utterly O
attentive O
, O
but O
I H
often O
feel O
that O
I H
have O
dropped O
into O
a O
shoreless O
sea N
. O

The O
subject O
of O
all O
this O
talk O
is O
, O
ultimately O
, O
survival N
the O
survival N
of O
the O
decent O
society N
created O
in O
Israel O
within O
a O
few O
decades N
. O

At O
first O
this O
is O
hard O
to O
grasp O
because O
the O
setting N
is O
so O
civilized O
. O

You H
are O
in O
a O
city N
like O
many O
another O
well O
, O
not O
quite O
, O
for O
Jerusalem O
is O
the O
only O
ancient O
city N
I've O
I H
've O
ever O
seen O
whose O
antiquities N
are O
not O
on O
display O
as O
relics N
but O
are O
in O
daily O
use O
. O

Still O
, O
the O
city N
is O
a O
modern O
city N
with O
modern O
utilities N
. O

You H
shop N
in O
supermarkets N
, O
you H
say O
good O
morning N
to O
friends H
on O
the O
telephone N
, O
you H
hear O
symphony N
orchestras N
on O
the O
radio N
. O

But O
suddenly O
the O
music N
stops N
and O
a O
terrorist H
bomb N
is O
reported O
. O

A O
new O
explosion N
outside O
a O
coffee N
shop N
on O
the O
Jaffa O
Road O
: O
six O
young O
people N
killed O
and O
thirty-eight O
more O
wounded O
. O

Uneasy O
, O
you H
go O
out O
to O
your H
civilized O
dinner N
. O

Bombs N
are O
exploding O
everywhere O
. O

Dynamite N
has O
just O
been O
thrown O
in O
London O
; O

the O
difference N
is O
that O
when O
a O
bomb N
goes O
off O
in O
a O
West O
End N
restaurant N
the O
fundamental O
right O
of O
England O
to O
exist O
is O
not O
in O
dispute N
. O

Yet O
here O
you H
sit O
at O
dinner N
with O
charming O
people N
in O
a O
dining N
room N
like O
any O
other O
. O

You H
know O
that O
your H
hostess H
has O
lost O
a O
son H
; O
that O
her O
sister H
lost O
children H
in O
the O
1973 O
war N
; O

That O
in O
this O
Jerusalem O
street N
, O
coolly O
sweet O
with O
night N
flowers A
and O
dark O
green O
under O
the O
lamps N
, O
many O
other O
families N
have O
lost O
children H
. O

And O
on O
the O
Jaffa O
Road O
, O
because O
of O
another O
bomb N
, O
six O
adolescents H
two O
on O
a O
break O
from O
night N
school N
stopping O
at O
a O
coffee N
shop N
to O
eat O
buns N
, O
have O
just O
died O
. O

But O
in O
the O
domestic O
ceremony N
of O
passed O
dishes N
and O
filled O
glasses N
thoughts N
of O
a O
destructive O
enemy N
are O
hard O
to O
grasp O
. O

What O
you H
do O
know O
is O
that O
there O
is O
one N
fact N
of O
Jewish O
life N
unchanged O
by O
the O
creation N
of O
a O
Jewish O
state N
: O
you H
can O
not O
take O
your H
right O
to O
live O
for O
granted O
. O

Others O
can O
; O
you H
can O
not O
. O

This O
is O
not O
to O
say O
that O
everyone O
else O
is O
living O
pleasantly O
and O
well O
under O
a O
decent O
regime N
. O

No O
, O
it O
means N
only O
that O
the O
Jews O
, O
because O
they O
are O
Jews O
, O
have O
never O
been O
able O
to O
take O
the O
right O
to O
live O
as O
a O
natural O
right O
. O

To O
be O
sure O
, O
many O
Israelis O
refuse O
to O
admit O
that O
this O
historic O
uneasiness N
has O
not O
been O
eliminated O
. O

They O
seem O
to O
think O
of O
themselves O
as O
a O
fixed O
power N
, O
immovable O
. O

Their O
point N
has O
been O
made O
. O

The O
Nellie O
, O
a O
cruising O
yawl N
, O
swung O
to O
her O
anchor H
without O
a O
flutter N
of O
the O
sails N
, O
and O
was O
at O
rest N
. O

The O
flood N
had O
made O
, O
the O
wind N
was O
nearly O
calm O
, O
and O
being O
bound O
down O
the O
river N
, O
the O
only O
thing N
for O
it O
was O
to O
come O
to O
and O
wait N
for O
the O
turn O
of O
the O
tide N
. O

The O
sea-reach O
of O
the O
Thames O
stretched O
before O
us H
like O
the O
beginning O
of O
an O
interminable O
waterway N
. O

In O
the O
offing N
the O
sea N
and O
the O
sky O
were O
welded O
together O
without O
a O
joint O
, O
and O
in O
the O
luminous O
space N
the O
tanned O
sails N
of O
the O
barges N
drifting O
up O
with O
the O
tide N
seemed O
to O
stand O
still O
in O
red O
clusters N
of O
canvas N
sharply O
peaked O
, O
with O
gleams N
of O
varnished O
sprits N
. O

A O
haze N
rested O
on O
the O
low O
shores N
that O
ran O
out O
to O
sea N
in O
vanishing O
flatness N
. O

The O
air N
was O
dark O
above O
Gravesend O
, O
and O
farther O
back O
still O
seemed O
condensed O
into O
a O
mournful O
gloom N
, O
brooding O
motionless O
over O
the O
biggest O
, O
and O
the O
greatest O
, O
town N
on O
earth N
. O

The O
Director O
of O
Companies N
was O
our H
captain H
and O
our H
host H
. O

We H
four O
affectionately O
watched O
his O
back O
as O
he O
stood O
in O
the O
bows N
looking O
to O
seaward O
. O

On O
the O
whole O
river N
there O
was O
nothing N
that O
looked O
half O
so O
nautical O
. O

He O
resembled O
a O
pilot O
, O
which O
to O
a O
seaman H
is O
trustworthiness N
personified O
. O

It O
was O
difficult O
to O
realize O
his O
work N
was O
not O
out O
there O
in O
the O
luminous O
estuary N
, O
but O
behind O
him O
, O
within O
the O
brooding O
gloom N
. O

Between O
us H
there O
was O
, O
as O
I H
have O
already O
said O
somewhere O
, O
the O
bond N
of O
the O
sea N
. O

Besides O
holding O
our H
hearts N
together O
through O
long O
periods N
of O
separation N
, O
it O
had O
the O
effect N
of O
making O
us H
tolerant O
of O
each O
other's O
other O
's H
yarns N
– O
and O
even O
convictions N
. O

The O
Lawyer H
– O
the O
best O
of O
old O
fellows H
– O
had O
, O
because O
of O
his O
many O
years N
and O
many O
virtues N
, O
the O
only O
cushion N
on O
deck N
, O
and O
was O
lying O
on O
the O
only O
rug N
. O

The O
Accountant H
had O
brought O
out O
already O
a O
box N
of O
dominoes H
, O
and O
was O
toying O
architecturally O
with O
the O
bones N
. O

Marlow O
sat O
cross-legged O
right O
aft O
, O
leaning O
against O
the O
mizzen-mast O
. O

He O
had O
sunken O
cheeks N
, O
a O
yellow O
complexion N
, O
a O
straight O
back O
, O
an O
ascetic O
aspect N
, O
and O
, O
with O
his O
arms N
dropped O
, O
the O
palms N
of O
hands N
outwards O
, O
resembled O
an O
idol N
. O

The O
Director O
, O
satisfied O
the O
anchor H
had O
good O
hold O
, O
made O
his O
way N
aft O
and O
sat O
down O
amongst O
us H
. O

We H
exchanged O
a O
few O
words N
lazily O
. O

Afterwards O
there O
was O
silence N
on O
board N
the O
yacht N
. O

For O
some O
reason N
or O
other O
we H
did O
not O
begin O
that O
game N
of O
dominoes H
. O

We H
felt N
meditative O
, O
and O
fit O
for O
nothing N
but O
placid O
staring O
. O

The O
day N
was O
ending O
in O
a O
serenity N
of O
still O
and O
exquisite O
brilliance N
. O

The O
water N
shone O
pacifically O
; O
the O
sky O
, O
without O
a O
speck N
, O
was O
a O
benign O
immensity N
of O
unstained O
light N
; O
the O
very O
mist N
on O
the O
Essex O
marshes N
was O
like O
a O
gauzy O
and O
radiant O
fabric N
, O
hung O
from O
the O
wooded O
rises O
inland O
, O
and O
draping O
the O
low O
shores N
in O
diaphanous O
folds N
. O

Only O
the O
gloom N
to O
the O
west O
, O
brooding O
over O
the O
upper O
reaches O
, O
became O
more O
somber O
every O
minute O
, O
as O
if O
angered O
by O
the O
approach N
of O
the O
sun N
. O

And O
at O
last O
, O
in O
its O
curved O
and O
imperceptible O
fall N
, O
the O
sun N
sank O
low O
, O
and O
from O
glowing O
white O
changed O
to O
a O
dull O
red O
without O
rays N
and O
without O
heat N
, O
as O
if O
about O
to O
go O
out O
suddenly O
, O
stricken O
to O
death N
by O
the O
touch O
of O
that O
gloom N
brooding O
over O
a O
crowd N
of O
men H
. O

Forthwith O
a O
change O
came O
over O
the O
waters N
, O
and O
the O
serenity N
became O
less O
brilliant O
but O
more O
profound O
. O

The O
old O
river N
in O
its O
broad O
reach O
rested O
unruffled O
at O
the O
decline N
of O
day N
, O
after O
ages N
of O
good O
service N
done O
to O
the O
race N
that O
peopled O
its O
banks N
, O
spread O
out O
in O
the O
tranquil O
dignity N
of O
a O
waterway N
leading N
to O
the O
uttermost O
ends O
of O
the O
earth N
. O

We H
looked O
at O
the O
venerable O
stream O
not O
in O
the O
vivid O
flush O
of O
a O
short O
day N
that O
comes O
and O
departs O
for O
ever O
, O
but O
in O
the O
august O
light N
of O
abiding O
memories N
. O

And O
indeed O
nothing N
is O
easier O
for O
a O
man H
who O
has O
, O
as O
the O
phrase N
goes O
, O
followed O
the O
sea N
with O
reverence N
and O
affection N
, O
than O
to O
evoke O
the O
great O
spirit N
of O
the O
past N
upon O
the O
lower O
reaches O
of O
the O
Thames O
. O

The O
tidal O
current O
runs O
to O
and O
fro O
in O
its O
unceasing O
service N
, O
crowded O
with O
memories N
of O
men H
and O
ships N
it O
had O
borne O
to O
the O
rest N
of O
home N
or O
to O
the O
battles N
of O
the O
sea N
. O

It O
had O
known O
and O
served O
all O
the O
men H
of O
whom O
the O
nation N
is O
proud O
, O
from O
Sir O
Francis H
Drake H
to O
Sir O
John H
Franklin H
, O
knights O
all O
, O
titled O
and O
untitled O
– O
the O
great O
knights-errant O
of O
the O
sea N
. O

It O
had O
borne O
all O
the O
ships N
whose O
names N
are O
like O
jewels N
flashing O
in O
the O
night N
of O
time N
, O
from O
the O
Golden O
Hind O
returning O
with O
her O
round O
flanks N
full O
of O
treasure N
, O
to O
be O
visited O
by O
the O
Queen's O
Queen O
's H
Highness H
and O
thus O
pass O
out O
of O
the O
gigantic O
tale N
, O
to O
the O
Erebus O
and O
Terror O
, O
bound O
on O
other O
conquests N
– O
and O
that O
never O
returned O
. O

It O
had O
known O
the O
ships N
and O
the O
men H
. O

They O
had O
sailed O
from O
Deptford O
, O
from O
Greenwich O
, O
from O
Erith O
– O
the O
adventurers H
and O
the O
settlers H
; O
kings H
' O
ships N
and O
the O
ships N
of O
men H
on O
Change N
; O
captains H
, O
admirals H
, O
the O
dark O
" O
interlopers H
" O
of O
the O
Eastern O
trade N
, O
and O
the O
commissioned O
" O
generals H
" O
of O
East O
India O
fleets N
. O

Hunters H
for O
gold N
or O
pursuers H
of O
fame N
, O
they O
all O
had O
gone O
out O
on O
that O
stream O
, O
bearing O
the O
sword N
, O
and O
often O
the O
torch N
, O
messengers H
of O
the O
might O
within O
the O
land O
, O
bearers H
of O
a O
spark N
from O
the O
sacred O
fire N
. O

What O
greatness N
had O
not O
floated O
on O
the O
ebb N
of O
that O
river N
into O
the O
mystery N
of O
an O
unknown O
earth N
! O
... O

The O
dreams N
of O
men H
, O
the O
seed N
of O
commonwealths N
, O
the O
germs N
of O
empires N
. O

The O
sun N
set O
; O
the O
dusk N
fell O
on O
the O
stream O
, O
and O
lights N
began O
to O
appear O
along O
the O
shore N
. O

The O
Chapman O
lighthouse N
, O
a O
three-legged O
thing N
erect O
on O
a O
mud-flat O
, O
shone O
strongly O
. O

Lights O
of O
ships N
moved O
in O
the O
fairway N
– O
a O
great O
stir O
of O
lights N
going O
up O
and O
going O
down O
. O
And O
farther O
west O
on O
the O
upper O
reaches O
the O
place N
of O
the O
monstrous O
town N
was O
still O
marked O
ominously O
on O
the O
sky O
, O
a O
brooding O
gloom N
in O
sunshine N
, O
a O
lurid O
glare N
under O
the O
stars N
. O

And O
this O
also O
, O
said O
Marlow O
suddenly O
, O
has O
been O
one N
of O
the O
dark O
places N
of O
the O
earth N
. O

He O
was O
the O
only O
man H
of O
us H
who O
still O
followed O
the O
sea N
. O

The O
worst O
that O
could O
be O
said O
of O
him O
was O
that O
he O
did O
not O
represent O
his O
class N
. O

He O
was O
a O
seaman H
, O
but O
he O
was O
a O
wanderer H
, O
too O
, O
while O
most O
seamen H
lead O
, O
if O
one N
may O
so O
express O
it O
, O
a O
sedentary O
life N
. O

Their O
minds N
are O
of O
the O
stay-at-home O
order O
, O
and O
their O
home N
is O
always O
with O
them O
– O
the O
ship N
; O
and O
so O
is O
their O
country N
– O
the O
sea N
. O

One O
ship N
is O
very O
much O
like O
another O
, O
and O
the O
sea N
is O
always O
the O
same O
. O

In O
the O
immutability N
of O
their O
surroundings N
the O
foreign O
shores N
, O
the O
foreign O
faces N
, O
the O
changing O
immensity N
of O
life N
, O
glide O
past N
, O
veiled O
not O
by O
a O
sense N
of O
mystery N
but O
by O
a O
slightly O
disdainful O
ignorance N
; O
for O
there O
is O
nothing N
mysterious O
to O
a O
seaman H
unless O
it O
be O
the O
sea N
itself O
, O
which O
is O
the O
mistress H
of O
his O
existence N
and O
as O
inscrutable O
as O
Destiny N
. O

For O
the O
rest N
, O
after O
his O
hours N
of O
work N
, O
a O
casual O
stroll O
or O
a O
casual O
spree N
on O
shore N
suffices O
to O
unfold O
for O
him O
the O
secret O
of O
a O
whole O
continent N
, O
and O
generally O
he O
finds O
the O
secret O
not O
worth N
knowing O
. O

The O
yarns N
of O
seamen H
have O
a O
direct O
simplicity N
, O
the O
whole O
meaning N
of O
which O
lies N
within O
the O
shell N
of O
a O
cracked O
nut N
. O

But O
Marlow O
was O
not O
typical O
( O
if O
his O
propensity N
to O
spin N
yarns N
be O
excepted O
) O
, O
and O
to O
him O
the O
meaning N
of O
an O
episode N
was O
not O
inside O
like O
a O
kernel N
but O
outside O
, O
enveloping O
the O
tale N
which O
brought O
it O
out O
only O
as O
a O
glow N
brings O
out O
a O
haze N
, O
in O
the O
likeness N
of O
one N
of O
these O
misty O
halos N
that O
sometimes O
are O
made O
visible O
by O
the O
spectral O
illumination N
of O
moonshine N
. O

His O
remark N
did O
not O
seem O
at O
all O
surprising O
. O

It O
was O
just O
like O
Marlow O
. O
It O
was O
accepted O
in O
silence N
. O

No O
one N
took O
the O
trouble N
to O
grunt N
even O
; O
and O
presently O
he O
said O
, O
very O
slow O
– O

I H
was O
thinking O
of O
very O
old O
times N
, O
when O
the O
Romans O
first O
came O
here O
, O
nineteen O
hundred O
years N
ago O
– O
the O
other O
day N
... O
. O

Light O
came O
out O
of O
this O
river N
since O
– O
you H
say O
Knights O
? O

Yes O
; O
but O
it O
is O
like O
a O
running O
blaze N
on O
a O
plain O
, O
like O
a O
flash N
of O
lightning N
in O
the O
clouds N
. O

We H
live O
in O
the O
flicker O
– O
may O
it O
last O
as O
long O
as O
the O
old O
earth N
keeps O
rolling O
! O

But O
darkness N
was O
here O
yesterday N
. O

Imagine O
the O
feelings N
of O
a O
commander H
of O
a O
fine O
– O
what'd O
what O
'd O
'ye O
call O
'em O
? O
– O
trireme N
in O
the O
Mediterranean N
, O
ordered O
suddenly O
to O
the O
north O
; O
run O
overland O
across O
the O
Gauls H
in O
a O
hurry N
; O
put O
in O
charge O
of O
one N
of O
these O
craft N
the O
legionaries H
, O
– O
a O
wonderful O
lot N
of O
handy O
men H
they O
must O
have O
been O
too O
– O
used O
to O
build O
, O
apparently O
by O
the O
hundred O
, O
in O
a O
month N
or O
two O
, O
if O
we H
may O
believe O
what O
we H
read O
. O

Imagine O
him O
here O
– O
the O
very O
end N
of O
the O
world N
, O
a O
sea N
the O
color N
of O
lead O
, O
a O
sky O
the O
color N
of O
smoke O
, O
a O
kind N
of O
ship N
about O
as O
rigid O
as O
a O
concertina N
– O
and O
going O
up O
this O
river N
with O
stores N
, O
or O
orders N
, O
or O
what O
you H
like O
. O

Sandbanks N
, O
marshes N
, O
forests N
, O
savages H
, O
– O
precious O
little O
to O
eat O
fit O
for O
a O
civilized O
man H
, O
nothing N
but O
Thames O
water N
to O
drink N
. O

No O
Falernian O
wine N
here O
, O
no O
going O
ashore O
. O

Here O
and O
there O
a O
military O
camp N
lost O
in O
a O
wilderness N
, O
like O
a O
needle N
in O
a O
bundle N
of O
hay N
– O
cold O
, O
fog N
, O
tempests N
, O
disease N
, O
exile H
, O
and O
death N
, O
– O
death N
skulking O
in O
the O
air N
, O
in O
the O
water N
, O
in O
the O
bush N
. O

They O
must O
have O
been O
dying O
like O
flies O
here O
. O

Oh O
yes O
– O
he O
did O
it O
. O

Did O
it O
very O
well O
, O
too O
, O
no O
doubt O
, O
and O
without O
thinking O
much O
about O
it O
either O
, O
except O
afterwards O
to O
brag O
of O
what O
he O
had O
gone O
through O
in O
his O
time N
, O
perhaps O
. O

They O
were O
men H
enough O
to O
face N
the O
darkness N
. O

And O
perhaps O
he O
was O
cheered O
by O
keeping N
his O
eye N
on O
a O
chance N
of O
promotion N
to O
the O
fleet N
at O
Ravenna O
by-and-by O
, O
if O
he O
had O
good O
friends H
in O
Rome O
and O
survived O
the O
awful O
climate N
. O

Or O
think O
of O
a O
decent O
young O
citizen H
in O
a O
toga N
– O
perhaps O
too O
much O
dice N
, O
you H
know O
– O
coming O
out O
here O
in O
the O
train N
of O
some O
prefect H
, O
or O
tax-gatherer O
, O
or O
trader H
even O
, O
to O
mend O
his O
fortunes N
. O

Land N
in O
a O
swamp N
, O
march N
through O
the O
woods N
, O
and O
in O
some O
inland O
post N
feel O
the O
savagery N
, O
the O
utter O
savagery N
, O
had O
closed O
round O
him O
, O
– O
all O
that O
mysterious O
life N
of O
the O
wilderness N
that O
stirs O
in O
the O
forest N
, O
in O
the O
jungles N
, O
in O
the O
hearts N
of O
wild O
men H
. O

There's O
There O
's H
no O
initiation N
either O
into O
such O
mysteries N
. O

He O
has O
to O
live O
in O
the O
midst N
of O
the O
incomprehensible O
, O
which O
is O
also O
detestable O
. O

And O
it O
has O
a O
fascination N
, O
too O
, O
that O
goes O
to O
work N
upon O
him O
. O

The O
fascination N
of O
the O
abomination H
– O
you H
know O
. O

Imagine O
the O
growing O
regrets N
, O
the O
longing O
to O
escape O
, O
the O
powerless O
disgust N
, O
the O
surrender N
, O
the O
hate O
. O

He O
paused O
. O

Mind N
, O
he O
began O
again O
, O
lifting O
one N
arm N
from O
the O
elbow N
, O
the O
palm A
of O
the O
hand N
outwards O
, O
so O
that O
, O
with O
his O
legs N
folded O
before O
him O
, O
he O
had O
the O
pose O
of O
a O
Buddha H
preaching O
in O
European O
clothes N
and O
without O
a O
lotus-flower O
– O
Mind N
, O
none N
of O
us H
would O
feel O
exactly O
like O
this O
. O

What O
saves O
us H
is O
efficiency N
– O
the O
devotion N
to O
efficiency N
. O

But O
these O
chaps H
were O
not O
much O
account O
, O
really O
. O

They O
were O
no O
colonists H
; O
their O
administration N
was O
merely O
a O
squeeze O
, O
and O
nothing N
more O
, O
I H
suspect O
. O

They O
were O
conquerors H
, O
and O
for O
that O
you H
want O
only O
brute O
force N
– O
nothing N
to O
boast O
of O
, O
when O
you H
have O
it O
, O
since O
your H
strength N
is O
just O
an O
accident N
arising O
from O
the O
weakness N
of O
others O
. O

They O
grabbed O
what O
they O
could O
get O
for O
the O
sake N
of O
what O
was O
to O
be O
got O
. O

It O
was O
just O
robbery N
with O
violence N
, O
aggravated O
murder O
on O
a O
great O
scale N
, O
and O
men H
going O
at O
it O
blind O
– O
as O
is O
very O
proper O
for O
those O
who O
tackle O
a O
darkness N
. O

The O
conquest N
of O
the O
earth N
, O
which O
mostly O
means N
the O
taking O
it O
away O
from O
those O
who O
have O
a O
different O
complexion N
or O
slightly O
flatter O
noses N
than O
ourselves H
, O
is O
not O
a O
pretty O
thing N
when O
you H
look O
into O
it O
too O
much O
. O

What O
redeems O
it O
is O
the O
idea N
only O
. O

An O
idea N
at O
the O
back O
of O
it O
; O
not O
a O
sentimental O
pretense N
but O
an O
idea N
; O
and O
an O
unselfish O
belief N
in O
the O
idea N
– O
something O
you H
can O
set O
up O
, O
and O
bow N
down O
before O
, O
and O
offer O
a O
sacrifice N
to O
... O
. O

He O
broke O
off O
. O

Flames N
glided O
in O
the O
river N
, O
small O
green O
flames N
, O
red O
flames N
, O
white O
flames N
, O
pursuing O
, O
overtaking O
, O
joining O
, O
crossing O
each O
other O
– O
then O
separating O
slowly O
or O
hastily O
. O

The O
traffic N
of O
the O
great O
city N
went O
on O
in O
the O
deepening N
night N
upon O
the O
sleepless O
river N
. O

We H
looked O
on O
, O
waiting O
patiently O
– O
there O
was O
nothing N
else O
to O
do O
till O
the O
end N
of O
the O
flood N
; O
but O
it O
was O
only O
after O
a O
long O
silence N
, O
when O
he O
said O
, O
in O
a O
hesitating O
voice H
, O
I H
suppose O
you H
fellows H
remember O
I H
did O
once O
turn O
fresh-water O
sailor H
for O
a O
bit N
, O
that O
we H
knew O
we H
were O
fated O
, O
before O
the O
ebb N
began O
to O
run O
, O
to O
hear O
about O
one N
of O
Marlow's O
Marlow O
's H
inconclusive O
experiences N
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
bother O
you H
much O
with O
what O
happened O
to O
me H
personally O
he O
began O
, O
showing O
in O
this O
remark N
the O
weakness N
of O
many O
tellers H
of O
tales N
who O
seem O
so O
often O
unaware O
of O
what O
their O
audience N
would O
best O
like O
to O
hear O
; O

yet O
to O
understand O
the O
effect N
of O
it O
on O
me H
you H
ought O
to O
know O
how O
I H
got O
out O
there O
, O
what O
I H
saw O
, O
how O
I H
went O
up O
that O
river N
to O
the O
place N
where O
I H
first O
met O
the O
poor O
chap H
. O

It O
was O
the O
farthest O
point N
of O
navigation N
and O
the O
culminating O
point N
of O
my H
experience N
. O

It O
seemed O
somehow O
to O
throw O
a O
kind N
of O
light N
on O
everything O
about O
me H
– O
and O
into O
my H
thoughts N
. O

It O
was O
somber O
enough O
too O
– O
and O
pitiful O
– O
not O
extraordinary O
in O
any O
way N
– O
not O
very O
clear N
either O
. O

No O
, O
not O
very O
clear N
. O

And O
yet O
it O
seemed O
to O
throw O
a O
kind N
of O
light N
. O

I H
had O
then O
, O
as O
you H
remember O
, O
just O
returned O
to O
London O
after O
a O
lot N
of O
Indian O
Ocean O
, O
Pacific O
, O
China O
Seas O
– O
a O
regular O
dose N
of O
the O
East O
– O
six O
years N
or O
so O
, O
and O
I H
was O
loafing O
about O
, O
hindering O
you H
fellows H
in O
your H
work N
and O
invading O
your H
homes N
, O
just O
as O
though O
I H
had O
got O
a O
heavenly O
mission N
to O
civilize O
you H
. O

It O
was O
very O
fine O
for O
a O
time N
, O
but O
after O
a O
bit N
I H
did O
get O
tired O
of O
resting O
. O

Then O
I H
began O
to O
look O
for O
a O
ship N
– O
I H
should O
think O
the O
hardest O
work N
on O
earth N
. O

But O
the O
ships N
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
even O
look O
at O
me H
. O

And O
I H
got O
tired O
of O
that O
game N
too O
. O

Now O
when O
I H
was O
a O
little O
chap H
I H
had O
a O
passion N
for O
maps N
. O

I H
would O
look O
for O
hours N
at O
South O
America O
, O
or O
Africa O
, O
or O
Australia O
, O
and O
lose O
myself H
in O
all O
the O
glories N
of O
exploration N
. O

At O
that O
time N
there O
were O
many O
blank O
spaces N
on O
the O
earth N
, O
and O
when O
I H
saw O
one N
that O
looked O
particularly O
inviting O
on O
a O
map N
( O
but O
they O
all O
look O
that O
) O
I H
would O
put O
my H
finger N
on O
it O
and O
say O
, O
' O
When O
I H
grow O
up O
I H
will O
go O
there O
. O
' O

The O
North O
Pole O
was O
one N
of O
these O
places N
, O
I H
remember O
. O

Well O
, O
I H
haven't O
have O
n't O
been O
there O
yet O
, O
and O
shall O
not O
try O
now O
. O

The O
glamour's O
glamour N
's H
off O
. O

Other O
places N
were O
scattered O
about O
the O
Equator N
, O
and O
in O
every O
sort N
of O
latitude N
all O
over O
the O
two O
hemispheres N
. O

I H
have O
been O
in O
some O
of O
them O
, O
and O
... O
well O
, O
we H
won't O
wo O
n't O
talk O
about O
that O
. O

But O
there O
was O
one N
yet O
– O
the O
biggest O
, O
the O
most O
blank O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
– O
that O
I H
had O
a O
hankering O
after O
. O

True O
, O
by O
this O
time N
it O
was O
not O
a O
blank O
space N
any O
more O
. O

It O
had O
got O
filled O
since O
my H
boyhood N
with O
rivers N
and O
lakes N
and O
names N
. O

It O
had O
ceased O
to O
be O
a O
blank O
space N
of O
delightful O
mystery N
– O
a O
white O
patch N
for O
a O
boy H
to O
dream O
gloriously O
over O
. O

It O
had O
become O
a O
place N
of O
darkness N
. O

But O
there O
was O
in O
it O
one N
river N
especially O
, O
a O
mighty O
big O
river N
, O
that O
you H
could O
see O
on O
the O
map N
, O
resembling O
an O
immense O
snake A
uncoiled O
, O
with O
its O
head N
in O
the O
sea N
, O
its O
body N
at O
rest N
curving O
afar O
over O
a O
vast O
country N
, O
and O
its O
tail N
lost O
in O
the O
depths N
of O
the O
land O
. O

And O
as O
I H
looked O
at O
the O
map N
of O
it O
in O
a O
shop-window O
, O
it O
fascinated O
me H
as O
a O
snake A
would O
a O
bird A
– O
a O
silly O
little O
bird A
. O

Then O
I H
remembered O
there O
was O
a O
big O
concern N
, O
a O
Company O
for O
trade N
on O
that O
river N
. O

Dash O
it O
all O
! O
I H
thought O
to O
myself H
, O
they O
can't O
ca O
n't O
trade N
without O
using O
some O
kind N
of O
craft N
on O
that O
lot N
of O
fresh O
water N
– O
steamboats N
! O

Why O
shouldn't O
should O
n't O
I H
try O
to O
get O
charge O
of O
one N
? O

I H
went O
on O
along O
Fleet O
Street N
, O
but O
could O
not O
shake O
off O
the O
idea N
. O

The O
snake A
had O
charmed O
me H
. O

You H
understand O
it O
was O
a O
Continental O
concern N
, O
that O
Trading O
society N
; O
but O
I H
have O
a O
lot N
of O
relations N
living O
on O
the O
Continent N
, O
because O
it's O
it O
's H
cheap O
and O
not O
so O
nasty O
as O
it O
looks O
, O
they O
say O
. O

I H
ventured O
to O
hint O
that O
the O
Company O
was O
run O
for O
profit N
. O

You H
forget O
, O
dear O
Charlie H
, O
that O
the O
laborer H
is O
worthy O
of O
his O
hire O
, O
she O
said O
, O
brightly O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
queer O
how O
out O
of O
touch O
with O
truth N
women H
are O
. O

They O
live O
in O
a O
world N
of O
their O
own O
, O
and O
there O
had O
never O
been O
anything O
like O
it O
, O
and O
never O
can O
be O
. O

It O
is O
too O
beautiful O
altogether O
, O
and O
if O
they O
were O
to O
set O
it O
up O
it O
would O
go O
to O
pieces N
before O
the O
first O
sunset N
. O

Some O
confounded O
fact N
we H
men H
have O
been O
living O
contentedly O
with O
ever O
since O
the O
day N
of O
creation N
would O
start O
up O
and O
knock O
the O
whole O
thing N
over O
. O

After O
this O
I H
got O
embraced O
, O
told O
to O
wear O
flannel N
, O
be O
sure O
to O
write O
often O
, O
and O
so O
on O
– O
and O
I H
left O
. O

In O
the O
street N
– O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
– O
a O
queer O
feeling O
came O
to O
me H
that O
I H
was O
an O
impostor H
. O

Odd O
thing N
that O
I H
, O
who O
used O
to O
clear N
out O
for O
any O
part N
of O
the O
world N
at O
twenty-four O
hours N
' O
notice O
, O
with O
less O
thought O
than O
most O
men H
give O
to O
the O
crossing O
of O
a O
street N
, O
had O
a O
moment N
– O
I H
won't O
wo O
n't O
say O
of O
hesitation N
, O
but O
of O
startled O
pause O
, O
before O
this O
commonplace O
affair N
. O

The O
best O
way N
I H
can O
explain O
it O
to O
you H
is O
by O
saying O
that O
, O
for O
a O
second N
or O
two O
, O
I H
felt N
as O
though O
, O
instead O
of O
going O
to O
the O
center N
of O
a O
continent N
, O
I H
were O
about O
to O
set O
off O
for O
the O
center N
of O
the O
earth N
. O

I H
left O
in O
a O
French O
steamer N
, O
and O
she O
called O
in O
every O
blamed O
port N
they O
have O
out O
there O
, O
for O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I H
could O
see O
, O
the O
sole O
purpose N
of O
landing N
soldiers H
and O
custom-house O
officers H
. O

I H
watched O
the O
coast N
. O

Watching O
a O
coast N
as O
it O
slips O
by O
the O
ship N
is O
like O
thinking O
about O
an O
enigma N
. O

There O
it O
is O
before O
you H
– O
smiling O
, O
frowning O
, O
inviting O
, O
grand O
, O
mean O
, O
insipid O
, O
or O
savage H
, O
and O
always O
mute O
with O
an O
air N
of O
whispering O
, O
' O
Come O
and O
find O
out O
. O

' O
This O
one N
was O
almost O
featureless O
, O
as O
if O
still O
in O
the O
making O
, O
with O
an O
aspect N
of O
monotonous O
grimness N
. O

The O
edge N
of O
a O
colossal O
jungle N
, O
so O
dark-green O
as O
to O
be O
almost O
black O
, O
fringed O
with O
white O
surf N
, O
ran O
straight O
, O
like O
a O
ruled O
line N
, O
far O
, O
far O
away O
along O
a O
blue O
sea N
whose O
glitter N
was O
blurred O
by O
a O
creeping O
mist N
. O

The O
sun N
was O
fierce O
, O
the O
land O
seemed O
to O
glisten O
and O
drip N
with O
steam N
. O

Here O
and O
there O
grayish-whitish O
specks N
showed O
up O
, O
clustered O
inside O
the O
white O
surf N
, O
with O
a O
flag N
flying O
above O
them O
perhaps O
. O

Settlements N
some O
centuries N
old O
, O
and O
still O
no O
bigger O
than O
pin-heads O
on O
the O
untouched O
expanse N
of O
their O
background N
. O

We H
pounded O
along O
, O
stopped O
, O
landed O
soldiers H
; O
went O
on O
, O
landed O
custom-house O
clerks H
to O
levy O
toll N
in O
what O
looked O
like O
a O
God-forsaken O
wilderness N
, O
with O
a O
tin N
shed O
and O
a O
flag-pole O
lost O
in O
it O
; O
landed O
more O
soldiers H
– O
to O
take O
care N
of O
the O
custom-house O
clerks H
, O
presumably O
. O

Some O
, O
I H
heard O
, O
got O
drowned O
in O
the O
surf N
; O
but O
whether O
they O
did O
or O
not O
, O
nobody H
seemed O
particularly O
to O
care N
. O

They O
were O
just O
flung O
out O
there O
, O
and O
on O
we H
went O
. O

Every O
day N
the O
coast N
looked O
the O
same O
, O
as O
though O
we H
had O
not O
moved O
; O
but O
we H
passed O
various O
places N
– O
trading N
places N
– O
with O
names N
like O
Gran' O
Bassam O
Little O
Popo O
, O
names N
that O
seemed O
to O
belong O
to O
some O
sordid O
farce N
acted O
in O
front N
of O
a O
sinister O
backcloth N
. O

The O
idleness N
of O
a O
passenger H
, O
my H
isolation N
amongst O
all O
these O
men H
with O
whom O
I H
had O
no O
point N
of O
contact O
, O
the O
oily O
and O
languid O
sea N
, O
the O
uniform N
somberness N
of O
the O
coast N
, O
seemed O
to O
keep O
me H
away O
from O
the O
truth N
of O
things N
, O
within O
the O
toil N
of O
a O
mournful O
and O
senseless O
delusion N
. O

The O
voice H
of O
the O
surf N
heard O
now O
and O
then O
was O
a O
positive N
pleasure N
, O
like O
the O
speech N
of O
a O
brother H
. O

It O
was O
something O
natural O
, O
that O
had O
its O
reason N
, O
that O
had O
a O
meaning N
. O

Now O
and O
then O
a O
boat N
from O
the O
shore N
gave O
one N
a O
momentary O
contact O
with O
reality N
. O

It O
was O
paddled O
by O
black O
fellows H
. O

You H
could O
see O
from O
afar O
the O
white O
of O
their O
eyeballs N
glistening O
. O

They O
shouted O
, O
sang O
; O
their O
bodies N
streamed O
with O
perspiration N
; O
they O
had O
faces N
like O
grotesque O
masks N
– O
these O
chaps H
; O
but O
they O
had O
bone N
, O
muscle N
, O
a O
wild O
vitality N
, O
an O
intense O
energy N
of O
movement N
, O
that O
was O
as O
natural O
and O
true O
as O
the O
surf N
along O
their O
coast N
. O

They O
wanted O
no O
excuse O
for O
being O
there O
. O
They O
were O
a O
great O
comfort O
to O
look O
at O
. O

For O
a O
time N
I H
would O
feel O
I H
belonged O
still O
to O
a O
world N
of O
straightforward O
facts N
; O
but O
the O
feeling O
would O
not O
last O
long O
. O

Something O
would O
turn O
up O
to O
scare O
it O
away O
. O

Once O
, O
I H
remember O
, O
we H
came O
upon O
a O
man-of-war N
anchored O
off O
the O
coast N
. O

There O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
even O
a O
shed O
there O
, O
and O
she O
was O
shelling O
the O
bush N
. O

It O
appears O
the O
French O
had O
one N
of O
their O
wars N
going O
on O
thereabouts O
. O

Her O
ensign H
dropped O
limp O
like O
a O
rag N
; O
the O
muzzles N
of O
the O
long O
eight-inch O
guns N
stuck O
out O
all O
over O
the O
low O
hull N
; O
the O
greasy O
, O
slimy O
swell N
swung O
her O
up O
lazily O
and O
let O
her O
down O
, O
swaying O
her O
thin O
masts N
. O

In O
the O
empty O
immensity N
of O
earth N
, O
sky O
, O
and O
water N
, O
there O
she O
was O
, O
incomprehensible O
, O
firing O
into O
a O
continent N
. O

Pop N
, O
would O
go O
one N
of O
the O
eight-inch O
guns N
; O
a O
small O
flame N
would O
dart O
and O
vanish O
, O
a O
little O
white O
smoke O
would O
disappear O
, O
a O
tiny O
projectile N
would O
give O
a O
feeble O
screech N
– O
and O
nothing N
happened O
. O

Nothing N
could O
happen O
. O

There O
was O
a O
touch O
of O
insanity N
in O
the O
proceeding O
, O
a O
sense N
of O
lugubrious O
drollery N
in O
the O
sight N
; O
and O
it O
was O
not O
dissipated O
by O
somebody H
on O
board N
assuring O
me H
earnestly O
there O
was O
a O
camp N
of O
natives H
– O
he O
called O
them O
enemies H
! O
– O
hidden O
out O
of O
sight N
somewhere O
. O

We H
gave O
her O
her O
letters N
( O
I H
heard O
the O
men H
in O
that O
lonely O
ship N
were O
dying O
of O
fever N
at O
the O
rate N
of O
three O
a O
day N
) O
and O
went O
on O
. O

We H
called O
at O
some O
more O
places N
with O
farcical O
names N
, O
where O
the O
merry O
dance O
of O
death N
and O
trade N
goes O
on O
in O
a O
still O
and O
earthy O
atmosphere N
as O
of O
an O
overheated O
catacomb N
; O
all O
along O
the O
formless O
coast N
bordered O
by O
dangerous O
surf N
, O
as O
if O
Nature H
herself O
had O
tried O
to O
ward O
off O
intruders H
; O
in O
and O
out O
of O
rivers N
, O
streams N
of O
death N
in O
life N
, O
whose O
banks N
were O
rotting O
into O
mud N
, O
whose O
waters N
, O
thickened O
into O
slime N
, O
invaded O
the O
contorted O
mangroves A
, O
that O
seemed O
to O
writhe O
at O
us H
in O
the O
extremity N
of O
an O
impotent O
despair N
. O

Nowhere O
did O
we H
stop N
long O
enough O
to O
get O
a O
particularized O
impression N
, O
but O
the O
general O
sense N
of O
vague O
and O
oppressive O
wonder O
grew O
upon O
me H
. O

It O
was O
like O
a O
weary O
pilgrimage N
amongst O
hints N
for O
nightmares N
. O

It O
was O
upward O
of O
thirty O
days N
before O
I H
saw O
the O
mouth N
of O
the O
big O
river N
. O

We H
anchored O
off O
the O
seat N
of O
the O
government N
. O

But O
my H
work N
would O
not O
begin O
till O
some O
two O
hundred O
miles N
farther O
on O
. O
So O
as O
soon O
as O
I H
could O
I H
made O
a O
start O
for O
a O
place N
thirty O
miles N
higher O
up O
. O

I H
had O
my H
passage N
on O
a O
little O
sea-going O
steamer N
. O

Her O
captain H
was O
a O
Swede H
, O
and O
knowing O
me H
for O
a O
seaman H
, O
invited O
me H
on O
the O
bridge N
. O

He O
was O
a O
young O
man H
, O
lean O
, O
fair O
, O
and O
morose O
, O
with O
lanky O
hair N
and O
a O
shuffling O
gait N
. O

As O
we H
left O
the O
miserable O
little O
wharf N
, O
he O
tossed O
his O
head N
contemptuously O
at O
the O
shore N
. O

Been O
living O
there O
? O
he O
asked O
. O

I H
said O
, O
Yes O
. O

Fine O
lot N
these O
government N
chaps H
– O
are O
they O
not O
? O
he O
went O
on O
, O
speaking O
English O
with O
great O
precision N
and O
considerable O
bitterness N
. O

It O
is O
funny O
what O
some O
people N
will O
do O
for O
a O
few O
francs N
a O
month N
. O

I H
wonder O
what O
becomes O
of O
that O
kind N
when O
it O
goes O
up O
country N
? O

I H
said O
to O
him O
I H
expected O
to O
see O
that O
soon O
. O

So-o-o O
! O
he O
exclaimed O
. O

He O
shuffled O
athwart O
, O
keeping N
one N
eye N
ahead O
vigilantly O
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
be O
too O
sure O
, O
he O
continued O
. O

The O
other O
day N
I H
took O
up O
a O
man H
who O
hanged O
himself O
on O
the O
road N
. O

He O
was O
a O
Swede H
, O
too O
. O

Hanged O
himself O
! O

Why O
, O
in O
God's O
God H
's H
name N
? O
I H
cried O
. O

He O
kept O
on O
looking O
out O
watchfully O
. O

Who O
knows O
? O

The O
sun N
too O
much O
for O
him O
, O
or O
the O
country N
perhaps O
. O

At O
last O
we H
opened O
a O
reach O
. O

A O
rocky O
cliff N
appeared O
, O
mounds N
of O
turned-up O
earth N
by O
the O
shore N
, O
houses N
on O
a O
hill N
, O
others O
, O
with O
iron N
roofs N
, O
amongst O
a O
waste O
of O
excavations N
, O
or O
hanging O
to O
the O
declivity N
. O

A O
continuous O
noise N
of O
the O
rapids N
above O
hovered O
over O
this O
scene N
of O
inhabited O
devastation N
. O

A O
lot N
of O
people N
, O
mostly O
black O
and O
naked O
, O
moved O
about O
like O
ants A
. O

A O
jetty N
projected O
into O
the O
river N
. O

A O
blinding O
sunlight N
drowned O
all O
this O
at O
times N
in O
a O
sudden O
recrudescence N
of O
glare N
. O

There's O
There O
's H
your H
Company's O
Company O
's H
station N
, O
said O
the O
Swede H
, O
pointing O
to O
three O
wooden O
barrack-like O
structures N
on O
the O
rocky O
slope N
. O

' O
I H
will O
send O
your H
things N
up O
. O

Four O
boxes N
did O
you H
say O
? O

So O
. O
Farewell O
. O

' O
I H
came O
upon O
a O
boiler N
wallowing O
in O
the O
grass A
, O
then O
found O
a O
path N
leading N
up O
the O
hill N
. O

It O
turned O
aside O
for O
the O
bowlders N
, O
and O
also O
for O
an O
undersized O
railway-truck O
lying O
there O
on O
its O
back O
with O
its O
wheels N
in O
the O
air N
. O

One O
was O
off O
. O

The O
thing N
looked O
as O
dead O
as O
the O
carcass N
of O
some O
animal A
. O

I H
came O
upon O
more O
pieces N
of O
decaying O
machinery N
, O
a O
stack O
of O
rusty O
rails N
. O

To O
the O
left O
a O
clump N
of O
trees A
made O
a O
shady O
spot N
, O
where O
dark O
things N
seemed O
to O
stir O
feebly O
. O

I H
blinked O
, O
the O
path N
was O
steep O
. O

A O
horn N
tooted O
to O
the O
right O
, O
and O
I H
saw O
the O
black O
people N
run O
. O
A O
heavy O
and O
dull O
detonation N
shook O
the O
ground N
, O
a O
puff O
of O
smoke O
came O
out O
of O
the O
cliff N
, O
and O
that O
was O
all O
. O

No O
change O
appeared O
on O
the O
face N
of O
the O
rock N
. O

They O
were O
building N
a O
railway N
. O

The O
cliff N
was O
not O
in O
the O
way N
or O
anything O
; O
but O
this O
objectless O
blasting O
was O
all O
the O
work N
going O
on O
. O

A O
slight O
clinking O
behind O
me H
made O
me H
turn O
my H
head N
. O

Six O
black O
men H
advanced O
in O
a O
file N
, O
toiling O
up O
the O
path N
. O
They O
walked O
erect O
and O
slow O
, O
balancing O
small O
baskets N
full O
of O
earth N
on O
their O
heads N
, O
and O
the O
clink N
kept O
time N
with O
their O
footsteps N
. O

Black O
rags N
were O
wound N
round O
their O
loins N
, O
and O
the O
short O
ends O
behind O
wagged O
to O
and O
fro O
like O
tails N
. O

I H
could O
see O
every O
rib N
, O
the O
joints N
of O
their O
limbs N
were O
like O
knots N
in O
a O
rope N
; O
each O
had O
an O
iron N
collar N
on O
his O
neck N
, O
and O
all O
were O
connected O
together O
with O
a O
chain N
whose O
bights N
swung O
between O
them O
, O
rhythmically O
clinking O
. O

Another O
report N
from O
the O
cliff N
made O
me H
think O
suddenly O
of O
that O
ship N
of O
war N
I H
had O
seen O
firing O
into O
a O
continent N
. O

It O
was O
the O
same O
kind N
of O
ominous O
voice H
; O
but O
these O
men H
could O
by O
no O
stretch O
of O
imagination N
be O
called O
enemies H
. O

They O
were O
called O
criminals H
, O
and O
the O
outraged O
law N
, O
like O
the O
bursting O
shells N
, O
had O
come O
to O
them O
, O
an O
insoluble O
mystery N
from O
over O
the O
sea N
. O

All O
their O
meager O
breasts N
panted O
together O
, O
the O
violently O
dilated O
nostrils N
quivered O
, O
the O
eyes N
stared O
stonily O
uphill O
. O

They O
passed O
me H
within O
six O
inches N
, O
without O
a O
glance N
, O
with O
that O
complete O
, O
deathlike O
indifference N
of O
unhappy O
savages H
. O

Behind O
this O
raw O
matter N
one N
of O
the O
reclaimed O
, O
the O
product N
of O
the O
new O
forces N
at O
work N
, O
strolled O
despondently O
, O
carrying O
a O
rifle N
by O
its O
middle O
. O

He O
had O
a O
uniform N
jacket N
with O
one N
button N
off O
, O
and O
seeing O
a O
white O
man H
on O
the O
path N
, O
hoisted O
his O
weapon N
to O
his O
shoulder N
with O
alacrity N
. O

This O
was O
simple O
prudence N
, O
white O
men H
being O
so O
much O
alike O
at O
a O
distance N
that O
he O
could O
not O
tell O
who O
I H
might O
be O
. O

He O
was O
speedily O
reassured O
, O
and O
with O
a O
large O
, O
white O
, O
rascally O
grin N
, O
and O
a O
glance N
at O
his O
charge O
, O
seemed O
to O
take O
me H
into O
partnership N
in O
his O
exalted O
trust N
. O

After O
all O
, O
I H
also O
was O
a O
part N
of O
the O
great O
cause N
of O
these O
high O
and O
just O
proceedings N
. O

Instead O
of O
going O
up O
, O
I H
turned O
and O
descended O
to O
the O
left O
. O

My H
idea N
was O
to O
let O
that O
chain-gang O
get O
out O
of O
sight N
before O
I H
climbed O
the O
hill N
. O

You H
know O
I H
am O
not O
particularly O
tender O
; O

I've O
I H
've O
had O
to O
strike N
and O
to O
fend O
off O
. O
I've O
I H
've O
had O
to O
resist O
and O
to O
attack N
sometimes O
– O
that's O
that O
's H
only O
one N
way N
of O
resisting O
– O
without O
counting O
the O
exact O
cost O
, O
according O
to O
the O
demands O
of O
such O
sort N
of O
life N
as O
I H
had O
blundered O
into O
. O

I've O
I H
've O
seen O
the O
devil A
of O
violence N
, O
and O
the O
devil A
of O
greed N
, O
and O
the O
devil A
of O
hot O
desire N
; O
but O
, O
by O
all O
the O
stars N
! O
these O
were O
strong O
, O
lusty O
, O
red-eyed O
devils A
, O
that O
swayed O
and O
drove O
men H
– O
men H
, O
I H
tell O
you H
. O

But O
as O
I H
stood O
on O
this O
hillside N
, O
I H
foresaw O
that O
in O
the O
blinding O
sunshine N
of O
that O
land O
I H
would O
become O
acquainted O
with O
a O
flabby O
, O
pretending O
, O
weak-eyed O
devil A
of O
a O
rapacious O
and O
pitiless O
folly N
. O

How O
insidious O
he O
could O
be O
, O
too O
, O
I H
was O
only O
to O
find O
out O
several O
months N
later O
and O
a O
thousand O
miles N
farther O
. O

For O
a O
moment N
I H
stood O
appalled O
, O
as O
though O
by O
a O
warning N
. O

Finally O
I H
descended O
the O
hill N
, O
obliquely O
, O
towards O
the O
trees A
I H
had O
seen O
. O

I H
avoided O
a O
vast O
artificial O
hole N
somebody H
had O
been O
digging O
on O
the O
slope N
, O
the O
purpose N
of O
which O
I H
found O
it O
impossible O
to O
divine O
. O

It O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
a O
quarry H
or O
a O
sandpit N
, O
anyhow O
. O

It O
was O
just O
a O
hole N
. O

It O
might O
have O
been O
connected O
with O
the O
philanthropic O
desire N
of O
giving O
the O
criminals H
something O
to O
do O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Then O
I H
nearly O
fell O
into O
a O
very O
narrow O
ravine N
, O
almost O
no O
more O
than O
a O
scar N
in O
the O
hillside N
. O

I H
discovered O
that O
a O
lot N
of O
imported O
drainage-pipes O
for O
the O
settlement N
had O
been O
tumbled O
in O
there O
. O

There O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
one N
that O
was O
not O
broken O
. O

It O
was O
a O
wanton O
smash-up N
. O

at O
last O
I H
got O
under O
the O
trees A
. O

My H
purpose N
was O
to O
stroll O
into O
the O
shade N
for O
a O
moment N
; O
but O
no O
sooner O
within O
than O
it O
seemed O
to O
me H
I H
had O
stepped O
into O
a O
gloomy O
circle N
of O
some O
Inferno N
. O

The O
rapids N
were O
near O
, O
and O
an O
uninterrupted O
, O
uniform N
, O
headlong O
, O
rushing O
noise N
filled O
the O
mournful O
stillness N
of O
the O
grove N
, O
where O
not O
a O
breath N
stirred O
, O
not O
a O
leaf N
moved O
, O
with O
a O
mysterious O
sound N
– O
as O
though O
the O
tearing O
pace N
of O
the O
launched O
earth N
had O
suddenly O
become O
audible O
. O

Black O
shapes O
crouched O
, O
lay O
, O
sat O
between O
the O
trees A
, O
leaning O
against O
the O
trunks N
, O
clinging O
to O
the O
earth N
, O
half O
coming O
out O
, O
half O
effaced O
within O
the O
dim O
light N
, O
in O
all O
the O
attitudes N
of O
pain N
, O
abandonment N
, O
and O
despair N
. O

He O
is O
waiting O
! O
' O

I H
did O
not O
see O
the O
real O
significance N
of O
that O
wreck N
at O
once O
. O

I H
fancy O
I H
see O
it O
now O
, O
but O
I H
am O
not O
sure O
– O
not O
at O
all O
. O

Certainly O
the O
affair N
was O
too O
stupid O
– O
when O
I H
think O
of O
it O
– O
to O
be O
altogether O
natural O
. O

Still O
... O
. O
But O
at O
the O
moment N
it O
presented O
itself O
simply O
as O
a O
confounded O
nuisance N
. O

The O
steamer N
was O
sunk O
. O

They O
had O
started O
two O
days N
before O
in O
a O
sudden O
hurry N
up O
the O
river N
with O
the O
manager H
on O
board N
, O
in O
charge O
of O
some O
volunteer H
skipper H
, O
and O
before O
they O
had O
been O
out O
three O
hours N
they O
tore O
the O
bottom N
out O
of O
her O
on O
stones N
, O
and O
she O
sank O
near O
the O
south O
bank N
. O

I H
asked O
myself H
what O
I H
was O
to O
do O
there O
, O
now O
my H
boat N
was O
lost O
. O

As O
a O
matter N
of O
fact N
, O
I H
had O
plenty O
to O
do O
in O
fishing N
my H
command O
out O
of O
the O
river N
. O

I H
had O
to O
set O
about O
it O
the O
very O
next O
day N
. O

That O
, O
and O
the O
repairs N
when O
I H
brought O
the O
pieces N
to O
the O
station N
, O
took O
some O
months N
. O

My H
first O
interview N
with O
the O
manager H
was O
curious O
. O

He O
did O
not O
ask O
me H
to O
sit O
down O
after O
my H
twenty-mile O
walk O
that O
morning N
. O

He O
was O
commonplace O
in O
complexion N
, O
in O
features O
, O
in O
manners N
, O
and O
in O
voice H
. O

He O
was O
of O
middle O
size N
and O
of O
ordinary O
build O
. O

His O
eyes N
, O
of O
the O
usual O
blue O
, O
were O
perhaps O
remarkably O
cold O
, O
and O
he O
certainly O
could O
make O
his O
glance N
fall N
on O
one N
as O
trenchant O
and O
heavy O
as O
an O
axe N
. O

But O
even O
at O
these O
times N
the O
rest N
of O
his O
person H
seemed O
to O
disclaim O
the O
intention N
. O

Otherwise O
there O
was O
only O
an O
indefinable O
, O
faint O
expression N
of O
his O
lips N
, O
something O
stealthy O
– O
a O
smile O
– O
not O
a O
smile O
– O
I H
remember O
it O
, O
but O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
explain O
. O

It O
was O
unconscious O
, O
this O
smile O
was O
, O
though O
just O
after O
he O
had O
said O
something O
it O
got O
intensified O
for O
an O
instant O
. O

It O
came O
at O
the O
end N
of O
his O
speeches N
like O
a O
seal O
applied O
on O
the O
words N
to O
make O
the O
meaning N
of O
the O
commonest O
phrase N
appear O
absolutely O
inscrutable O
. O

He O
was O
a O
common O
trader H
, O
from O
his O
youth H
up O
employed O
in O
these O
parts N
– O
nothing N
more O
. O

He O
was O
obeyed O
, O
yet O
he O
inspired O
neither O
love O
nor O
fear N
, O
nor O
even O
respect N
. O

He O
inspired O
uneasiness N
. O
That O
was O
it O
! O
Uneasiness N
. O
Not O
a O
definite O
mistrust N
– O
just O
uneasiness N
– O
nothing N
more O
. O

You H
have O
no O
idea N
how O
effective O
such O
a O
... O
a O
... O
faculty N
can O
be O
. O

He O
had O
no O
genius N
for O
organizing O
, O
for O
initiative N
, O
or O
for O
order O
even O
. O

That O
was O
evident O
in O
such O
things N
as O
the O
deplorable O
state N
of O
the O
station N
. O

He O
had O
no O
learning O
, O
and O
no O
intelligence N
. O

His O
position N
had O
come O
to O
him O
– O
why O
? O
Perhaps O
because O
he O
was O
never O
ill O
... O

He O
had O
served O
three O
terms N
of O
three O
years N
out O
there O
... O
Because O
triumphant O
health N
in O
the O
general O
rout N
of O
constitutions N
is O
a O
kind N
of O
power N
in O
itself O
. O

When O
he O
went O
home N
on O
leave O
he O
rioted O
on O
a O
large O
scale N
– O
pompously O
. O
Jack H
ashore O
– O
with O
a O
difference N
– O
in O
externals N
only O
. O

This O
one N
could O
gather O
from O
his O
casual O
talk O
. O

He O
originated O
nothing N
, O
he O
could O
keep O
the O
routine N
going O
– O
that's O
that O
's H
all O
. O
But O
he O
was O
great O
. O

He O
was O
great O
by O
this O
little O
thing N
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
tell O
what O
could O
control N
such O
a O
man H
. O

He O
never O
gave O
that O
secret O
away O
. O

Perhaps O
there O
was O
nothing N
within O
him O
. O

Such O
a O
suspicion N
made O
one N
pause O
– O
for O
out O
there O
there O
were O
no O
external O
checks N
. O

Once O
when O
various O
tropical O
diseases N
had O
laid O
low O
almost O
every O
agent H
in O
the O
station N
, O
he O
was O
heard O
to O
say O
, O
' O
Men H
who O
come O
out O
here O
should O
have O
no O
entrails O
. O

' O
He O
sealed O
the O
utterance N
with O
that O
smile O
of O
his O
, O
as O
though O
it O
had O
been O
a O
door N
opening N
into O
a O
darkness N
he O
had O
in O
his O
keeping N
. O

You H
fancied O
you H
had O
seen O
things N
– O
but O
the O
seal O
was O
on O
. O

When O
annoyed O
at O
meal-times O
by O
the O
constant O
quarrels N
of O
the O
white O
men H
about O
precedence N
, O
he O
ordered O
an O
immense O
round O
table N
to O
be O
made O
, O
for O
which O
a O
special O
house N
had O
to O
be O
built O
. O

This O
was O
the O
station's O
station N
's H
mess-room O
. O

Where O
he O
sat O
was O
the O
first O
place N
– O
the O
rest N
were O
nowhere O
. O

One O
felt N
this O
to O
be O
his O
unalterable O
conviction N
. O

He O
was O
neither O
civil O
nor O
uncivil O
. O

He O
was O
quiet N
. O

He O
allowed O
his O
boy H
– O
an O
overfed O
young O
negro H
from O
the O
coast N
– O
to O
treat O
the O
white O
men H
, O
under O
his O
very O
eyes N
, O
with O
provoking O
insolence N
. O

He O
began O
to O
speak O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
saw O
me H
. O

I H
had O
been O
very O
long O
on O
the O
road N
. O

He O
could O
not O
wait N
. O
Had O
to O
start O
without O
me H
. O

The O
up-river O
stations N
had O
to O
be O
relieved O
. O

There O
had O
been O
so O
many O
delays N
already O
that O
he O
did O
not O
know O
who O
was O
dead O
and O
who O
was O
alive O
, O
and O
how O
they O
got O
on O
– O
and O
so O
on O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

He O
paid O
no O
attention N
to O
my H
explanations N
, O
and O
, O
playing O
with O
a O
stick N
of O
sealing-wax O
, O
repeated O
several O
times N
that O
the O
situation N
was O
' O
very O
grave O
, O
very O
grave O
. O

There O
were O
rumors N
that O
a O
very O
important O
station N
was O
in O
jeopardy N
, O
and O
its O
chief O
, O
Mr. N
Kurtz O
, O
was O
ill O
. O

Hoped O
it O
was O
not O
true O
. O

Mr. N
Kurtz O
was O
... O

I H
felt N
weary O
and O
irritable O
. O
Hang O
Kurtz O
, O
I H
thought O
. O

I H
interrupted O
him O
by O
saying O
I H
had O
heard O
of O
Mr. N
Kurtz O
on O
the O
coast N
. O

' O
Ah O
! O
So O
they O
talk O
of O
him O
down O
there O
, O
he O
murmured O
to O
himself O
. O

Then O
he O
began O
again O
, O
assuring O
me H
Mr. N
Kurtz O
was O
the O
best O
agent H
he O
had O
, O
an O
exceptional O
man H
, O
of O
the O
greatest O
importance N
to O
the O
Company O
; O
therefore O
I H
could O
understand O
his O
anxiety N
. O

He O
was O
, O
he O
said O
, O
' O
very O
, O
very O
uneasy O
. O
' O

Certainly O
he O
fidgeted O
on O
his O
chair N
a O
good O
deal O
, O
exclaimed O
, O
' O
Ah O
, O
Mr. N
Kurtz O
! O
' O
broke O
the O
stick N
of O
sealing-wax O
and O
seemed O
dumbfounded O
by O
the O
accident N
. O

Next O
thing N
he O
wanted O
to O
know O
' O
how O
long O
it O
would O
take O
to O
' O
... O

I H
interrupted O
him O
again O
. O

Being O
hungry O
, O
you H
know O
, O
and O
kept O
on O
my H
feet N
too O
, O
I H
was O
getting O
savage H
. O

' O
How O
could O
I H
tell O
, O
I H
said O
. O
' O

I H
hadn't O
had O
n't O
even O
seen O
the O
wreck N
yet O
– O
some O
months N
, O
no O
doubt O
. O

All O
this O
talk O
seemed O
to O
me H
so O
futile O
. O

Some O
months N
, O
he O
said O
. O

' O
Well O
, O
let O
us H
say O
three O
months N
before O
we H
can O
make O
a O
start O
. O

Yes O
. O
That O
ought O
to O
do O
the O
affair N
. O

I H
flung O
out O
of O
his O
hut N
( O
he O
lived O
all O
alone O
in O
a O
clay O
hut N
with O
a O
sort N
of O
veranda N
) O
muttering O
to O
myself H
my H
opinion N
of O
him O
. O

He O
was O
a O
chattering O
idiot H
. O

Afterwards O
I H
took O
it O
back O
when O
it O
was O
borne O
in O
upon O
me H
startlingly O
with O
what O
extreme O
nicety N
he O
had O
estimated O
the O
time N
requisite O
for O
the O
' O
affair N
. O
' O

I H
went O
to O
work N
the O
next O
day N
, O
turning O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
my H
back O
on O
that O
station N
. O

In O
that O
way N
only O
it O
seemed O
to O
me H
I H
could O
keep O
my H
hold O
on O
the O
redeeming O
facts N
of O
life N
. O

Still O
, O
one N
must O
look O
about O
sometimes O
; O
and O
then O
I H
saw O
this O
station N
, O
these O
men H
strolling O
aimlessly O
about O
in O
the O
sunshine N
of O
the O
yard N
. O

I H
asked O
myself H
sometimes O
what O
it O
all O
meant O
. O

They O
wandered O
here O
and O
there O
with O
their O
absurd O
long O
staves N
in O
their O
hands N
, O
like O
a O
lot N
of O
faithless O
pilgrims H
bewitched O
inside O
a O
rotten O
fence N
. O

The O
word N
' O
ivory N
' O
rang O
in O
the O
air N
, O
was O
whispered O
, O
was O
sighed O
. O

You H
would O
think O
they O
were O
praying O
to O
it O
. O

A O
taint N
of O
imbecile O
rapacity N
blew O
through O
it O
all O
, O
like O
a O
whiff N
from O
some O
corpse N
. O

By O
Jove O
! O
I've O
I H
've O
never O
seen O
anything O
so O
unreal O
in O
my H
life N
. O

And O
outside O
, O
the O
silent O
wilderness N
surrounding O
this O
cleared O
speck N
on O
the O
earth N
struck O
me H
as O
something O
great O
and O
invincible O
, O
like O
evil O
or O
truth N
, O
waiting O
patiently O
for O
the O
passing O
away O
of O
this O
fantastic O
invasion N
. O

Oh O
, O
these O
months N
! O

Well O
, O
never O
mind N
. O

Various O
things N
happened O
. O

One O
evening N
a O
grass A
shed O
full O
of O
calico N
, O
cotton N
prints O
, O
beads N
, O
and O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
else O
, O
burst O
into O
a O
blaze N
so O
suddenly O
that O
you H
would O
have O
thought O
the O
earth N
had O
opened O
to O
let O
an O
avenging O
fire N
consume O
all O
that O
trash N
. O

I H
was O
smoking O
my H
pipe N
quietly O
by O
my H
dismantled O
steamer N
, O
and O
saw O
them O
all O
cutting N
capers N
in O
the O
light N
, O
with O
their O
arms N
lifted O
high O
, O
when O
the O
stout O
man H
with O
mustaches N
came O
tearing O
down O
to O
the O
river N
, O
a O
tin N
pail N
in O
his O
hand N
, O
assured O
me H
that O
everybody O
was O
' O
behaving O
splendidly O
, O
splendidly O
, O
' O
dipped O
about O
a O
quart N
of O
water N
and O
tore O
back O
again O
. O

I H
noticed O
there O
was O
a O
hole N
in O
the O
bottom N
of O
his O
pail N
. O

I H
strolled O
up O
. O

There O
was O
no O
hurry N
. O

You H
see O
the O
thing N
had O
gone O
off O
like O
a O
box N
of O
matches O
. O

It O
had O
been O
hopeless O
from O
the O
very O
first O
. O
The O
flame N
had O
leaped O
high O
, O
driven O
everybody O
back O
, O
lighted O
up O
everything O
– O
and O
collapsed O
. O

The O
shed O
was O
already O
a O
heap N
of O
embers N
glowing O
fiercely O
. O

A O
nigger H
was O
being O
beaten O
near O
by O
. O

They O
said O
he O
had O
caused O
the O
fire N
in O
some O
way N
; O
be O
that O
as O
it O
may O
, O
he O
was O
screeching O
most O
horribly O
. O

I H
saw O
him O
, O
later O
on O
, O
for O
several O
days N
, O
sitting O
in O
a O
bit N
of O
shade N
looking O
very O
sick O
and O
trying O
to O
recover O
himself O
: O

afterwards O
he O
arose O
and O
went O
out O
– O
and O
the O
wilderness N
without O
a O
sound N
took O
him O
into O
its O
bosom N
again O
. O

As O
I H
approached O
the O
glow N
from O
the O
dark O
I H
found O
myself H
at O
the O
back O
of O
two O
men H
, O
talking O
. O

I H
heard O
the O
name N
of O
Kurtz O
pronounced O
, O
then O
the O
words N
, O
' O
take O
advantage N
of O
this O
unfortunate O
accident N
. O
' O

One O
of O
the O
men H
was O
the O
manager H
. O

I H
wished O
him O
a O
good O
evening N
. O

Did O
you H
ever O
see O
anything O
like O
it O
– O
eh O
? O

it O
is O
incredible O
, O
he O
said O
, O
and O
walked O
off O
. O

The O
other O
man H
remained O
. O

He O
was O
a O
first-class O
agent H
, O
young O
, O
gentlemanly O
, O
a O
bit N
reserved O
, O
with O
a O
forked O
little O
beard N
and O
a O
hooked O
nose N
. O

He O
was O
stand-offish O
with O
the O
other O
agents H
, O
and O
they O
on O
their O
side N
said O
he O
was O
the O
manager's O
manager H
's H
spy H
upon O
them O
. O

As O
to O
me H
, O
I H
had O
hardly O
ever O
spoken O
to O
him O
before O
. O

We H
got O
into O
talk O
, O
and O
by-and-by O
we H
strolled O
away O
from O
the O
hissing N
ruins O
. O
Then O
he O
asked O
me H
to O
his O
room N
, O
which O
was O
in O
the O
main O
building N
of O
the O
station N
. O

He O
struck O
a O
match O
, O
and O
I H
perceived O
that O
this O
young O
aristocrat H
had O
not O
only O
a O
silver-mounted O
dressing-case O
but O
also O
a O
whole O
candle N
all O
to O
himself O
. O

Just O
at O
that O
time N
the O
manager H
was O
the O
only O
man H
supposed O
to O
have O
any O
right O
to O
candles N
. O

Native O
mats N
covered O
the O
clay O
walls N
; O
a O
collection N
of O
spears N
, O
assegais N
, O
shields N
, O
knives N
was O
hung O
up O
in O
trophies N
. O

The O
business N
intrusted O
to O
this O
fellow H
was O
the O
making O
of O
bricks N
– O
so O
I H
had O
been O
informed O
; O
but O
there O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
a O
fragment N
of O
a O
brick N
anywhere O
in O
the O
station N
, O
and O
he O
had O
been O
there O
more O
than O
a O
year N
– O
waiting O
. O

It O
seems O
he O
could O
not O
make O
bricks N
without O
something O
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
– O
straw N
maybe O
. O

Anyways O
, O
it O
could O
not O
be O
found O
there O
, O
and O
as O
it O
was O
not O
likely O
to O
be O
sent O
from O
Europe O
, O
it O
did O
not O
appear O
clear N
to O
me H
what O
he O
was O
waiting O
for O
. O

An O
act N
of O
special O
creation N
perhaps O
. O

However O
, O
they O
were O
all O
waiting O
– O
all O
the O
sixteen O
or O
twenty O
pilgrims H
of O
them O
– O
for O
something O
; O
and O
upon O
my H
word N
it O
did O
not O
seem O
an O
uncongenial O
occupation N
, O
from O
the O
way N
they O
took O
it O
, O
though O
the O
only O
thing N
that O
ever O
came O
to O
them O
was O
disease N
– O
as O
far O
as O
I H
could O
see O
. O

They O
beguiled O
the O
time N
by O
backbiting O
and O
intriguing O
against O
each O
other O
in O
a O
foolish O
kind N
of O
way N
. O

There O
was O
an O
air N
of O
plotting O
about O
that O
station N
, O
but O
nothing N
came O
of O
it O
, O
of O
course N
. O

It O
was O
as O
unreal O
as O
everything O
else O
– O
as O
the O
philanthropic O
pretense N
of O
the O
whole O
concern N
, O
as O
their O
talk O
, O
as O
their O
government N
, O
as O
their O
show O
of O
work N
. O

The O
only O
real O
feeling O
was O
a O
desire N
to O
get O
appointed O
to O
a O
trading-post O
where O
ivory N
was O
to O
be O
had O
, O
so O
that O
they O
could O
earn O
percentages N
. O

They O
intrigued O
and O
slandered O
and O
hated O
each O
other O
only O
on O
that O
account O
, O
– O
but O
as O
to O
effectually O
lifting O
a O
little O
finger N
– O
oh O
, O
no O
. O
By O
heavens N
! O

there O
is O
something O
after O
all O
in O
the O
world N
allowing O
one N
man H
to O
steal O
a O
horse A
while O
another O
must O
not O
look O
at O
a O
halter N
. O

Steal O
a O
horse A
straight O
out O
. O
Very O
well O
. O
He O
has O
done O
it O
. O
Perhaps O
he O
can O
ride O
. O

But O
there O
is O
a O
way N
of O
looking O
at O
a O
halter N
that O
would O
provoke O
the O
most O
charitable O
of O
saints A
into O
a O
kick N
. O

From O
this O
standpoint N
, O
the O
evaluation N
of O
the O
implementation N
of O
the O
budget N
may O
take O
on O
a O
dimension N
that O
overrides O
matters N
of O
detail N
. O

Errors O
of O
legality N
and O
regularity N
are O
increasing O
too O
. O

The O
vote N
will O
take O
place N
tomorrow N
at O
12 O
noon N
. O

The O
main O
importance N
of O
this O
agreement N
lies N
, O
I H
think O
, O
in O
its O
political O
nature N
. O

The O
Council N
is O
extremely O
concerned O
at O
the O
latest O
developments N
in O
the O
Middle O
Eastern O
peace N
process N
. O

Otherwise O
we H
will O
find O
ourselves H
forced O
to O
take O
more O
serious O
decisions N
as O
regards O
our H
trading N
relations N
with O
Israel O
. O

Ojala O
recommendation N

reading O
( O
A4-0072/97 O
) O

British O
Conservatives H
also O
believe O
that O
the O
Commission N
is O
wrong O
to O
bring O
forward O
this O
proposal N
in O
the O
name N
of O
the O
European O
Single O
Market N
. O

Within O
the O
European O
Union O
, O
resale N
right O
exists O
in O
the O
legislation N
of O
eleven O
Member N
States O
, O
but O
it O
is O
only O
really O
applied O
in O
eight O
. O

This O
report N
is O
no O
exception N
. O

There O
are O
several O
reasons N
for O
this O
. O

The O
European O
Commission N
maintains O
that O
everything O
depends O
on O
supply N
. O

For O
the O
longer O
term N
, O
the O
preparatory O
mission N
recommended O
economic O
and O
financial O
aid N
to O
Albania O
. O

Greece O
, O
Italy O
, O
France O
, O
Spain O
and O
Austria O
, O
have O
understood O
that O
something O
has O
to O
be O
done O
and O
now O
have O
a O
presence N
in O
Albania O
. O

The O
European O
Union O
is O
not O
a O
military O
organization N
. O

Many O
aspects N
of O
the O
transition N
have O
already O
been O
successfully O
debated O
and O
worked O
out O
, O
for O
example N
continuity N
in O
Kong's O
Kong O
's H
civil O
service N
. O

The O
European O
Union's O
Union O
's H
economic O
interests N
in O
Hong-Kong O
are O
both O
large O
in O
scale N
and O
deep-rooted O
. O

I H
assure O
the O
House O
firmly O
that O
Hong-Kong O
will O
not O
slip N
from O
our H
sights N
in O
the O
Commission N
. O

An O
unsuccessful O
transition N
will O
equally O
damage N
us H
all O
. O

I H
also O
want O
to O
express O
my H
disagreement N
on O
the O
support N
given O
to O
the O
American O
law N
on O
Hong-Kong O
. O

Let O
us H
say O
there O
has O
been O
an O
attempt N
to O
put O
technical O
make-up N
on O
the O
political O
face N
. O

That O
is O
the O
line N
taken O
in O
the O
reports N
before O
you H
today N
. O

We H
know O
that O
the O
refiners H
already O
have O
refineries N
producing O
clean O
diesel N
, O
but O
not O
for O
Europe O
. O
For O
the O
United O
States O
and O
Japan O
. O

It O
is O
precisely O
when O
engines N
are O
claimed O
to O
be O
environment-friendly O
because O
they O
consume O
less O
fuel N
that O
we H
can O
not O
make O
any O
exceptions N
. O

It O
needs N
greater O
definition N
on O
the O
issue N
of O
what O
is O
to O
be O
done O
at O
Community N
level N
in O
terms N
of O
employment N
policy N
. O

Everyone O
knows O
that O
it O
is O
politically O
impossible O
to O
turn O
to O
the O
Member N

ask O
for O
an O
increase O
in O
the O

The O

Subject O
: O

No O
major O

have O
been O
reported O

How O
long O
will O
the O
transitional O
period N
be O
following O
Polish O
accession N
in O
the O
case N
of O
the O
free O
movement N
of O
persons H
? O

This O
procedure N
guarantees N
that O
all O
countries N
applying O
for O
membership N
are O
treated O
equally O
. O

I H
would O
remind O
you H
that O
the O
negotiations N
with O
Spain O
and O
Portugal O
lasted O
seven O
years N
. O

This O
appears O
to O
be O
the O
case N
with O
the O
events N
which O
Mr N
Lomas O
reports N
in O
his O
question N
. O

These O
statements N
are O
widely O
reported O
in O
the O
press N
. O

Even O
civil O
servants H
at O
national O

local O

in O
Britain O
are O
not O
allowed O
to O
get O
involved O
in O
electioneering O
as O
the O

are O
doing O

Do O
you H
not O
think O
some O

not O
all O

was O
Directive N
96/23 O
on O
supervisory O
measures N
for O
implementing O
this O
tougher O
policy N
. O

Subject O
: O
The O
EU O
as O
an O
association N
of O
free O
and O
independent O
States O

If O
I H
understand O
the O
interpreting O
correctly O
it O
seems O
that O
Mr N
Sjöstedt O
himself O
believes O
that O
national O
constitutions N
are O
more O
important O
than O
Community N
law N
. O

Question N
No-15 O
by O
Mr N
Medina H
Ortega O
( O
H-0237/97 O
) O

It O
will O
also O
give O
us H
a O
future N
in O
the O
two O
very O
important O
industries N
that O
we H
can O
not O
ignore O
and O
ensure O
Europe's O
Europe O
's H
future N
prosperity N
. O

Also O
, O
some O
serious O
targets N
must O
now O
finally O
be O
set O
for O
the O
car N
industry N
. O

We H
have O
done O
considerable O
research N
before O
coming O
to O
the O
conclusions N
before O
us H
tonight N
. O

STOA O
, O
to O
produce O
for O
us H
a O
paper N
which O
indicated O
low O
sulphur N
fuels N
are O
essential O
. O

Secondly O
, O
in O
any O
case N
, O
they O
have O
to O
refurbish O
and O
invest O
in O
their O
refineries N
continuously O
. O

The O
rapporteur H
is O
asking O
for O
a O
threshold N
of O
50 O
to O
30 O
ppm O
, O
which O
would O
also O
involve O
excessive O
cost O
without O
appreciable O
benefit N
. O

The O
fiscal O
advantages N
for O
clean O
vehicles N
could O
then O
be O
introduced O
some O
two O
years N
before O
the O
new O
standards N
take O
effect N
. O

It O
emerged O
from O
the O
hearing O
that O
the O
sulphur N
content N
, O
in O
particular O
, O
of O
both O
petrol N
and O
diesel N
could O
be O
much O
lower O
. O

A O
further O
nine O
percent N
can O
be O
eliminated O
over O
the O
next O
eight O
years N
, O
at O
a O
reasonable O
cost O
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
there O
are O
only O
two O
ways N
to O
improve O
air N
quality N
. O

But O
two O
groups N
are O
in O
confrontation N
. O

We H
look O
forward O
to O
what O
the O
Commission N
has O
to O
say O
but O
I H
would O
sound N
a O
note N
of O
warning N
. O

The O
car N
concept N
has O
got O
off O
to O
a O
good O
start O
. O

What O
was O
the O
actual O
driving O
force N
behind O
this O
programme N
? O

We H
will O
change O
this O
programme N
so O
that O
the O
driving O
force N
behind O
it O
is O
the O
future N
and O
innovation N
. O

In O
the O
proposal N
for O
a O
directive N
, O
summer N
begins O
on O
1 O
April O
and O
ends O
on O
30 O
September O
. O

The O
report N
contains O
a O
number N
of O
proposals N
for O
tax N
concessions N
which O
many O
other O
speakers H
have O
mentioned O
in O
this O
evening's O
evening N
's H
debate N
. O

For O
that O
reason N
the O
Commission N
believes O
that O
it O
is O
still O
too O
early O
to O
fix O
limit O
values N
for O
fuel N
quality N
for O
the O
year N
2005 O
. O

These O
are O
Amendments N
Nos N
22 O
, O
23 O
, O
37 O
and O
38 O
. O

The O
Commission N
has O
proposed O
fuel N
specifications N
for O
the O
year N
2000 O
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
there O
has O
clearly O
been O
a O
misunderstanding N
. O

The O
vote N
will O
take O
place N
tomorrow N
at O
12 O
noon N
. O

And O
the O
national O
judges H
frequently O
have O
difficulty N
in O
understanding N
and O
applying O
the O
concept N
of O
indirect O
discrimination N
. O

The O
directive N
codifies O
the O
case N
law N
of O
the O
Court N
of O
Justice H
and O
ensures O
that O
it O
will O
be O
consistently O
applied O
. O

British O
women H
too O
are O
entitled O
to O
the O
same O
treatment N
as O
all O
the O
other O
citizens H
of O
Europe O
. O

She O
has O
already O
spoken O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
and O
other O
colleagues H
will O
be O
doing O
so O
as O
well O
. O

What O
is O
being O
asked O
of O
small O
employers H
here O
is O
very O
difficult O
. O

All O
of O
us H
as O
MEPs O
are O
small O
employers H
too O
. O

in O
order O
to O
bring O
immediate O
results N
it O
will O
also O
be O
necessary O
to O
have O
constant O
monitoring N
of O
the O
implementation N
of O
the O
directive N
. O

The O
problems N
caused O
by O
the O
absence N
of O
transparency N
are O
particularly O
severe O
. O

As O
a O
final O
point N
I H
emphasize O
that O
the O
existing O
positive N
actions N
must O
be O
kept O
in O
place N
. O

Shared O
responsibilities N
, O
both O
at O
work N
and O
in O
the O
family H
mean O
a O
better O
quality N
of O
life N
for O
both O
men H
and O
women H
. O

That O
was O
also O
mentioned O
by O
Mrs N
Oomen-Ruijten O
and O
Mrs N
Glase O
. O

The O
Minutes N
of O
the O
part-session O
of O
Thursday O
29 O
May O
1997 O
have O
been O
distributed O
. O

Why O
do O
I H
raise O
the O
matter N
? O

I H
give O
the O
floor N
to O
Mrs N
Green H
. O

Thursday O
does O
not O
seem O
like O
a O
good O
idea N
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
my H
report N
also O
concerns O
agriculture N
, O
bee-keeping O
to O
be O
precise O
. O

In O
other O
words N
, O
not O
your H
report N
. O

Petitions N
1996-1997 O

Citizens H
take O
their O
right O
to O
petition N
seriously O
. O

Sadly O
my H
report N
is O
not O
all O
plaudits N
. O

I H
wonder O
whether O
they O
are O
in O
the O
debate N
this O
evening N
. O

In O
that O
case N
, O
the O
matter N
turns N
out O
to O
be O
a O
national O
problem N
after O
all O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
when O
the O
matter N
is O
raised O
with O
the O
Committee N
on O
Petitions N
. O

So O
it O
is O
essential O
that O
we H
activate O
this O
right O
fully O
. O

He O
won O
a O
case N
against O
the O
Greek O
railways N
several O
years N
ago O
and O
he O
is O
owed O
several O
thousand O
pounds N
by O
them O
. O

Thank O
you H
very O
much O
, O
Commissioner H
. O

We H
have O
shown O
that O
the O
future N
of O
the O
audio-visual O
industry N
is O
a O
debate N
which O
crosses O
all O
political O
and O
national O
boundaries N
. O

We H
must O
be O
able O
to O
create O
and O
see O
our H
own O
stories N
, O
be O
it O
Inspector O
Morse H
or O
Derrick H
. O

We H
can O
not O
accept O
that O
situation N
. O
The O
first O
reading O
provided O
a O
remedy N
. O

As O
far O
as O
I H
know O
, O
Madam H
President H
, O
lies N
are O
not O
accepted O
in O
any O
parliament N
. O

Copyright N
and O
the O
EU's O
EU O
's H
principle N
of O
free O
competition N
should O
be O
taken O
into O
account O
in O
the O
televising O
of O
sports N
as O
of O
other O
events N
. O

Which O
will O
be O
seen O
and O
which O
not O
? O

Thanks N
to O
all O
this O
it O
will O
now O
be O
more O
difficult O
for O
public O
and O
private O
broadcasters H
to O
ignore O
the O
rules N
contained O
in O
the O
directive N
. O

For O
European O
citizens H
, O
it O
ensures O
that O
the O
public O
interest N
is O
taken O
into O
consideration N
, O
which O
is O
so O
important O
to O
their O
daily O
lives O
. O

Thank O
you H
very O
much O
, O
Commissioner H
. O

Our H
fellow H
citizens H
' O
days N
and O
nights N
are O
becoming O
increasingly O
noisy O
. O

Two O
months N
ago O
I H
had O
to O
have O
an O
operation N
for O
a O
serious O
complaint N
. O

No O
doubt O
much O
of O
what O
our H
citizens H
experience N
as O
noise N
does O
not O
fall N
within O
the O
competence N
of O
the O
Union O
. O

And O
this O
is O
one N
of O
the O
oldest O
pieces N
of O
environmental O
legislation N
that O
we H
have O
in O
Europe O
. O

I H
am O
thinking O
here O
of O
airport N
zones N
, O
high-speed O
trains N
and O
major O
motorways N
. O

This O
refusal N
can O
be O
interpreted O
as O
indirect O
encouragement N
of O
the O
impunity N
and O
immunity N
of O
the O
terrorists H
of O
yesterday N
, O
today N
and O
tomorrow N
. O

Resignation N
of O
a O
Vice-President O

The O
next O
item N
is O
the O
order O
of O
business N
. O

I H
would O
remind O
you H
that O
Mr N
Cornelissen's O
Cornelissen O
's H
report N
has O
been O
added O
to O
the O
agenda N
for O
Tuesday O
. O

I H
hope O
she O
will O
take O
note N
of O
this O
, O
because O
it O
is O
an O
important O
point N
. O

( O
The O
President H
cut O
off O
the O
speaker N
) O

The O
next O
item N
is O
the O
joint O
debate N
on O
the O
following O
statement N
and O
oral O
question N
: O

For O
this O
reason N
, O
the O
initiative N
of O
the O
Commission N
is O
worthy O
of O
our H
congratulations N
. O

My H
group N
, O
the O
Liberal O
group N
, O
is O
presently O
focusing O
its O
attention N
on O
non-European O
Union O
nationals H
. O

They O
are O
no O
longer O
allowed O
to O
practise O
their O
previous O
activities N
as O
doctors H
, O
teachers H
, O
members H
of O
parliament N
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
I H
would O
also O
like O
to O
thank O
Mrs N
Bonino O
wholeheartedly O
for O
her O
work N
on O
behalf N
of O
the O
women H
in O
Kabul O
. O

Barbaric O
violence N
can O
only O
be O
fought O
when O
democracy N
is O
supported O
. O

The O
debate N
is O
closed O
. O

There O
have O
only O
been O
a O
few O
isolated O
amendments N
opposed O
to O
this O
approach N
and O
these O
were O
subsequently O
rejected O
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
my H
group N
supports O
the O
rapporteur's O
rapporteur H
's H
position N
. O

I H
fully O
support N
the O
need O
for O
contacts N
with O
third O
countries N
. O

Secondly O
, O
we H
should O
not O
allow O
this O
to O
be O
postponed O
indefinitely O
, O
and O
we H
should O
not O
introduce O
provisions N
restricted O
to O
physical O
persons H
. O

But O
that O
is O
not O
the O
language N
used O
in O
everyday O
encounters N
with O
the O
bemused O
populations N
of O
the O
EU O
countries N
. O

Two O
approaches O
are O
becoming O
clear N
, O
one N
of O
which O
is O
a O
pragmatic O
approach N
. O

Have O
negotiations N
really O
begun O
? O

Today N
we H
have O
two O
directives N
before O
us H
, O
including O
this O
one N
on O
capital N
income N
. O

Finally O
, O
it O
is O
my H
belief N
that O
it O
is O
not O
for O
us H
to O
deal O
with O
rate N
levels N
. O

I H
believe O
this O
is O
a O
job N
for O
the O
final O
compromise N
round O
of O
Europe's O
Europe O
's H
finance O
ministers H
. O

Where O
coordinating O
tax N
policy N
is O
concerned O
, O
the O
main O
objective N
is O
to O
limit O
manoeuvring O
and O
distortions N
on O
the O
capital N
markets N
. O

My H
country N
is O
one N
of O
them O
. O

Yet O
another O
amendment N
is O
aimed O
at O
simplification N
, O
taking O
references N
to O
the O
tank N
to O
include O
its O
accessories N
as O
a O
matter N
of O
course N
. O

The O
sitting O
was O
suspended O
at O
11.25 O
a.m. O
until O
voting O
time N
at O
11.30 O
a.m. O
. O

Your H
predecessor H
said O
earlier O
– O
we H
only O
finished O
the O
debate N
barely O
twenty O
minutes N
ago O
– O
that O
this O
report N
would O
be O
voted O
on O
tomorrow N
. O

Now O
we H
come O
to O
the O
references N
to O
Macao O
. O

In O
the O
motion N
for O
a O
resolution N
, O
we H
have O
: O

The O
way N
China O
develops O
is O
vital O
for O
the O
way N
our H
own O
societies N
develop O
. O

It O
will O
influence N
not O
only O
our H
economies N
but O
also O
, O
and O
above O
all O
, O
prospects N
for O
democracy N
world-wide O
. O

Directive N
96/96/EC O
established O
the O
principle N
that O
commercial O
road N
vehicles N
must O
undergo O
an O
annual O
roadworthiness N
test N
at O
an O
approved O
testing O
centre N
. O

However O
, O
I H
seriously O
doubt O
that O
the O
introduction N
of O
free O
market N
principles N
, O
which O
the O
report N
so O
enthusiastically O
recommends O
, O
is O
the O
right O
solution N
. O

It O
would O
not O
be O
a O
good O
thing N
to O
blindly O
apply O
competition N
rules N
and O
risk N
endangering O
the O
efficiency N
of O
Community N
and O
national O
interventions N
. O

In O
addition N
, O
the O
Commission N
has O
exclusive O
competence N
in O
matters N
of O
state N
aid N
. O

In O
its O
communication N
, O
the O
Commission N
has O
presented O
some O
proposals N
for O
greater O
consistency N
between O
regional O
policy N
and O
competition N
policy N
in O
the O
EU O
. O

This O
solution N
must O
not O
become O
entrenched O
in O
a O
national-level O
mentality N
. O

The O
Commission N
has O
already O
established O
a O
number N
of O
actions N
to O
help O
them O
. O

It O
concentrates O
on O
combating O
unemployment N
and O
ensuring O
that O
everyone O
has O
a O
job N
. O

No O
one N
is O
left O
out O
; O
there O
are O
clear N
references N
to O
women H
, O
for O
example N
. O

It O
is O
heartening O
that O
the O
European O
Union O
recognises O
the O
problems N
and O
is O
willing O
to O
focus O
on O
them O
. O

Let O
us H
make O
it O
clear N
that O
the O
collection N
of O
clothing N
for O
people N
in O
third O
countries N
who O
need O
it O
can O
continue O
. O

We H
must O
accept O
that O
. O

The O
problem N
is O
that O
in O
many O
EU O
Member N
States O
it O
has O
become O
the O
easy O
option N
with O
dire O
consequences N
for O
the O
environment N
. O

I H
reserve O
my H
right O
to O
come O
back O
on O
this O
when O
it O
goes O
back O
to O
committee N
. O

On O
the O
question N
of O
whether O
to O
exempt O
energy-intensive O
industries N
, O
in O
our H
view N
the O
Commission's O
Commission N
's H
proposal N
has O
advantages N
and O
disadvantages N
. O

The O
international O
exemption N
for O
aircraft N
kerosene N
must O
be O
abolished O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
. O

The O
indexing O
of O
minimum O
rates N
introduced O
by O
Mr N
Cox H
is O
a O
good O
way N
of O
making O
the O
regulation N
simple O
and O
reliable O
. O

As O
a O
result N
, O
the O
legislation N
is O
complex O
, O
hard O
to O
understand O
and O
difficult O
to O
apply O
. O

Standards N
have O
been O
raised O
, O
and O
the O
question N
of O
the O
radio N
ham O
has O
also O
been O
given O
attention N
. O

If O
I H
have O
a O
criticism N
of O
the O
Legal O
Affairs N
Committee's O
Committee N
's H
opinion N
, O
it O
is O
that O
it O
is O
too O
one-sided O
. O

I H
salute O
him O
for O
all O
he O
has O
done O
in O
this O
area N
. O

A O
further O
point N
was O
how O
private O
copying O
should O
be O
regulated O
in O
the O
digital O
environment N
. O

Broad O
sections N
of O
the O
population N
having O
access O
to O
these O
new O
forms N
of O
knowledge N
and O
learning O
is O
something O
we H
should O
very O
much O
welcome O
. O

It O
is O
a O
directive N
which O
safeguards N
the O
interests N
of O
rightholders O
and O
protects O
intellectual O
property N
. O

That O
is O
why O
the O
Socialist H
Group N
will O
be O
supporting O
this O
position N
. O

The O
first O
concerns O
the O
limitations N
on O
copyright N
, O
in O
which O
context N
we H
have O
logically O
proposed O
providing O
compensation N
. O

In O
the O
first O
place N
, O
there O
are O
the O
creators H
. O

There O
are O
no O
clearly O
defined O
rules N
governing O
the O
sharing N
of O
responsibility N
. O

Cultural O
differences N
do O
exist O
, O
and O
so O
I H
do O
not O
understand O
why O
there O
should O
not O
be O
mandatory O
provision N
for O
exemptions N
. O

Some O
time N
ago O
we H
debated O
about O
giving O
the O
rights N
to O
artists H
who O
sell O
their O
artwork N
. O

Since O
that O
legislation N
came O
into O
being O
, O
there O
has O
been O
no O
noticeable O
difference N
. O

There O
is O
a O
proper O
balanced O
way N
to O
achieve O
the O
rights N
that O
everybody O
here O
wants O
to O

What O
is O
most O
needed O
in O
this O
, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
other O
areas N
, O
is O
a O
serious O
in O
depth N
analysis N
of O
the O
problems N
. O

This O
is O
a O
right O
which O
does O
not O
incur O
financial O
consequences N
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
many O
thanks N
to O
Mr N
Barzanti O
. O

We H
are O
told O
we H
must O
balance O
interests N
but O
, O
quite O
frankly O
, O
all O
interests N
are O
not O
equal O
. O

Blank O
screens N
will O
not O
enrich O
our H
society N
. O

Too O
many O
continue O
to O
scrape O
together O
a O
living O
in O
a O
kind N
of O
La O
Bohéme O
garret N
. O

Some O
would O
argue O
that O
there O
should O
be O
fair O
use O
without O
fair O
compensation N
. O

Allow O
the O
creators H
and O
others O
in O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
to O
have O
a O
fair O
debate N
about O
whether O
we H
should O
have O
a O
blank O
tape N
levy O
. O

Copyright N
holders H
are O
given O
an O
absolute O
right O
to O
protection N
, O
with O
the O
banning O
of O
copying O
for O
private O
use O
for O
example N
. O

Let O
us H
be O
honest O
. O

It O
may O
seem O
that O
the O
common O
agricultural O
policy N
or O
the O
trans-European O
transport N
network N
are O
higher O
priorities N
, O
but O
they O
are O
not O
. O

If O
these O
products N
are O
in O
short O
supply N
or O
of O
inferior O
quality N
, O
that O
will O
sound N
the O
death-knell O
for O
Europe O
. O

There O
are O
some O
very O
clear N
examples N
of O
this O
in O
the O
recitals N
. O

The O
ball N
is O
now O
in O
the O
Commission's O
Commission N
's H
court N
. O

At O
one N
time N
, O
almost O
all O
Europe's O
Europe O
's H
major O
hits N
came O
into O
being O
with O
the O
help O
of O
a O
producer N
who O
believed O
in O
them O
. O

We H
feel O
that O
the O
Internet N
provides O
an O
effective O
way N
of O
avoiding O
that O
stranglehold N
. O

The O
information N
society N
is O
in O
fact N
evolving O
in O
a O
global O
context N
. O

I H
am O
well O
aware O
that O
this O
was O
also O
the O
aim N
of O
Parliament's O
Parliament N
's H
work N
. O

We H
can O
not O
, O
however O
, O
accept O
the O
concept N
of O
' O
economic O
significance N
' O
for O
the O
rightholder O
. O

Your H
amendments N
uphold O
two O
important O
principles N
: O
the O
right O
of O
rightholders O
to O
fair O
remuneration N
and O
the O
fine O
distinction N
concerning O
private O
digital O
copies N
. O

The O
first O
principle N
protects O
a O
need O
for O
equity N
; O
it O
is O
a O
measured O
step O
forwards O
in O
the O
quest N
for O
legal O
certainty N
in O
this O
sector N
. O

That O
is O
a O
formula N
which O
allows O
broader O
harmonisation N
and O
respects N
the O
traditions N
and O
practices N
of O
the O
Member N
States O
. O

The O
vote N
will O
be O
taken O
tomorrow N
at O
12 O
noon N
. O

The O
very O
structure N
of O
the O
text N
of O
the O
COM O
in O
wine N
shows N
us H
that O
wine N
is O
an O
agricultural O
product N
rather O
than O
an O
industrial O
product N
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
I H
should O
like O
to O
start O
by O
offering O
my H
sincere O
thanks N
to O
Mr N
Martin H
. O

The O
proposal N
, O
Commissioner H
Fischler O
, O
was O
also O
not O
nearly O
as O
good O
as O
this O
one N
. O

Circumstances N
have O
changed O
in O
some O
respects N
, O
while O
in O
others O
they O
have O
remained O
the O
same O
. O

That O
is O
why O
we H
support N
the O
Agriculture O
Committee's O
Committee N
's H
call O
for O
a O
framework N
regulation N
. O

Each O
area N
has O
its O
own O
way N
of O
making O
wine N
. O

We H
will O
only O
counter N
overproduction N
by O
introducing O
comprehensive O
new O
quality N
criteria N
. O

We H
support N
Mr N
Martin's O
Martin H
's H
report N
and O
we H
say O
one N
thing N
: O
quality N
not O
quantity N
! O

Contrary O
to O
the O
Commission N
proposals N
, O
we H
must O
preserve O
the O
current O
procedure N
known O
as O
the O
Article N
43 O
procedure N
. O

That O
is O
the O
information N
I H
have O
on O
this O
type N
of O
activity N
. O

You H
have O
the O
floor N
, O
Mr N
Van H
Miert O
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
there O
has O
been O
considerable O
progress N
made O
with O
regard N
to O
the O
internal O
market N
for O
medicinal O
products N
. O

It O
will O
be O
borne O
by O
the O
consumers H
and O
will O
constitute O
an O
additional O
element N
of O
the O
price N
of O
electricity N
used O
. O

I H
should O
just O
like O
to O
confirm O
that O
the O
Commissioner H
and O
the O
French O
Minister H
for O
Europe O
are O
both O
agreed O
on O
that O
point N
. O

I H
was O
obviously O
anxious O
to O
hear O
the O
speech N
in O
full O
, O

In O
any O
case N
, O
I H
congratulate O
Mrs N
Thors O
on O
her O
French O
; O
I H
certainly O
can O
not O
speak O
in O
Swedish O
or O
Finnish N
. O

Once O
again O
, O
it O
is O
a O
question N
of O
habit N
. O

This O
also O
applies O
to O
charges N
on O
cross-border O
transfers N
. O

We H
have O
done O
so O
: O
on O
5 O
February O
we H
published O
an O
extremely O
detailed O
press N
release N
dealing O
with O
the O
questions N
you H
have O
raised O
. O

I H
will O
bear O
in O
mind N
however O
, O
as O
these O
debates N
are O
of O
especial O
interest N
to O
me H
, O
that O
Spain O
has O
been O
particularly O
affected O
. O

Question N
No-46 O
by O
Christine H
Oddy O
( O
H-0002/99 O
) O

I H
am O
pleased O
to O
confirm O
that O
the O
Commission N
has O
received O
the O
report N
to O
which O
the O
honourable O
Member N
refers O
. O

Mr N
Hatzidakis O
now O
has O
the O
floor N
for O
one N
minute O
, O
and O
his O
will O
be O
the O
last O
question N
to O
Mr N
van N
den O
Broek O
today N
. O

As O
regards O
the O
negotiations N
, O
you H
know O
the O
Commission's O
Commission N
's H
position N
. O

Question N
No-59 O
by O
Alex H
Smith H
( O
H-0045/99 O
) O

I H
must O
confess O
I H
am O
totally O
surprised O
that O
the O
Commission N
was O
not O
aware O
of O
this O
report N
, O
given O
its O
sensitivity N
at O
this O
particular O
time N
. O

So O
I H
do O
not O
have O
a O
supplementary O
question N
, O
I H
just O
want O
to O
register N
my H
protest N
. O

My H
question N
is O
related O
to O
Mr N
Smith's O
Smith H
's H
question N
. O

It O
has O
always O
failed O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
real O
issue N
, O
namely O
the O
closing-down O
of O
Sellafield O
. O

I H
have O
sat O
here O
patiently O
and O
I H
find O
it O
quite O
extraordinary O
that O
you H
are O
not O
calling O
me H
. O

Instead O
of O
that O
, O
you H
called O
Mr N
Fitzsimons O
as O
a O
supplementary O
to O
Mr N
Smith H
. O

I H
have O
the O
impression N
that O
the O
honourable O
Member N
believes O
the O
public O
invitation N
to O
tender O
in O
connection N
with O
the O
tunnel N
has O
already O
started O
. O

The O
sitting O
was O
suspended O
at O
7.15 O
p.m O
and O
resumed O
at O
9 O
p.m O
. O

Common O
organisation N
of O
the O
market N
in O
wine N
( O
continuation N
) O

I H
also O
think O
that O
the O
Commission's O
Commission N
's H
proposals N
are O
better O
able O
to O
provide O
this O
guarantee N
of O
dynamic O
equilibrium N
. O

This O
also O
means N
that O
in O
several O
areas N
the O
report N
does O
not O
follow O
the O
liberal O
proposals N
made O
by O
the O
Commission N
. O

Everyone O
can O
see O
that O
the O
draft N
CAP O
reforms N
tend O
to O
become O
embedded O
in O
the O
rut N
defined O
by O
the O
Commission's O
Commission N
's H
too O
liberal O
tendencies N
. O

The O
Committee N
on O
Agriculture O
and O
Rural O
Development N
is O
very O
attentive O
to O
the O
demands O
of O
the O
experts H
and O
of O
society N
. O

This O
is O
why O
we H
will O
be O
approving O
the O
report N
which O
has O
been O
presented O
to O
us H
. O

I H
hope O
that O
the O
debate N
on O
wine-growing O
will O
benefit N
the O
wine N
producer N
, O
the O
product N
and O
the O
consumer H
alike O
. O

More O
must O
be O
done O
to O
promote O
the O
product N
on O
the O
international O
markets N
. O

We H
are O
always O
talking O
about O
quality N
; O
well O
, O
I H
believe O
that O
quality N
also O
means N
giving O
priority N
to O
products N
wholly O
derived O
from O
the O
vine A
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
with O
respect N
, O
it O
shows N
an O
enormous O
ignorance N
of O
what O
actually O
happens O
to O
wine N
in O
those O
countries N
that O
it O
is O
shipped O
to O
. O

Ladies H
and O
gentlemen H
from O
both O
North O
and O
South O
, O
we H
must O
vote N
in O
favour N
of O
this O
report N
. O

Commissioner H
Brittan O
should O
know O
this O
. O

The O
appropriate O
forum N
for O
the O
settlement N
of O
this O
dispute N
is O
the O
World N
Trade N
Organisation N
. O

I H
therefore O
urge N
the O
German O
presidency N
to O
take O
whatever O
initiative N
is O
necessary O
in O
the O
Bonn O
EU/US O
summit N
in O
June O
. O

It O
is O
as O
if O
someone H
were O
to O
steal O
my H
wallet N
and O
I H
were O
then O
expected O
to O
sit O
down O
and O
negotiate O
with O
him O
. O

So O
, O
let O
us H
take O
the O
gloves N
off O
. O

We H
shall O
not O
only O
condemn O
them O
. O

It O
affects O
people N
and O
it O
reaches O
them O
at O
different O
times N
and O
on O
different O
issues N
. O

I H
can O
now O
give O
the O
floor N
to O
one N
speaker N
in O
favour N
and O
one N
against O
. O

A O
pirate H
electronic O
version N
is O
available O
but O
not O
in O
French O
. O

In O
addition N
to O
the O
Structural O
Funds N
and O
the O
common O
agricultural O
policy N
, O
the O
financing N
of O
the O
Community N
needs N
to O
undergo O
radical O
reform N
. O

President H
Santer O
rightly O
pointed O
out O
that O
financial O
reform N
is O
one N
of O
the O
main O
pillars N
of O
Agenda N
2000 O
. O

You H
can O
see O
that O
just O
by O
looking O
at O
the O
current O
discussions N
in O
the O
Council N
. O

Work H
that O
one N
out O
if O
you H
can O
! O

At O
the O
same O
time N
that O
one N
truly O
European O
own O
resource N
is O
waning O
rapidly O
in O
its O
importance N
. O

Yet O
, O
the O
good O
old O
traditional O
own O
resources N
are O
the O
cause N
of O
major O
headaches N
for O
control N
and O
concern N
about O
fraud N
. O

We H
have O
a O
system N
of O
own O
resources N
that O
is O
extremely O
complex O
and O
lacking O
in O
transparency N
. O

It O
makes O
life N
very O
difficult O
for O
Members H
, O
Commissioners H
and O
the O
press N
. O

At O
any O
rate N
, O
there O
is O
still O
quite O
a O
lot N
of O
circumvention N
and O
evasion N
in O
this O
area N
by O
the O
Member N
States O
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
I H
should O
also O
like O
to O
compliment O
Mrs N
Haug O
on O
her O
report N
. O

These O
are O
very O
fundamental O
points O
for O
the O
future N
. O

It O
is O
a O
question N
of O
appropriateness N
and O
of O
review N
. O

What O
policies N
and O
at O
what O
level N
? O

Only O
one N
thing N
can O
protect O
us H
from O
this O
unfortunate O
fate N
and O
that O
is O
the O
rule N
of O
unanimity N
. O

I H
should O
like O
to O
welcome O
Mrs N
Cresson O
and O
ask O
her O
to O
reply O
to O
Mr N
Valverde's O
Valverde O
's H
question N
. O

Thank O
you H
very O
much O
. O

The O
premises N
you H
visited O
do O
not O
belong O
to O
the O
European O
Commission N
and O
the O
staff N
you H
met O
are O
not O
employed O
by O
the O
European O
Commission N
. O

I H
am O
unaware O
of O
the O
reasons N
behind O
this O
situation N
you H
describe O
though O
I H
can O
make O
an O
educated O
guess O
at O
them O
. O

Could O
you H
please O
explain O
it O
more O
clearly O
? O

What O
I H
have O
been O
hearing O
about O
the O
representative O
in O
Nicaragua O
is O
indicative O
that O
the O
project N
had O
not O
been O
properly O
closed O
down O
. O

I H
would O
like O
to O
make O
that O
crystal-clear O
. O

I H
am O
referring O
to O
the O
Rio O
Coco O
project N
. O

Mr N
Martin H
, O
please O
reply O
without O
engaging O
in O
a O
dialogue N
, O
as O
the O
Rules N
do O
not O
provide O
for O
one N
. O

Originally O
, O
a O
proposal N
was O
promised O
for O
the O
beginning O
of O
last O
year N
. O

I H
am O
grateful O
to O
the O
honourable O
Member N
for O
his O
question N
. O

I H
just O
hope O
that O
I H
will O
be O
invited O
to O
the O
opening N
ceremony N
because O
we H
worked O
damned O
hard O
to O
get O
it O
. O

Thank O
you H
, O
Mr N
Kinnock O
. O

Question N
No-44 O
by O
Bernie H
Malone H
( O
H-0209/99 O
) O

European O
exports N
rose O
during O
that O
period N
but O
the O
situation N
has O
now O
been O
rectified O
. O

The O
only O
product N
of O
any O
significance N
is O
canned O
tomatoes N
, O
but O
even O
they O
account O
for O
no O
more O
than O
7 O
-% O
of O
the O
market N
. O

For O
my H
part N
, O
I H
feel O
that O
the O
negotiations N
were O
balanced O
and O
that O
they O
open O
the O
way N
for O
achieving O
a O
sustainable O
market N
. O

You H
know O
yourself H
that O
the O
agreement N
with O
South O
Africa O
was O
held O
up O
because O
of O
the O
fisheries N
question N
, O
too O
. O

You H
have O
to O
take O
more O
into O
account O
the O
whole O
question N
of O
, O
not O
just O
giving O
aid N
, O
but O
fair O
trade N
. O

The O
overall O
amount N
was O
6500 O
tonnes N
of O
canned O
tomatoes N
. O

We H
shall O
be O
discussing O
the O
new O
trends N
in O
consumption N
and O
trafficking O
and O
the O
prospects N
for O
the O
future N
. O

Many O
lives O
are O
wasted O
every O
year N
because O
of O
the O
depredations N
of O
the O
people-smugglers O
. O

We H
know O
for O
certain O
that O
those O
who O
try O
to O
reach O
the O
coast N
of O
Europe O
by O
sea N
from O
Morocco O
often O
meet O
a O
grim O
fate N
. O

In O
1996 O
, O
the O
EDU's O
EDU O
's H
mandate N
was O
extended O
to O
include O
the O
smuggling O
of O
human O
beings A
. O

We H
know O
that O
there O
are O
boats N
plying O
between O
Morocco O
and O
Spain O
and O
Gibraltar O
, O
and O
that O
the O
different O
authorities H
concerned O
are O
cooperating O
fully O
. O

What O
do O
you H
think O
are O
the O
target N
routes N
here O
? O

Question N
No-49 O
will O
therefore O
receive O
a O
written O
answer N
. O

We H
are O
closely O
monitoring N
the O
matter N
and O
should O
know O
whether O
the O
regime N
has O
been O
modified O
within O
the O
next O
few O
weeks N
. O

Secondly O
, O
the O
origin N
rules N
applicable O
to O
imports N
to O
third O
countries N
from O
the O
Community N
are O
still O
based O
on O
individual O
Member N
States O
. O

Detailed O
statistics N
on O
EU O
trade N
with O
Cuba O
are O
not O
available O
. O

I H
understand O
from O
sources N
in O
the O
Scottish O
industry N
that O
there O
is O
a O
major O
company N
involved O
in O
Norway O
at O
the O
moment N
. O

As O
I H
have O
said O
, O
84 O
exporters H
have O
had O
the O
undertakings N
replaced O
by O
duties N
instead O
. O

This O
has O
led O
to O
the O
adoption N
of O
a O
common O
position N
on O
Burma O
and O
the O
withdrawal N
of O
GSP O
benefits N
. O

In O
this O
case N
we H
are O
talking O
about O
the O
market N
for O
processed O
meat N
products N
. O

I H
had O
therefore O
been O
hoping O
for O
a O
common O
sense N
reply O
, O
Commissioner H
, O
not O
a O
technical O
one N
. O

The O
directive N
is O
more O
modest O
. O

How O
could O
millions N
of O
customers H
be O
reimbursed O
if O
the O
charge O
had O
already O
been O
included O
in O
their O
electricity N
bills N
? O

Questions N
Nos N
60 O
to O
111 O
will O
therefore O
receive O
written O
answers N
. O

That O
concludes O
Question N
Time N
. O

For O
electoral O
reasons N
and O
in O
order O
to O
appeal O
to O
the O
masses N
, O
the O
subject O
has O
been O
brought O
up O
again O
. O

It O
aims O
at O
the O
heart N
of O
the O
matter N
, O
as O
Agenda N
2000 O
negotiations N
have O
reached O
a O
critical O
stage N
. O

The O
issue N
is O
the O
financing N
of O
EU O
enlargement N
. O

We H
are O
now O
fighting O
over O
who O
is O
going O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
. O

I H
speak O
on O
behalf N
of O
the O
British O
Labour O
Members H
on O
that O
major O
area N
of O
dissent N
. O

At O
the O
moment N
, O
Germany O
has O
a O
massive O
surplus O
in O
its O
balance O
of O
trade N
with O
the O
rest N
of O
the O
Union O
, O
something O
like O
25 O
billion O
. O

Firstly O
, O
does O
the O
total N
amount N
of O
Community N
budget N
receipts N
cover O
the O
current O
requirement N
of O
the O
European O
Union O
? O

How O
much O
further O
do O
you H
want O
it O
to O
fall N
? O

Let O
us H
just O
reflect O
on O
the O
fact N
that O
, O
without O
a O
common O
agricultural O
policy N
, O
there O
would O
be O
no O
European O
Union O
today N
. O

We H
therefore O
had O
to O
meet O
these O
two O
fundamental O
objectives N
and O
I H
sincerely O
believe O
that O
we H
are O
close O
to O
achieving O
this O
. O

Some O
merely O
refer O
to O
purely O
linguistic O
and O
formal O
aspects N
. O

We H
transport N
politicians H
always O
try O
to O
be O
precise O
, O
without O
letting O
things N
get O
out O
of O
hand N
. O

During O
the O
conciliation N
procedure N
the O
Commission N
, O
indeed O
you H
, O
Commissioner H
, O
declared O
that O
a O
proposal N
on O
seaports N
would O
be O
on O
the O
table N
immediately O
. O

There O
are O
two O
other O
points O
I H
would O
like O
to O
address N
. O

Then O
there O
is O
the O
famous O
project N
No-8 O
of O
the O
14 O
very O
important O
projects N
endorsed O
by O
the O
Essen O
summit N
. O

We H
have O
worked O
on O
the O
networks N
too O
long O
for O
this O
to O
happen O
. O

That O
is O
what O
I H
want O
to O
talk O
about O
today N
. O

I H
admit O
that O
, O
Commissioner H
, O
and O
also O
thank O
the O
Commission N
for O
improving O
its O
proposal N
compared O
to O
the O
original O
text N
. O

We H
need O
a O
brief N
report N
summarising O
the O
experience N
gained O
and O
a O
clear N
review N
. O

A O
very O
clear N
and O
accurate O
analysis N
of O
both O
Mediterranean N
and O
non-Mediterranean O
ports N
is O
required O
. O

That O
makes O
sense N
because O
the O
viability N
of O
infrastructure N
investments N
obviously O
depends O
on O
competitive O
revenue-raising O
services N
and O
competitive O
services N
clearly O
need O
quality N
infrastructure N
. O

Amendment N
No-6 O
makes O
more O
radical O
changes N
to O
the O
guideline N
maps N
, O
adding O
new O
links N
and O
creating O
new O
categories N
of O
ports N
. O

All O
I H
would O
regret O
was O
his O
prolonged O
absence N
from O
this O
House O
. O

This O
, O
however O
, O
is O
not O
the O
proposal N
before O
the O
House O
. O

That O
he O
always O
gets O
, O
whether O
he O
likes O
it O
or O
not O
. O

Thank O
you H
, O
Mr N
Kinnock O
. O

There O
is O
much O
talk O
of O
privatisation N
and O
liberalisation N
. O

But O
privatisation N
does O
not O
even O
come O
into O
question N
in O
this O
context N
, O
it O
is O
not O
being O
proposed O
. O

It O
is O
up O
to O
the O
railway N
undertakings N
to O
decide O
whether O
to O
do O
so O
more O
in O
the O
form N
of O
cooperation N
or O
of O
competition N
. O

I H
believe O
the O
Commission N
has O
done O
a O
very O
good O
job N
in O
many O
cases N
. O

Each O
country N
should O
continue O
to O
be O
able O
to O
regulate O
this O
as O
it O
wishes O
in O
its O
area N
of O
jurisdiction N
. O

Personally O
, O
I H
should O
like O
to O
see O
a O
number N
of O
other O
requirements N
deleted O
. O

Consequently O
, O
the O
proposals N
could O
, O
in O
practice O
, O
produce O
the O
opposite N
effect N
to O
that O
intended O
and O
become O
an O
obstacle N
to O
increased O
competition N
. O

Many O
countries N
and O
regions N
are O
worried O
, O
and O
perhaps O
with O
reason N
. O

But O
the O
opportunity N
for O
the O
renaissance N
of O
the O
railways N
is O
at O
hand N
, O
and O
that O
is O
what O
we H
should O
strive O
for O
. O

Compared O
with O
my H
own O
objectives N
, O
I H
do O
not O
think O
the O
demands O
made O
by O
either O
of O
them O
are O
tough O
enough O
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
here O
too O
I H
must O
congratulate O
the O
two O
rapporteurs H
. O

But O
there O
are O
a O
few O
facts N
that O
we H
must O
face N
. O

I H
do O
not O
agree O
with O
him O
at O
all O
. O

How O
can O
we H
license N
individual O
operators H
if O
we H
do O
not O
make O
that O
separation N
? O

Why O
do O
we H
say O
that O
? O

Firstly O
, O
the O
amendment N
of O
the O
concept N
of O
authorised O
applicants H
which O
allows O
any O
natural O
or O
legal O
person H
to O
request N
infrastructure N
capacity N
. O

We H
all O
know O
that O
the O
market N
share O
of O
the O
railways N
has O
declined O
in O
recent O
years N
. O

My H
group N
welcomes O
that O
opportunity N
and O
supports O
the O
Commission N
and O
our H
rapporteurs H
in O
their O
efforts N
to O
secure O
a O
future N
for O
Europe's O
Europe O
's H
railways N
. O

Both O
the O
reports N
before O
us H
today N
represent O
further O
necessary O
steps N
along O
the O
same O
road N
. O

If O
rail N
is O
to O
have O
real O
vitality N
, O
then O
rail N
is O
going O
to O
have O
to O
change O
. O

It O
results N
in O
a O
less O
clear N
definition N
and O
is O
, O
in O
our H
view N
, O
an O
unnecessary O
change O
. O

I H
have O
great O
sympathy N
with O
the O
view N
that O
Community N
legislation N
should O
not O
be O
over-prescriptive O
. O

There O
are O
a O
number N
of O
key N
points O
that O
I H
would O
like O
to O
address N
before O
concluding O
. O

It O
will O
encourage O
them O
to O
place N
greater O
reliance N
on O
this O
mode N
of O
transport N
. O

They O
have O
to O
make O
a O
stronger O
commitment N
to O
rail N
. O

I H
conclude O
by O
thanking O
both O
rapporteurs H
, O

I H
hope O
that O
the O
whole O
House O
will O
endorse O
their O
constructive O
approach N
. O

So O
there O
is O
no O
question N
of O
closing O
down O
, O
there O
is O
a O
question N
of O
the O
practical O
discretion N
of O
the O
committee N
. O

We H
will O
meet O
that O
commitment N
. O

The O
vote N
will O
take O
place N
tomorrow N
at O
12 O
noon N
. O

Perhaps O
it O
is O
especially O
important O
, O
however O
, O
to O
define O
in O
precise O
terms N
the O
responsibility N
that O
city N
will O
have O
to O
assume O
. O

A O
bird A
cried O
out O
on O
the O
roof N
, O
and O
he O
woke O
up O
. O

It O
was O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
afternoon N
, O
in O
the O
heat N
, O
in O
Africa O
; O

he O
knew O
at O
once O
where O
he O
was O
. O

The O
road N
to O
the O
village N
would O
be O
blocked O
, O
the O
dog A
ran O
over O
the O
soft O
fields N
breathing N
like O
a O
dragon A
... O

the O
kernel N
of O
the O
house N
was O
warm O
with O
oil-fired O
heating N
and O
the O
light N
from O
red O
shades N
, O

the O
silky O
colours N
of O
Olivia's O
Olivia H
's H
things N
... O
the O
rugs N
, O
cherry- N
and O
satin-wood O
pieces N
... O
and O
the O
red O
earth N
pots N
, O
bits N
of O
beadwork N
, O
the O
two O
fine O
carvings N
they O
once O
found O
in O
the O
Congo O
. O

A O
few O
days N
ago O
he O
was O
in O
that O
house N
, O
packing N
to O
leave O
in O
the O
flat O
progression N
of O
practical O
matters N
by O
which O
decision N
is O
broken O
up O
into O
reality N
. O

If O
you H
have O
any O
trouble N
with O
the O
boiler N
, O
for O
heaven's O
heaven N
's H
sake N
let O
Mackie O
look O
at O
it O
before O
you H
send O
to O
town N
. O

What O
a O
pity N
you H
gave O
away O
your H
shorts N
. O

There's O
There O
's H
no O
knowing O
if O
I'll O
I H
'll O
be O
anywhere O
where O
I H
could O
dare O
appear O
in O
shorts N
, O
any O
more O
. O

But O
your H
waist N
measurement N
hasn't O
has O
n't O
changed O
by O
so O
much O
as O
half O
an O
inch N
... O

I H
know O
by O
your H
pyjama N
trousers N
, O
I H
use O
exactly O
the O
same O
measurement N
for O
new O
elastic N
as O
I H
always O
did O
. O

Three O
months N
before O
, O
Adamson O
Mweta O
stood O
outside O
a O
steak N
house N
in O
Kensington O
and O
said O
to O
him O
, O

Of O
course N
you'll O
you H
'll O
come O
back O
to O
us H
now O
! O

He O
had O
driven O
home N
, O
slowing N
down O
on O
the O
empty O
road N
that O
led O
through O
the O
fullness N
of O
a O
deserted O
summer N
twilight N
, O
at O
last O
, O
to O
the O
house N
. O

Housing N
estates N
overrun O
villages N
all O
over O
England O
, O
but O
here O
the O
process N
had O
been O
reversed O
; O
the O
house N
had O
once O
been O
a O
manor N
( O
Olivia H
thought O
that O
, O
even O
earlier O
, O
it O
had O
been O
a O
priory N
) O
but O
in O
the O
nineteenth O
century N
the O
village N
was O
depopulated O
by O
the O
drift O
to O
industrialized O
towns N
, O
lost O
its O
autonomy N
, O
and O
died O
; O
the O
shop-cum-post-office O
had O
closed O
, O
the O
cottages N
had O
fallen O
down O
; O

As O
Olivia H
said O
, O
it O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
a O
sad-feeling O
place N
but O
it O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
; O
there O
was O
instead O
a O
renewal N
: O
the O
country N
had O
come O
back O
, O
bringing O
the O
reassurance N
of O
stubborn O
peace N
and O
fecundity N
, O
a O
beginning O
again O
. O

And O
they O
were O
only O
two-hours-and-a-bit O
from O
London O
, O
their O
daughters H
and O
their O
friends H
. O

He O
had O
kept O
up O
, O
since O
he O
finally O
left O
Africa O
ten O
years N
ago O
, O
a O
close O
contact O
with O
Adamson O
Mweta O
and O
the O
other O
leaders H
of O
the O
African O
independence N
movement N
. O

He O
spent O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
time N
going O
back O
and O
forth O
to O
London O
to O
advise O
them O
when O
they O
conferred O
with O
the O
Colonial O
Office O
, O
and O
to O
do O
what O
he O
could O
to O
smooth O
the O
way N
for O
various O
delegations N
that O
came O
to O
petition N
against O
the O
old O
constitution N
and O
to O
negotiate O
independence N
for O
their O
country N
. O

It O
was O
there O
, O
in O
this O
Central O
African O
territory N
, O
that O
he O
had O
been O
a O
colonial O
servant H
until O
the O
settlers H
succeeded O
in O
having O
him O
recalled O
and O
deported O
for O
his O
support N
of O
the O
People's O
People N
's H
Independence O
Party O
. O

He O
said O
to O
his O
wife H
, O
Mweta's O
Mweta O
's H
invited O
me H
to O
come O
back O
as O
their O
guest H
. O

Well O
, O
you H
ought O
to O
be O
at O
the O
Independence O
celebrations N
, O
if O
anyone O
is O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
marvellous O
. O

She O
used O
to O
make O
packages N
of O
sandwiches N
for O
Mweta O
to O
take O
with O
him O
when O
he O
cycled O
for O
miles N
about O
Gala N
province N
at O
weekends N
, O
speaking O
at O
meetings N
. O

He O
said O
to O
Adamson O
Mweta O
before O
they O
parted O
the O
next O
day N
, O
Olivia H
won't O
wo O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
come O
out O
to O
Independence O
, O
unfortunately O
... O
our H
elder H
daughter's O
daughter H
's H
expecting O
a O
child H
just O
round O
about O
that O
time N
. O

Mweta O
said O
, O
with O
his O
slow O
shy O
smile O
that O
always O
seemed O
to O
grow O
like O
a O
light N
becoming O
more O
powerful O
, O
as O
his O
eyes N
held O
you H
, O
You H
mean O
little O
Venetia O
? O

She O
going O
to O
be O
a O
mother H
? O

I'm O
I H
'm O
afraid O
so O
, O
he O
mumbled O
in O
his O
Englishman's O
Englishman H
's H
way N
. O

Well O
, O
that's O
that O
's H
good O
, O
that's O
that O
's H
good O
. O

Never O
mind N
, O
Mrs. O
Bray H
will O
join O
you H
later O
. O

I H
imagine O
by O
the O
time N
she's O
she O
's H
prepared O
to O
trust N
the O
baby H
to O
Venetia O
the O
celebrations'll O
celebrations N
'll O
be O
over O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
what O
I H
mean O
– O

you'll O
you H
'll O
be O
more O
or O
less O
settled O
by O
the O
time N
she O
arrives O
. O

They O
were O
standing N
at O
the O
door N
of O
Mweta's O
Mweta O
's H
taxi N
; O
there O
was O
a O
sudden O
uprush O
of O
feeling O
between O
the O
two O
men H
; O
the O
Englishman H
stood O
there O
, O
the O
small O
, O
quick O
black O
man H
took O
him O
by O
the O
biceps N
, O
hard O
, O
through O
his O
dark O
suit N
, O
as O
in O
his O
own O
country N
he O
would O
have O
linked O
fingers N
with O
a O
brother H
. O

Under O
the O
release N
of O
physical O
contact O
, O
he O
said O
to O
Mweta O
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
we're O
we H
're O
talking O
about O
, O
and O
Mweta O
said O
, O
You H
... O
I H
told O
you H
we H
expect O
you H
back O
, O
now O
. O

But O
what O
would O
I H
do O
? O

What O
use O
should O
I H
be O
to O
you H
? O

He O
was O
so O
accustomed O
to O
effacing O
himself O
in O
the O
hours N
of O
discussion N
of O
constitutional O
law N
and O
political O
tactics N
( O
a O
white O
man H
, O
an O
outsider H
offering O
impersonal O
service N
for O
whatever O
it O
was O
worth N
) O
... O

a O
strong O
consciousness N
of O
his O
own O
being O
flooded O
him O
as O
if O
a O
stimulant N
had O
been O
injected O
into O
his O
veins N
. O

Whatever O
you H
like O
! O

It's O
It O
's H
all O
ours O
! O

We H
need O
you H
; O
whatever O
you H
like O
! O

Mweta O
broke O
away O
and O
jumped O
into O
the O
taxi N
. O

The O
pale O
stone N
façade O
with O
its O
stone N
lintels N
and O
sills N
worn O
smooth O
as O
a O
piece N
of O
used O
soap N
was O
directly O
on O
the O
empty O
road N
but O
the O
real O
face N
of O
the O
house N
was O
the O
other O
side N
. O

Sheltered O
by O
the O
building N
the O
garden N
was O
a O
grassy O
look-out O
over O
fuzzy O
colours N
of O
flowers A
, O
bees A
, O
and O
early O
moths A
to O
the O
long O
valley N
. O

He O
and O
Olivia H
gardened O
on O
summer N
evenings N
, O
not O
seriously O
, O
as O
she O
did O
during O
the O
day N
, O
but O
desultorily O
pulling O
out O
a O
tall O
rank N
weed A
here O
or O
there O
, O
for O
the O
pleasure N
of O
feeling O
its O
roots N
yield N
from O
the O
humus N
and O
bring O
up O
, O
in O
the O
crumbs N
clinging O
to O
that O
beard N
grown O
underground O
, O
a O
smell O
of O
earth N
rich O
as O
fruit-cake O
. O

They O
had O
laid O
flag-stones O
under O
the O
walnut N
trees A
for O
the O
white O
wooden O
chairs N
and O
table N
, O
so O
that O
it O
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
be O
too O
damp O
. O

They O
drank O
whisky N
there O
, O
or O
even O
the O
coffee N
after O
dinner N
. O

Sometimes O
before O
the O
dusk N
wavered O
the O
wood N
away O
into O
the O
distance N
, O
he O
went O
out O
into O
the O
sunlight N
that O
collected O
like O
golden O
water N
in O
the O
dip N
of O
the O
meadows N
and O
shot N
a O
partridge N
. O

There O
was O
no O
one N
to O
bother O
about O
shooting N
rights N
. O

Afterwards O
as O
the O
evening N
faded O
he O
cleaned O
the O
gun N
almost O
by O
feel O
and O
the O
clean O
, O
practical O
smell O
of O
gun-oil O
conveyed O
the O
simple O
satisfaction N
of O
the O
task N
. O

Olivia H
played O
records N
with O
the O
living-room N
windows N
wide O
open O
so O
that O
the O
music N
came O
out O
to O
them O
. O

This O
summer N
it O
was O
Stravinsky O
and O
Poulenc O
; O

she O
was O
of O
the O
generation N
and O
class N
that O
paid O
other O
women H
to O
knit O
and O
now O
that O
she O
herself O
was O
about O
to O
be O
a O
grandmother H
she O
made O
funny O
stuffed O
toys N
for O
nieces H
and O
nephews H
. O

She O
had O
a O
cigar N
box N
full O
of O
odd O
buttons N
, O
as O
a O
supply N
of O
eyes N
, O
but O
she O
put O
it O
away O
from O
her O
because O
one N
of O
the O
things N
she O
had O
hated O
when O
she O
was O
young O
was O
the O
show O
of O
dissembling O
older O
women H
made O
when O
confronted O
with O
something O
vital O
to O
them O
. O

I H
suppose O
we H
said O
many O
times N
we'd O
we H
'd O
come O
back O
when O
they O
got O
their O
independence N
. O

She O
gave O
a O
small O
, O
self-questioning O
shrug N
, O
admitting O
the O
glibness N
of O
another O
kind N
of O
daily O
talk O
in O
another O
time N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
not O
because O
of O
what O
one N
said O
. O

But O
both O
knew O
that O
, O
in O
those O
days N
, O
the O
important O
thing N
was O
to O
give O
Adamson O
Mweta O
faith N
in O
himself O
by O
positing N
a O
future N
that O
was O
real O
because O
you H
, O
a O
white O
person H
with O
nothing N
personal O
to O
gain O
by O
it O
, O
showed O
you H
believed O
it O
would O
come O
about O
. O

Gazing O
out O
across O
the O
valley N
and O
then O
calmly O
at O
him O
, O
she O
had O
her O
look O
of O
wanting O
to O
find O
out O
exactly O
what O
they O
were O
talking O
about O
. O

He O
said O
, O
Certainly O
I H
thought O
of O
going O
back O
, O
then O
. O
Before O
we H
left O
. O

Just O
as O
I H
knew O
we H
should O
have O
to O
leave O
. O

Poor O
Adamson O
, O
it O
looked O
pretty O
hopeless O
at O
times N
. O

And O
yet O
it's O
it O
's H
come O
so O
quickly O
. O

Ten O
years N
. O

Ten O
years N
since O
they O
had O
been O
deported O
from O
the O
territory N
, O
ten O
years N
since O
she O
was O
a O
youngish O
woman H
of O
forty O
, O
and O
the O
girls H
were O
still O
schoolgirls H
. O

Historically O
, O
yes O
, O
it O
would O
happen O
but O
not O
to O
Adamson O
, O
and O
not O
to O
us H
? O

The O
house N
they O
had O
bought O
, O
filled O
with O
possessions N
that O
had O
been O
stored O
all O
the O
years N
they O
were O
in O
Africa O
, O
the O
garden N
they O
had O
made O
, O
spoke O
for O
them O
. O

It O
was O
not O
a O
house N
to O
be O
quitted O
. O

They O
expect O
you H
back O
, O
she O
said O
with O
pride N
. O

Adamson O
was O
in O
the O
flush O
of O
victory N
, O
all O
right O
. O

I H
think O
he'd O
he O
'd O
have O
embraced O
Henry H
Davis H
. O

Davis H
was O
the O
settler H
M.P. H
who O
had O
been O
responsible O
, O
at O
one N
stage N
, O
for O
getting O
Mweta O
banished O
to O
the O
far O
Western O
Province O
. O

He O
naturally O
assumes O
you'll O
you H
'll O
come O
out O
of O
exile H
. O

They O
laughed O
. O

But O
they O
were O
talking O
of O
Mweta O
; O

the O
strange O
shyness N
of O
twenty-two O
years N
of O
marriage N
made O
it O
impossible O
for O
her O
to O
say O
: O
Do O
you H
want O
to O
go O
? O

The O
passionate O
beginning O
, O
the O
long O
openness N
and O
understanding N
between O
them O
should O
have O
meant O
that O
she O
would O
know O
what O
he O
wanted O
. O

And O
in O
a O
way N
she O
did O
know O
: O
because O
it O
was O
for O
them O
a O
code N
so O
deeply O
accepted O
that O
it O
had O
never O
been O
discussed O
... O

one N
was O
available O
wherever O
one N
was O
of O
use O
. O

What O
else O
was O
there O
to O
live O
by O
? O

And O
so O
the O
question N
of O
what O
they O
were O
talking O
about O
really O
amounted O
to O
her O
hidden O
, O
pressed-down O
, O
banked-over O
desire N
to O
know O
whether O
this O
house N
, O
this O
life N
in O
Wiltshire O
, O
this O
life N
– O
at O
last O
– O
seemed O
to O
him O
the O
definitive O
one N
, O
in O
the O
end N
. O

Because O
she O
was O
suddenly O
realizing O
that O
it O
had O
been O
so O
for O
her O
. O

She O
was O
, O
after O
all O
( O
in O
the O
true O
sense N
of O
after O
all O
that O
had O
gone O
before O
) O
an O
Englishwoman H
. O

She O
had O
taken O
out O
of O
storage N
the O
furniture N
and O
family H
possessions N
that O
had O
been O
nothing N
but O
a O
nuisance N
to O
her O
when O
they O
left O
England O
together O
twenty O
years N
ago O
, O
and O
, O
putting O
them O
in O
place N
, O
inevitably O
had O
accepted O
the O
life N
the O
arrangement N
of O
such O
objects N
provided O
for O
, O
and O
her O
comfortable O
private O
income N
made O
possible O
. O

In O
the O
room N
they O
had O
decided O
upon O
for O
his O
study O
, O
the O
desk N
from O
her O
great-grandfather O
that O
had O
naturally O
become O
his O
– O
a O
quiet N
field N
of O
black-red O
morocco N
scratched O
with O
almost O
erased O
gold N
– O
was O
a O
place N
to O
write O
the O
properly O
documented O
history N
of O
the O
territory N
( O
Mweta's O
Mweta O
's H
country N
) O
that O
had O
never O
been O
done O
before O
; O
not O
the O
boxwood N
Colonial O
Office O
desk N
at O
which O
one N
dealt O
with O
government N
forms N
and O
made O
the O
empirical O
scribbles N
of O
administration N
or O
politics N
. O

In O
the O
scented O
, O
mothy O
evening N
she O
felt N
the O
presence N
of O
the O
house N
like O
someone H
standing N
behind O
her O
. O

She O
did O
not O
know O
whether O
he O
felt N
it O
too O
; O
and O
she O
could O
not O
try O
to O
find O
out O
because O
if O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
he O
didn't O
did O
n't O
– O
she O
had O
a O
premonition N
, O
sometimes O
, O
that O
in O
middle O
age N
you H
could O
find O
you H
had O
lost O
everything O
in O
a O
moment N
: O
husband H
– O
lover H
, O
friend H
, O
children H
, O
it O
was O
as O
if O
they O
had O
never O
happened O
, O
or O
you H
had O
wandered O
off O
from O
them O
without O
knowing O
, O
and O
now O
stood O
stock-still O
with O
the O
discovery N
. O

They O
watched O
the O
moths A
in O
the O
tobacco N
flowers A
. O

She O
said O
in O
her O
sensible O
, O
inquiring O
, O
Englishwoman's O
Englishwoman H
's H
voice H
behind O
which O
generations A
of O
her O
kind N
had O
sheltered O
, O
Did O
Mweta O
say O
how O
long O
? O

It O
was O
very O
much O
a O
gesture N
! O

No O
, O
but O
he'd O
he O
'd O
already O
mentioned O
it O
yesterday N
, O
isn't O
is O
n't O
that O
so O
? O

You H
misunderstood O
him O
yesterday N
. O

A O
year N
? O
Six O
months N
? O
... O
What O
? O

White O
people N
given O
appointments N
in O
African O
countries N
after O
independence N
were O
usually O
employed O
on O
contract N
. O

Good O
Lord A
, O
I've O
I H
've O
no O
idea N
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
sure O
he O
hasn't O
has O
n't O
either O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
all O
in O
the O
air N
. O

Olivia H
went O
in O
to O
change O
the O
record N
and O
because O
it O
was O
, O
unexpectedly O
, O
Mozart H
– O
the O
harp N
and O
Mute N
concerto N
– O
he O
lit O
a O
cigar N
to O
smoke O
while O
he O
enjoyed O
it O
. O

She O
wandered O
down O
to O
the O
herb N
garden N
and O
brought O
back O
a O
branch N
of O
dill A
; O

There O
he O
is O
, O
she O
said O
. O

It O
was O
their O
owl A
, O
a O
youngster H
who O
had O
hatched O
out O
down O
in O
the O
field N
and O
was O
heard O
every O
night N
. O

She O
remarked O
that O
tomorrow N
she O
must O
pick O
the O
dill A
for O
drying O
. O

Everything O
was O
just O
as O
it O
was O
. O

But O
everything O
was O
changed O
. O

All O
had O
turned O
over O
in O
the O
barrel N
of O
the O
world N
and O
steadied O
itself O
again O
. O

She O
knew O
, O
if O
he O
didn't O
did O
n't O
, O
that O
he O
was O
going O
. O

It O
was O
night N
in O
Europe O
all O
the O
way N
. O

Dark O
rain N
in O
the O
afternoon N
in O
London O
when O
the O
plane N
took O
off O
, O
at O
Rome O
the O
airport N
a O
vast O
, O
bleary O
shopwindow N
shining O
blurred O
colours N
through O
rain N
. O

He O
hauled O
down O
his O
coat N
again O
to O
get O
out O
at O
Athens O
. O

The O
metal O
rail N
of O
the O
steps N
wheeled O
against O
the O
plane N
was O
icy-wet O
to O
his O
palm A
and O
in O
the O
streaming O
rain N
he O
did O
not O
smell O
the O
Aegean O
or O
thyme A
, O
as O
he O
had O
remembered O
from O
other O
journeys N
to O
Africa O
. O

Inside O
the O
airport N
under O
the O
yellow O
light N
the O
passengers H
sat O
down O
again O
on O
exhausted-looking O
chairs N
, O
bundled O
deep O
in O
their O
heavy O
clothing N
. O

An O
old O
woman H
with O
crinkly O
grey O
hair N
woke O
up O
at O
her O
post N
outside O
the O
lavatory N
and O
opened O
the O
door N
, O
smiling O
and O
grasping O
a O
filthy O
cleaning N
rag N
. O

He O
walked O
around O
to O
ease N
the O
cramp N
in O
his O
knees N
but O
there O
was O
a O
small O
circumference N
and O
within O
a O
few O
strides N
one N
found O
oneself O
back O
again O
at O
the O
shop N
, O
before O
which O
women H
and O
child H
passengers H
were O
drawn O
to O
gaze O
at O
embroidered O
aprons N
and O
evzone O
dolls N
. O

A O
girl H
of O
ten O
or O
eleven O
with O
the O
badges N
of O
the O
cantons N
of O
Switzerland O
sewn O
to O
the O
sleeve N
of O
her O
coat N
had O
exactly O
the O
look O
of O
Venetia O
at O
that O
age N
. O

He O
bought O
a O
postcard N
of O
brilliant O
blue O
sea N
and O
dazzling O
white O
ruins O
and O
tried O
to O
write O
, O
in O
what O
he O
could O
remember O
of O
Greek O
: O

Winter N
and O
darkness N
here O
but O
in O
Cambridge O
, O
perhaps O
, O
there's O
there O
's H
already O
spring N
yelling N
its O
head N
off O
? O

My H
love O
to O
you H
, O
James H
. O

Venetia O
had O
had O
a O
first O
in O
Greek O
, O
herself O
, O
only O
a O
year N
ago O
, O
and O
could O
laugh O
over O
the O
mistakes N
. O

But O
that O
was O
the O
end N
of O
Europe O
. O

At O
Kano O
a O
huge O
moon N
shone O
and O
in O
a O
light N
brighter O
than O
a O
European O
winter N
afternoon N
the O
passengers H
made O
their O
way N
across O
the O
tarmac N
at O
three O
in O
the O
morning N
against O
the O
resistance N
of O
a O
heat N
of O
the O
day N
persisting O
all O
through O
the O
night N
as O
the O
sun N
persists O
in O
a O
stone N
it O
has O
warmed O
. O

There O
was O
a O
smell O
of O
woodsmoke O
; O

the O
men H
moving O
about O
beneath O
the O
belly N
of O
the O
plane N
had O
bare O
black O
feet N
. O

When O
the O
passengers H
climbed O
aboard O
again O
, O
their O
clothes N
felt N
hairy O
and O
the O
plane N
was O
airless O
. O

He O
put O
the O
coat N
away O
on O
the O
rack N
, O
apologizing O
, O
trying O
not O
to O
hamper O
other O
people N
in O
the O
general O
move O
to O
rearrange O
gear N
; O
the O
anticipation N
of O
arrival H
, O
still O
some O
hours N
off O
, O
aroused O
in O
them O
not O
so O
much O
common O
purpose N
as O
a O
spread O
of O
instinct N
as O
in O
the O
lifted O
heads N
of O
a O
herd O
become O
aware O
of O
the O
promise N
of O
water N
. O

When O
the O
sun N
rose O
some O
slumped O
off O
into O
sleep O
, O
but O
women H
began O
to O
examine O
the O
plastic N
bags N
in O
which O
they O
kept O
their O
hats N
, O
and O
, O
as O
the O
hard O
beams N
of O
the O
sun N
struck O
into O
the O
cabin N
on O
hairnets N
, O
pale O
lips N
, O
and O
stubble N
, O
queues N
formed O
for O
the O
lavatories N
. O

While O
he O
was O
writing N
on O
the O
customs N
and O
immigration N
form N
, O
BRAY O
, O
Evelyn H
James H
, O
and O
the O
number N
of O
his O
passport N
, O
someone H
was O
reading O
his O
name N
over O
his O
shoulder N
; O
he O
flexed O
it O
awkwardly O
, O
not O
because O
he O
minded O
, O
but O
in O
mild O
embarrassment N
. O

The O
queue N
for O
the O
lavatory N
moved O
along O
a O
notch N
, O
he O
glanced O
up O
and O
the O
man H
, O
carrying O
a O
flowered O
sponge-bag O
, O
caught O
his O
eye N
with O
a O
tired O
vacant O
stare O
that O
changed O
to O
an O
expression N
of O
greeting N
. O

The O
woman H
who O
had O
dozed O
beside O
him O
all O
night N
communicating O
the O
intimate O
rhythm N
of O
her O
breathing N
but O
never O
exchanging O
a O
word N
, O
suddenly O
began O
to O
talk O
like O
a O
bird A
who O
has O
the O
cover O
taken O
off O
its O
cage N
. O

He O
wedged O
himself O
between O
the O
seats N
to O
recover O
the O
shoe N
she O
had O
lost O
somewhere O
over O
a O
distant O
desert N
; O

she O
laughed O
, O
protested O
apologetically O
, O
and O
shook O
cologne N
down O
into O
her O
freckled O
bosom N
. O

Dragging O
back O
the O
little O
curtain N
from O
the O
oval O
window N
, O
she O
looked O
into O
the O
dazzling O
glare N
of O
space N
and O
said O
, O
Glorious O
morning N
up O
here O
! O
and O
they O
discussed O
with O
animation N
the O
cold O
and O
sudden O
winter N
that O
was O
left O
behind O
. O

As O
he O
did O
not O
have O
a O
window N
seat N
he O
did O
not O
see O
the O
bush N
and O
the O
earth N
red O
as O
brick-dust O
and O
the O
furze A
of O
growth N
along O
the O
river-beds O
: O

not O
until O
the O
plane N
had O
come O
to O
a O
stop N
on O
the O
runway N
, O
and O
they O
were O
waiting O
for O
the O
health N
inspector H
to O
come O
aboard O
. O

He O
unhooked O
his O
safety N
belt N
and O
leaned O
over O
to O
look O
at O
an O
angle N
through O
the O
bleary O
lens N
on O
the O
far O
side N
of O
the O
aisle N
; O
and O
there O
it O
was O
, O
tiny O
and O
distorted O
and O
real O
, O
bush N
, O
earth N
, O
exactly O
as O
it O
remained O
in O
his O
mind N
always O
, O
without O
his O
thinking O
about O
it O
. O

It O
was O
underfoot O
. O

It O
was O
around O

A O
black O
man H
in O
khaki O
shorts N
( O
used O
to O
be O
a O
white O
man H
in O
white O
stockings N
) O
sprayed O
a O
cloyingly O
perfumed O
insecticide N
over O
the O
passengers H
' O
heads N
as O
a O
precaution N
against O
the O
plane N
harbouring O
mosquitoes A
and O
tsetse A
flies O
. O

The O
doors N
opened O
; O
voices N
from O
without O
came O
in O
on O
currents N
of O
air N
; O
he O
emerged O
among O
the O
others O
into O
heady O
recognition N
taken O
in O
at O
all O
the O
senses N
, O
walking O
steadily O
across O
the O
tarmac N
through O
the O
raw-potato O
whiff N
of O
the O
undergrowth N
, O
the O
fresh O
, O
early O
warmth N
on O
hands N
, O
the O
cool O
metallic O
taste N
of O
last O
night's O
night N
's H
storm N
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
throat N
, O

The O
disembarking O
passengers H
were O
all O
strangers H
again O
, O
connected O
not O
with O
each O
other O
but O
to O
the O
mouthing O
, O
smiling O
faces N
and O
waving O
hands N
on O
the O
airport N
balcony N
. O

He O
knew O
no O
one N
but O
the O
walk O
was O
processional O
, O
a O
reception N
to O
him O
, O
and O
by O
the O
time N
he O
entered O
the O
building N
over O
the O
steps N
where O
, O
as O
always O
, O
dead O
insects A
fallen O
from O
the O
light N
during O
the O
night N
had O
not O
been O
swept O
away O
, O
it O
was O
all O
as O
suddenly O
familiar O
and O
ordinary O
as O
the O
faces N
other O
people N
were O
greeting N
were O
, O
to O
them O
. O

Waiting O
to O
be O
summoned O
to O
the O
customs N
officers H
' O
booths N
, O
the O
companions H
of O
the O
journey N
ignored O
each O
other O
. O

Only O
the O
man H
with O
the O
flowered O
sponge-bag O
, O
as O
if O
unaware O
of O
this O
useful O
convention N
, O
insisted O
on O
a O
Here O
we H
are O
again O
smile O
. O

You're O
You H
're O
Colonel O
Bray H
? O

He O
spoke O
round O
the O
obstacle N
of O
a O
woman H
standing N
between O
them O
. O

Thought O
I H
recognized O
you H
in O
Rome O
. O

Welcome O
back O
. O

I H
must O
confess O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
remember O
you H
. O

I've O
I H
've O
been O
away O
a O
long O
time N
. O

The O
man H
had O
long O
coarse O
strands N
of O
sun-yellowed O
hair N
spread O
from O
ear N
to O
ear N
across O
a O
bald O
head N
and O
wore O
sunglasses N
that O
rested O
on O
fine O
Nordic O
cheekbones N
. O

I've O
I H
've O
only O
just O
come O
to O
live O
here O
... O
from O
down O
South O
. O
South O
Africa O
. O

Who O
was O
that O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
... O
one N
of O
the O
people N
from O
the O
plane N
... O
a O
baldish O
fair O
man H
with O
an O
accent O
, O
I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
catch O
the O
name N
. O

He'd O
He O
'd O
recently O
moved O
up O
here O
. O

Oh O
Hjalmar O
Wentz O
must O
have O
been O
. O

He O
and O
his O
wife H
took O
over O
the O
Silver O
Rhino O
last O
year N
. O

I H
like O
old O
Hjalmar O
. O

He's O
He O
's H
just O
been O
to O
Denmark O
or O
somewhere O
because O
his O
mother H
died O
. O

We'll O
We H
'll O
go O
in O
and O
have O
a O
steak N
there O
one N
evening N
, O
they're O
they O
're O
trying O
to O
make O
a O
go O
of O
it O
with O
a O
charcoal O
grill N
and O
whatnot N
. O

What O
happened O
to O
McGowan O
? O

Good O
God H
, O
they've O
they O
've O
been O
gone O
at O
least O
five O
or O
six O
years N
. O

There've O
There O
've O
been O
three O
other O
managers H
since O
then O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
difficult O
to O
do O
anything O
with O
that O
place N
now O
; O

it's O
it O
's H
got O
the O
character A
of O
the O
miners H
' O
pub N
it O
was O
, O
but O
it's O
it O
's H
very O
handy O
for O
the O
new O
government N
offices N
, O
not O
too O
overawing O
, O
so O
you H
get O
quite O
a O
few O
Africans H
coming O
in O
. O

A O
genteel O
lot N
, O
very O
conscious O
of O
their O
dignity N
, O
man-about-town H
and O
all O
that O
, O
you H
can O
imagine O
how O
the O
white O
toughies H
feel O
about O
all O
those O
white O
collars N
round O
black O
necks N
in O
the O
bar N
. O

Hjalmar's O
Hjalmar O
's H
as O
gentle O
as O
a O
lamb A
and O
he O
has O
to O
keep O
the O
peace N
somehow O
. O

Oh O
I'll O
I H
'll O
tell O
you H
who's O
who O
's H
still O
around O
though O
– O
Barry H
Forsyth O
. O

Yes O
, O
and O
making O
money N
. O

Forsyth O
Construction N
. O
You'll O
You H
'll O
see O
the O
board N
everywhere O
. O

They O
tell O
me H
he's O
he O
's H
got O
the O
contract N
for O
the O
whole O
Isoza O
River N
reclamation N
scheme N
... O
employs O
engineers H
from O
Poland O
and O
Italy O

Because O
of O
the O
mosquitoes A
, O
they O
moved O
into O
the O
house N
. O

The O
spiders A
came O
out O
from O
behind O
the O
pictures N
and O
flattened O
like O
starfish A
against O
the O
walls N
. O

There O
was O
no O
air N
at O
all O
in O
the O
living-room N
, O
and O
a O
strong O
smell O
of O
hot O
fat O
. O

Every O
now O
and O
then O
, O
while O
dinner N
was O
awaited O
, O
their O
conversation N
was O
backed O
by O
intensely O
sociable O
sounds N
– O
pitched O
talk O
– O
let O
in O
from O
the O
kitchen N
as O
the O
servant H
went O
in O
and O
out O
, O
laying N
the O
table N
. O

There O
was O
another O
large O
meal N
, O
and O
an O
exchange O
about O
a O
bottle N
of O
white O
wine N
between O
Dando O
and O
his O
cook O
, O
Festus O
. O

Of O
course N
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
open O
wrong O
kind N
bottle N
. O

I H
know O
when O
is O
eat-e O
chicken N
, O
I H
know O
when O
is O
eat-e O
beef N
. O

Well O
it O
is O
the O
wrong O
one N
, O
because O
I H
told O
you H
this O
morning N
I H
wanted O
the O
round O
flat O
bottle N
put O
in O
the O
fridge N
. O

You H
say O
I H
cook O
chicken N
, O
isn't O
is O
n't O
it O
? O

I H
look O
, O
I H
see O
the O
round O
bottle N
is O
red O
wine N
inside O
... O

It's O
It O
's H
pink O
. O

I H
specially O
didn't O
did O
n't O
say O
anything O
about O
the O
colour N
because O
I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
muddle O
you H
up O
. O

I H
know O
how O
obstinate O
you H
are O
, O
Festus O
... O

They O
argued O
self-righteously O
as O
two O
old-maid O
sisters H
. O

Festus O
could O
be O
heard O
retailing O
the O
exchange O
, O
confidently O
in O
the O
right O
, O
in O
the O
kitchen N
; O

Dando O
, O
equally O
assured O
, O
went O
on O
talking O
as O
if O
without O
interruption N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
not O
an O
exaggeration N
to O
say O
that O
what O
they're O
they O
're O
having O
to O
do O
is O
introduce O
a O
so-called O
democratic O
social O
system N
in O
place N
of O
a O
paternalist O
discipline O
. O

You H
haven't O
have O
n't O
replaced O
the O
District O
Commissioner H
by O
appointing O
a O
district N
magistrate H
. O

You've O
You H
've O
only O
replaced O
one N
of O
his O
functions N
. O

You've O
You H
've O
still O
got O
to O
get O
country N
people N
to O
realize O
that O
these O
functions N
are O
now O
distributed O
among O
various O
agencies N
: O

it's O
it O
's H
no O
good O
running O
to O
the O
magistrate H
if O
someone H
needs N
an O
ambulance N
to O
take O
him O
to O
the O
next O
town N
, O
for O
instance N
... O

In O
bush N
stations N
there O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
anything O
we H
weren't O
were O
n't O
responsible O
for O
. O

Exactly O
. O

But O
now O
people N
have O
to O
learn O
that O
there's O
there O
's H
a O
Department O
of O
Public O
Health N
to O
go O
to O
. O

A O
good O
thing N
! O

A O
good O
thing N
for O
everybody O
! O

What O
a O
hopeless O
business N
it O
was O
, O
hopeless O
for O
the O
D.C. O
and O
for O
the O
people N
. O

Dependency N
and O
resentment N
hand N
in O
hand N
. O

Whatever O
the O
black O
magistrates H
are O
like O
, O
whatever O
the O
administration's O
administration N
's H
like O
, O
it O
won't O
wo O
n't O
be O
like O
that O
. O

The O
magistrates H
are O
all O
right O
, O
don't O
do O
n't O
you H
worry O
. O

A O
damned O
sight N
better O
than O
some O
of O
our H
fellows H
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
worried O
at O
that O
level N
. O

The O
Bench N
doesn't O
does O
n't O
change O
of O
course N
. O

Bray H
laughed O
at O
Dando's O
Dando O
's H
expression N
; O

the O
look O
of O
weary O
, O
bottomless O
distaste N
in O
the O
wrinkled O
mugs N
of O
certain O
breeds A
of O
dogs A
. O

They'll O
They O
'll O
die O
off O
, O
I H
suppose O
. O

There's O
There O
's H
that O
to O
be O
said O
for O
it O
. O

But O
God H
knows O
what O
we'll O
we H
'll O
get O
then O
. O

I H
met O
Gwenzi's O
Gwenzi O
's H
brother H
in O
London O
one N
day N
while O
he O
was O
at O
Gray's O
Gray O
's H
Inn N
; O

he O
told O
me H
he O
was O
going O
to O
be O
the O
first O
African O
at O
the O
bar N
here O
. O

When O
Dando's O
Dando O
's H
opinion N
of O
someone H
was O
really O
low O
he O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
hear O
his O
name N
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
think O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
I've O
I H
've O
got O
some O
bad O
times N
coming O
to O
me H
, O
he O
said O
, O
as O
if O
taking O
up O
, O
in O
private O
, O
current O
talk O
about O
himself O
. O

When O
I H
said O
yes O
to O
Mweta O
I H
knew O
it O
and O
every O
time N
I H
walk O
past N
the O
title N
on O
my H
office N
door N
I H
know O
it O
. O

The O
day N
will O
come O
when O
I'll O
I H
'll O
have O
deportation N
orders N
to O
sign N
that O
I H
won't O
wo O
n't O
want O
to O
sign N
. O

Warrants N
of O
arrest N
. O
Or O
worse O
. O

He O
ate O
a O
mouthful N
of O
the O
left-over O
granadilla A
pudding N
, O
and O
there O
was O
the O
smallest O
tremor N
, O
passing O
for O
a O
moment N
through O
his O
head N
. O

Poor O
old O
Dando O
. O

Anyone O
who's O
who O
's H
stayed O
on O
is O
a O
fool H
if O
he O
hasn't O
has O
n't O
thought O
about O
that O
, O
said O
Bray H
. O

And O
I'll O
I H
'll O
be O
instructing O
the O
State N
Prosecutor H
to O
act N
when O
I'd O
I H
'd O
rather O
not O
, O
too O
. O

That O
I H
can O
count O
on O
. O

What O
if O
Shinza O
should O
make O
a O
bit N
of O
trouble N
at O
the O
next O
elections N
, O
what O
if O
he O
were O
to O
feel O
himself O
bloody O
well O
discounted O
as O
he O
certainly O
is O
, O
and O
start O
up O
a O
real O
opposition N
with O
all O
the O
tricks N
that O
he O
taught O
PIP O
, O
eh O
? O

What O
if O
he O
brought O
the O
whole O
Lambala-speaking O
crowd N
out O
in O
a O
boycott N
, O
with O
all O
the O
old O
beatingsup N
at O
the O
polls N
, O
hut N
burnings N
– O
you H
think O
I H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
find O
myself H
the O
one N
to O
put O
Shinza O
inside O
, O
this O
time N
? O

Well O
, O
I H
know O
. O

But O
why O
on O
earth N
should O
it O
come O
to O
that O
? O

I H
knew O
it O
when O
I H
said O
yes O
to O
Mweta O
. O

Poor O
bloody O
Dando O
. O

The O
blacks N
' O
dirty O
work N
isn't O
is O
n't O
any O
cleaner N
than O
the O
whites H
' O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
what O
they'll O
they O
'll O
be O
happy O
to O
note N
. O

But O
what O
their O
contented O
little O
minds N
will O
never O
know O
is O
that O
I H
knew O
it O
when O
I H
took O
the O
job N
, O
I H
knew O
it O
all O
along O
, O
and O
I'll O
I H
'll O
say O
it O
now O
as O
loud O
as O
I'd O
I H
'd O
say O
it O
then O
... O

Who'll O
Who O
'll O
be O
happy O
? O

Dando O
refilled O
the O
brandy N
glasses N
again O
. O

My H
colleagues H
! O

Those O
worthy O
fellows H
who've O
who O
've O
gone O
down O
South O
to O
Rhodesia O
and O
South O
Africa O
where O
they O
can O
feel O
confident O
they'll O
they O
'll O
never O
have O
a O
black O
man H
on O
the O
Bench N
to O
give O
a O
verdict N
as O
biased O
as O
a O
white O
man's O
man H
's H
. O

It O
was O
after O
midnight N
when O
they O
got O
to O
bed N
. O

Bray H
went O
to O
the O
kitchen N
to O
fill O
his O
brandy N
glass N
with O
water N
for O
the O
night N
. O

Cockroaches A
fled O
, O
pausing O
, O
from O
what O
they O
regarded O
as O
positions N
of O
safety N
, O
to O
twirl O
their O
antennae N
. O

A O
furry O
black O
band N
of O
ants A
led O
up O
a O
cupboard N
door N
to O
some O
scrap N
that O
had O
flicked O
from O
a O
plate N
. O

He O
stood O
at O
the O
sink N
, O
drinking O
cold O
water N
and O
looking O
at O
the O
avocado N
pear N
pip N
growing O
suspended O
by O
three O
matchsticks N
in O
the O
neck N
of O
a O
pickle N
jar N
of O
water N
on O
the O
sill N
. O

He O
was O
conscious O
of O
a O
giddy O
swing O
of O
weight N
from O
one N
foot N
to O
the O
other O
that O
was O
not O
of O
his O
volition N
; O
it O
seemed O
he O
had O
been O
standing N
there O
a O
long O
time N
– O
he O
was O
not O
sure O
. O

He O
heard O
Dando O
, O
forced O
by O
the O
old O
Labrador N
into O
the O
garden N
, O
walking O
about O
outside O
the O
guest H
hut N
and O
talking O
reproachfully O
to O
the O
dog A
; O

and O
then O
it O
was O
morning N
and O
Festus's O
Festus O
's H
assistant O
was O
at O
the O
door N
with O
the O
early O
tea N
. O

A O
helicopter N
snored O
over O
the O
celebrations N
, O
drowning O
the O
exchange O
of O
greetings N
when O
Bray H
was O
introduced O
to O
someone H
in O
the O
street N
, O
expunging O
conversation N
in O
bars N
and O
even O
speeches N
. O

Nobody O
knew O
what O
it O
was O
for O
... O
a O
security N
measure N
, O
some O
were O
satisfied O
to O
assume O
, O
while O
others O
accepted O
it O
as O
vaguely O
appropriate O
, O
the O
symbol N
of O
progress N
inseparable O
from O
all O
industrial O
fairs N
and O
agricultural O
shows N
and O
therefore O
somehow O
relevant O
to O
any O
public O
display O
. O

There O
was O
a O
moment N
in O
the O
stadium N
at O
the O
actual O
Independence O
ceremony N
when O
he O
heard O
it O
on O
the O
perimeter N
of O
the O
sky O
just O
as O
Kenyatta O
began O
to O
speak O
, O
and O
he O
and O
Vivien O
Bayley O
, O
the O
young O
wife H
of O
the O
registrar H
of O
the O
new O
university N
, O
sitting O
beside O
him O
, O
collided O
glances N
of O
alert N
apprehension N
... O

Later O
it O
was O
discovered O
to O
have O
been O
giving O
flips O
at O
half-a-crown O
a O
time N
to O
a O
section N
of O
the O
population N
who O
were O
queueing O
up O
, O
all O
through O
the O
ceremony N
, O
at O
the O
nearby O
soccer N
field N
; O

a O
publicity N
stunt N
for O
an O
international O
cigarette-making O
firm O
. O

Neil H
Bayley O
was O
the O
one N
to O
find O
this O
out O
, O
because O
of O
some O
domestic O
mishap N
or O
misunderstanding N
that O
made O
his O
arrival H
at O
the O
visitors H
' O
stand O
very O
late O
. O

Bray H
was O
conscious O
of O
furious O
tension N
between O
the O
young O
couple N
at O
his O
side N
as O
he O
sat O
with O
the O
great O
stir O
of O
tiers N
of O
people N
behind O
, O
and O
the O
space N
in O
front N
of O
him O
, O
before O
the O
velvet-draped O
and O
canopied O
dais N
, O
filled O
with O
press N
photographers H
and O
radio N
and O
television N
crews N
, O
who O
all O
through O
the O
solemnities N
raced O
about O
bent O
double O
on O
frantic O
tiptoe N
, O
snaking O
their O
wires N
, O
thrusting O
up O
their O
contraptions N
manipulating O
shutters N
and O
flashlights N
. O

It O
was O
as O
if O
with O
all O
made O
splendidly O
ready O
for O
a O
theatrical O
performance N
, O
a O
party N
of O
workmen H
with O
their O
gear N
had O
been O
left O
behind O
. O

This O
activity N
and O
the O
risen O
temper N
along O
the O
back O
of O
a O
silent O
quarrel N
beside O
him O
provided O
the O
strong O
distraction N
of O
another O
, O
disorderly O
level N
of O
being O
that O
always O
seemed O
to O
him O
to O
take O
away O
from O
planned O
great O
moments N
what O
they O
were O
meant O
to O
hold O
heady O
and O
pure O
. O

Here O
was O
the O
symbolic O
attainment N
of O
something O
he O
had O
believed O
in O
, O
willed O
and O
worked O
for O
, O
for O
a O
good O
stretch O
of O
his O
life N
: O

expressed O
in O
the O
roar N
that O
rocked O
back O
and O
forth O
from O
the O
crowd N
at O
intervals N
, O
the O
togas N
, O
medalled O
breasts N
and O
white O
gloves N
, O
the O
ululating O
cries O
of O
women H
, O
the O
soldiers H
at O
attention N
, O
and O
the O
sun N
striking O
off O
the O
clashing O
brass N
of O
the O
bands N
. O

Or O
in O
the O
icecream N
tricycles N
waiting O
at O
the O
base N
of O
each O
section N
of O
an O
amphitheatre N
of O
dark O
faces N
, O
the O
mongrel N
that O
ran O
out O
and O
lifted O
its O
leg N
on O
the O
presidential O
dais N
? O

Mweta O
had O
the O
mummified O
look O
of O
one N
who O
has O
become O
a O
vessel N
of O
ritual N
. O

But O
once O
the O
declaration N
of O
independence N
was O
pronounced O
he O
came O
, O
as O
out O
of O
a O
trance N
, O
to O
an O
irresistibly O
lively O
self O
, O
sitting O
up O
there O
seeing O
everything O
around O
him O
, O
a O
spectator H
, O
Bray H
felt N
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
spectacle N
. O

Bray H
was O
half-embarrassed O
to O
find O
that O
he O
even O
caught O
his O
eye N
, O
once O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
quick O
smile O
; O
but O
Mweta O
was O
used O
to O
having O
eyes N
on O
him O
, O
by O
now O
. O

He O
talked O
to O
the O
elderly O
English O
princess H
who O
sat O
beside O
him O
with O
her O
knees N
peaked O
neatly O
together O
in O
the O
Royal O
position N
curiously O
expressive O
of O
the O
suffering N
of O
ceremonies N
, O
and O
Bray H
saw O
him O
point N
out O
the O
contingent N
of O
Gala N
women H
, O
their O
faces N
and O
breasts N
whitened O
for O
joy N
, O
who O
were O
lined O
up O
among O
the O
troops N
of O
musicians H
and O
dancers H
from O
various O
regions N
. O

And O
yet O
when O
that O
ceremony N
was O
over O
, O
and O
in O
between O
all O
the O
other O
official O
occasions N
– O
State N
Ball O
, O
receptions N
, O
cocktail N
parties N
, O
banquets N
, O
and O
luncheons N
– O
a O
mood N
of O
celebration N
grew O
up O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
outside O
the O
palace N
gates N
. O

He O
attended O
most O
of O
the O
official O
occasions N
( O
he O
and O
Roly O
saluted O
each O
other O
with O
mock O
surprise O
when O
they O
met O
in O
the O
house N
, O
half-dressed O
in O
formal O
dinner N
clothes N
every O
night N
) O
but O
the O
real O
parties N
took O
place N
before O
and O
after O
. O

These O
grew O
spontaneously O
one N
out O
of O
the O
other O
, O
and O
once O
you H
had O
been O
present N
at O
the O
first O
, O
you H
got O
handed O
on O
to O
all O
the O
others O
. O

He O
really O
knew O
only O
some O
of O
the O
people N
but O
all O
of O
them O
seemed O
to O
know O
about O
him O
, O
and O
many O
were O
the O
friends H
of O
friends H
. O

Dando O
took O
him O
to O
the O
Bayleys O
; O
but O
Neil H
was O
a O
friend H
of O
Mweta O
, O
and O
Vivien O
was O
the O
niece H
of O
, O
of O
all O
people N
, O
Sir O
William H
Clough O
, O
the O
last O
governor H
, O
who O
had O
been O
a O
junior O
with O
Bray H
in O
the O
colonial O
service N
in O
Tanganyika O
. O

The O
Bayleys O
were O
friends H
of O
Cyprian O
Kente O
, O
Mweta's O
Mweta O
's H
Minister H
of O
the O
Interior O
, O
and O
his O
wife H
Tindi O
, O
and O
Timothy H
Odara O
, O
one N
of O
the O
territory's O
territory N
's H
few O
African O
doctors H
, O
whom O
Bray H
, O
of O
course N
, O
knew O
well O
. O

Through O
each O
individual O
the O
group N
extended O
to O
someone H
else O
and O
drew O
in O
, O
out O
of O
the O
new O
international O
character A
of O
the O
little O
capital N
, O
Poles H
, O
Ghanaians O
, O
Hungarians H
and O
Israelis O
, O
South O
African O
and O
Rhodesian O
refugees H
. O

After O
the O
State N
Ball O
there O
was O
a O
private O
all-night O
party N
in O
a O
marquee N
. O

Roly O
Dando O
had O
promised O
to O
drop O
by O
, O
and O
of O
course N
Bray H
was O
with O
him O
. O

Cheers N
went O
up O
from O
the O
people N
already O
present N
who O
had O
not O
been O
at O
the O
ball N
; O
they O
had O
decided O
to O
dress O
for O
once O
, O
too O
, O
and O
the O
two O
groups N
of O
women H
mingled O
and O
exclaimed O
over O
each O
other O
, O
everyone O
began O
to O
talk O
about O
what O
the O
ball N
was O
like O
, O
champagne N
came O
in O
, O
a O
Congolese O
band N
whipped O
up O
their O
pace N
, O
and O
the O
absurd O
and O
slightly O
thrilling O
mood N
of O
the O
State N
Ball O
and O
the O
cosy O
gaiety N
of O
the O
party N
swept O
together O
. O

The O
tent N
was O
filled O
with O
chairs N
and O
divans N
borrowed O
from O
people's O
people N
's H
houses N
, O
and O
flowers A
from O
their O
gardens N
. O

Someone O
had O
put O
up O
a O
board N
with O
a O
collage N
of O
blown-up O
pictures N
of O
Mweta O
– O
speaking O
, O
laughing O
, O
yawning O
, O
touching O
a O
piece N
of O
machinery N
with O
curiosity N
, O
leaving O
, O
arriving O
, O
even O
threatening O
. O

Many O
other O
people N
Bray H
had O
seen O
at O
the O
ball N
streamed O
in O
in O
their O
finery N
: O

they O
had O
contributed O
to O
the O
arrangements N
for O
this O
party N
. O

The O
trouble N
everyone O
had O
taken O
gave O
a O
sense N
of O
occasion N
to O
even O
the O
wildest O
moments N
of O
the O
night N
. O

Vivien O
Bayley O
, O
queenly O
at O
twenty-six O
, O
with O
her O
beautiful O
, O
well-mannered O
, O
disciplined O
face N
, O
came O
to O
hover O
beside O
Bray H
between O
responsible O
permutations N
about O
the O
room N
to O
make O
sure O
that O
this O
young O
girl H
was O
not O
being O
bothered O
too O
much O
by O
the O
attentions N
of O
someone H
older O
and O
rather O
drunk O
, O
or O
that O
young O
man H
was O
not O
being O
overlooked O
by O
the O
girls H
who O
ought O
to O
be O
taking O
notice O
of O
him O
. O

Bray H
surprised O
her O
by O
asking O
her O
to O
dance O
, O
swaying O
stiffly O
to O
a O
rhythm N
he O
didn't O
did O
n't O
know O
, O
but O
nevertheless O
keeping N
the O
beat O
, O
so O
that O
they O
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
make O
fools H
of O
themselves O
among O
the O
complicated O
gyrations N
of O
the O
Africans H
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
so O
glad O
you H
dance O
, O
she O
said O
; O
he O
was O
ashamed O
that O
he O
had O
asked O
her O
only O
out O
of O
politeness N
. O

Neil H
won't O
wo O
n't O
... O
I H
think O
it's O
it O
's H
a O
mistake N
to O
let O
oneself O
forget O
these O
things N
because O
of O
vanity N
. O

Tindi O
Kente O
is O
a O
wonderful O
dancer H
, O
wonderful O
, O
isn't O
is O
n't O
she O
... O
just O
like O
a O
snake A
brought O
out O
by O
music N
, O
and O
sometimes O
he'll O
he O
'll O
try O
with O
her O
. O

He O
loves O
to O
flirt O
with O
her O
when O
Cyprian's O
Cyprian O
's H
not O
looking O
, O
but O
get O
her O
doing O
her O
marvellous O
wriggle N
on O
the O
floor N
and O
he O
just O
stands O
there O
like O
Andrew H
, O
dragging O
his O
feet N
. O

Andrew H
was O
probably O
one N
of O
her O
children H
; O

being O
accepted O
with O
such O
immediate O
casual O
friendliness N
by O
everyone O
was O
rather O
like O
being O
forced O
to O
learn O
a O
foreign O
language N
by O
finding O
oneself O
alone O
among O
people N
who O
spoke O
nothing N
else O
: O

it O
was O
assumed O
that O
he O
would O
pick O
up O
family H
and O
other O
relationships N
merely O
by O
being O
exposed O
to O
them O
. O

Someone O
called O
to O
Vivien O
and O
they O
were O
drawn O
away O
from O
the O
dancers H
to O
a O
crowded O
table N
. O

A O
young O
woman H
leaned O
her O
elbows N
on O
it O
and O
her O
white O
breasts N
pursed O
forward O
within O
the O
frame O
of O
her O
arms N
. O

Have O
my H
glass N
, O
she O
said O
, O
as O
there O
were O
no O
spare O
ones N
to O
go O
round O
. O

She O
went O
off O
to O
dance O
, O
holding O
in O
her O
stomach N
as O
she O
squeezed O
past N
and O
balanced O
her O
soft-looking O
body N
. O

The O
heat N
was O
heightened O
by O
drink N
and O
animation N
and O
the O
glass N
filled O
by O
the O
long O
, O
narrow O
black O
hand N
of O
his O
neighbour H
was O
marked O
by O
the O
fingerprints N
of O
the O
white O
woman H
who O
had O
relinquished O
it O
. O

You H
don't O
do O
n't O
remember O
me H
? O

Ras O
Asahe O
, O
I H
came O
to O
your H
place N
in O
England O
once O
. O

The O
young O
man H
said O
he O
was O
in O
broadcasting O
now O
, O
so-called O
assistant O
to O
the O
Director O
of O
English O
Language N
Services N
. O

And O
how's O
how O
's H
your H
father H
? O

Good O
Lord A
, O
I'd O
I H
'd O
like O
to O
see O
him O
again O
! O

Joseph H
Asahe O
was O
one N
of O
Edward H
Shinza's O
Shinza O
's H
lieutenants H
in O
the O
early O
days N
of O
PIP O
. O

He's O
He O
's H
old O
now O
. O

It O
was O
not O
the O
right O
question N
to O
have O
asked O
; O

what O
the O
young O
man H
dismissed O
was O
any O
possible O
suggestion N
that O
he O
was O
to O
be O
thought O
of O
in O
connection N
with O
Shinza O
. O

His O
clothes N
, O
watch O
, O
cufflinks N
were O
those O
of O
a O
man H
who O
feels O
he O
must O
buy O
the O
best O
for O
himself O
, O
he O
had O
the O
Mussolini-jaw O
quite O
common O
among O
the O
people N
in O
the O
part N
of O
the O
country N
he O
came O
from O
but O
those O
hands N
were O
the O
lyrical O
, O
delicately O
strong O
, O
African O
ones N
that O
escaped O
the O
international O
blandness N
of O
businessmen's O
businessmen H
's H
hands N
as O
Bray H
had O
marvelled O
to O
see O
them O
escape O
the O
brutalizing O
of O
physical O
hardship N
. O

Convicts H
broke O
stones N
with O
hands N
like O
that O
, O
here O
. O

They O
made O
conversation N
about O
the O
radio N
and O
television N
coverage N
of O
the O
celebrations N
, O
and O
from O
this O
broke O
into O
talk O
that O
interested O
them O
both O
: O

the O
problem N
of O
communication N
in O
a O
country N
with O
so O
many O
different O
language N
groups N
. O

I H
wonder O
how O
much O
use O
could O
be O
made O
of O
a O
radio N
classroom N
in O
country N
schools N
, O
whether O
it O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
help O
considerably O
to O
ease N
the O
shortage N
of O
teachers H
, O
here O
, O
and O
maintain O
some O
sort N
of O
standard O
where O
teachers H
are O
perhaps O
not O
very O
well O
qualified O
. O

I'd O
I H
'd O
like O
to O
talk O
to O
somebody H
about O
it O
... O
your H
man H
? O

I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
keen O
to O
go O
straight O
to O
the O
Director-General O
... O

It O
won't O
wo O
n't O
make O
much O
difference N
. O

They O
laughed O
at O
him O
again O
. O

Everyone O
was O
gathering N
round O
for O
servings N
from O
the O
roast O
sheep A
, O
and O
the O
fair O
stocky O
man H
from O
the O
airport N
signalled O
a O
greeting N
with O
a O
piece N
of O
meat N
in O
his O
fingers N
. O

Wentz O
, O
Hjalmar O
Wentz O
, O
we H
met O
on O
the O
plane N
. O

Roland H
Dando O
said O
we H
probably O
should O
be O
seeing O
you H
at O
the O
Rhino O
. O

They O
moved O
off O
with O
their O
plates N
of O
food N
, O
and O
Wentz O
said O
to O
a O
woman H
settled O
in O
one N
of O
the O
canvas N
chairs N
, O
Margot O
, O
here O
is O
Colonel O
Bray H
. O

No O
, O
no O
, O
please O
stay O
where O
you H
are O
. O

In O
the O
fuss N
to O
find O
somewhere O
to O
sit O
he O
saw O
the O
light N
of O
the O
fire N
under O
the O
spit O
running O
along O
the O
shiny O
planes N
of O
the O
woman's O
woman H
's H
face N
as O
it O
did O
on O
glasses N
and O
the O
movement N
of O
knives N
and O
forks N
. O

Bright O
hair N
was O
brushed O
up O
off O
a O
high O
round O
forehead N
and O
behind O
the O
ears N
, O
in O
a O
way N
he O
associated O
with O
busy O
, O
capable O
women H
. O

Try O
some O
, O
Margot O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
wonderful O
... O

Aren't O
Are O
n't O
I H
fat O
enough O
... O

But O
she O
took O
a O
tidbit N
of O
crisp O
fat O
from O
her O
husband's O
husband H
's H
fork N
. O

To O
tell O
the O
truth N
, O
this's O
this O
's H
the O
first O
time N
for O
a O
week N
we've O
we H
've O
had O
time N
to O
sit O
down O
to O
eat O
. O

Margot's O
Margot O
's H
had O
to O
be O
in O
the O
kitchen N
herself O
from O
six O
in O
the O
morning N
, O
and O
some O
nights N
it's O
it O
's H
been O
until O
ten O
. O

She O
literally O
hasn't O
has O
n't O
sat O
down O
to O
a O
meal N
... O

Oh O
, O
not O
quite O
... O
I H
must O
have O
had O
hundreds N
of O
cups N
of O
coffee N
. O

Yes O
, O
with O
one N
hand N
while O
you H
were O
busy O
stirring O
a O
pot N
with O
the O
other O
. O

The O
cook O
went O
to O
the O
Independence O
ceremony N
and O
we H
haven't O
have O
n't O
seen O
him O
since O
... O
just O
for O
the O
afternoon N
, O
he O
said O
, O
just O
to O
see O
the O
great O
men H
he's O
he O
's H
seen O
in O
the O
papers N
... O
well O
, O
what O
can O
you H
say O
? O

We H
felt N
it O
was O
his O
day N
, O
after O
all O
. O

The O
woman H
showed O
a O
wellshaped O
smile O
in O
the O
dark O
. O

Bray H
asked O
, O
How O
on O
earth N
have O
you H
managed O
? O

She O
gestured O
and O
laughed O
, O
but O
her O
husband H
was O
eager O
to O
break O
in O
, O
holding O
up O
his O
hands N
over O
the O
plate N
balanced O
on O
his O
knees N
. O

A O
hundred O
and O
twenty-two O
for O
dinner N
! O

That's O
That O
's H
what O
it O
was O
on O
Thursday O
. O
And O
yesterday N
... O
Only O
a O
hundred O
and O
nine O
, O
that's O
that O
's H
all O
... O

They O
laughed O
. O

Bray H
raised O
his O
beer N
mug N
of O
wine N
to O
her O
. O

What O
about O
my H
assistant O
cook O
? O

You H
mustn't O
must O
n't O
forget O
I've O
I H
've O
got O
help O
, O
she O
said O
. O

Wentz O
put O
down O
his O
glass N
beside O
his O
chair N
, O
to O
do O
the O
justice N
of O
full O
attention N
to O
what O
he O
was O
going O
to O
say O
. O

Her O
assistant O
cook O
. O

I H
got O
him O
from O
the O
new O
labour O
exchange O
– O
I H
thought O
, O
well O
, O
let's O
let O
's H
try O
it O
, O
so O
they O
send O
him O
along O
, O
five O
years N
' O
experience N
, O
everything O
fine O
. O

His O
wife H
was O
listening O
, O
laughing O
softly O
, O
sitting O
back O
majestically O
for O
a O
moment N
. O

Five O
years N
' O
experience N
, O
but O
d' O
you H
know O
what O
as O
? O

You H
know O
the O
barbers H
under O
the O
mango A
trees A
there O
just O
before O
you H
get O
to O
the O
second-class O
trading N
area N
? O

Our H
son's O
son H
's H
comment O
was O
the O
best O
, O
I H
think O
. O

Well O
, O
here's O
here O
's H
to O
three O
crazy O
people N
, O
said O
Wentz O
, O
excitedly O
picking O
up O
his O
glass N
. O

Everyone O
knows O
you H
must O
be O
crazy O
to O
come O
of O
your H
own O
free O
will O
to O
one N
of O
these O
countries N
. O

Colonel O
Bray H
isn't O
is O
n't O
going O
to O
run O
a O
hotel N
. O

She O
had O
a O
soft O
, O
dry H
voice H
and O
her O
accent O
was O
slighter O
than O
her O
husband's O
husband H
's H
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
as O
brave O
as O
you H
are O
. O

Oh O
, O
how O
do O
you H
know O
? O
said O
Wentz O
. O

We H
didn't O
did O
n't O
know O
what O
we H
were O
going O
to O
land O
up O
doing O
, O
either O
. O

She O
said O
quietly O
, O
We H
certainly O
didn't O
did O
n't O
think O
we'd O
we H
'd O
be O
the O
proprietors H
of O
the O
Silver O
Rhino O
. O

Anyway O
, O
that's O
that O
's H
another O
story N
, O
said O
Wentz O
. O

Oh O
, O
did O
you H
? O
he O
laughed O
. O

Well O
, O
perhaps O
I H
am O
, O
then O
. O

I H
should O
think O
the O
bar N
of O
the O
Silver O
Rhino's O
Rhino O
's H
as O
good O
a O
place N
as O
any O
to O
learn O
what's O
what O
's H
really O
going O
on O
. O

If O
you H
want O
to O
hear O
how O
much O
ugliness N
there O
is O
– O
yes O
. O

Mrs. O
Wentz O
had O
the O
tone N
of O
voice H
that O
sounds N
as O
if O
the O
speaker N
is O
addressing O
noone O
but O
himself O
. O

How O
people N
still O
think O
with O
their O
blood N
and O
enjoy O
to O
contempt N
... O
yes O
, O
the O
bar N
at O
the O
Silver O
Rhino O
. O

Our H
son H
Stephen H
is O
looking O
after O
it O
tonight N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
amazing O
how O
he O
deals N
with O
those O
fellows H
– O
better O
than O
I H
do O
, O
I H
can O
tell O
you H
. O

He O
keeps O
them O
in O
place N
. O

We H
promised O
him O
a O
liberal O
education N
when O
we H
left O
South O
Africa O
, O
you H
see O
. O

Mrs. O
Wentz O
had O
put O
down O
her O
food N
and O
she O
sat O
back O
out O
of O
the O
light N
of O
the O
fire N
, O
a O
big O
face N
glimmering O
in O
the O
dark O
, O
caverns N
where O
the O
eyes N
were O
. O

taking O
the O
A O
levels N
, O
said O
Wentz O
, O
innocently O
. O

You're O
You H
're O
not O
going O
to O
finish O
? O

The O
white O
blur O
of O
her O
hand N
moved O
in O
a O
gesture N
of O
rejection N
... O

You H
have O
it O
, O
Hjalmar O
. O

It O
rained O
and O
people N
felt N
chilly O
on O
the O
veranda N
and O
drifted O
indoors O
. O

There O
was O
a O
group N
in O
loud O
discussion N
round O
the O
empty O
fireplace N
where O
the O
beer N
bottles N
were O
stacked O
... O

banging O
on O
the O
Governor's O
Governor H
's H
door N
with O
a O
panga N
when O
the O
others O
were O
still O
picannins O
with O
snotty O
noses N
... O

Now O
Dando O
had O
the O
sulky O
outraged O
attention N
of O
a O
young O
patriot H
from O
the O
social O
welfare N
department N
, O
the O
glittering-eyed O
indifference N
of O
Doris H
Manyema O
, O
one N
of O
the O
country's O
country N
's H
three O
or O
four O
women H
graduates H
, O
and O
the O
amused O
appreciation N
of O
a O
South O
African O
refugee H
whose O
yellow-brown O
colour N
, O
small O
nose N
and O
fine O
lips N
set O
him O
apart O
from O
the O
blackness N
of O
the O
other O
two O
. O

In O
the O
light N
, O
Margot O
Wentz's O
Wentz O
's H
head N
was O
the O
figurehead H
of O
a O
ship N
above O
the O
hulk N
of O
her O
body N
: O

a O
double-chinned O
, O
handsome O
dark O
blonde O
, O
the O
short O
high O
nose N
coming O
from O
the O
magnificent O
forehead N
, O
water-coloured O
eyes N
underlined O
with O
cuts O
of O
fatigue N
deep O
into O
each O
cheek N
. O

With O
an O
absent O
smile O
to O
Bray H
across O
the O
room N
, O
she O
took O
up O
, O
for O
a O
moment N
, O
an O
abandoned O
beauty N
. O

When O
he O
joined O
the O
group N
, O
they O
were O
listening O
to O
her O
. O

We H
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
argue O
; O
we H
can O
take O
it O
that O
colonialism N
is O
indefensible O
, O
for O
us H
, O
no O
? O

You H
think O
so O
, O
I H
think O
so O
... O
right O
. O

Timothy H
Odara's O
Odara O
's H
eyes N
were O
closed O
; O
leaning O
against O
the O
wall N
he O
kept O
his O
lips N
drawn O
back O
slightly O
, O
alert N
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
sorry O
, O
forty-eight O
years N
you H
were O
under O
British O
rule N
, O
digging O
their O
mines N
, O
building N
roads N
for O
them O
, O
making O
towns N
, O
living O
in O
shanties N
and O
waiting O
on O
them O
, O
cleaning N
up O
after O
them O
, O
treated O
like O
dirt N
... O
now O
it's O
it O
's H
all O
over O
, O
you H
really O
think O
there O
was O
any O
way N
at O
all O
you H
could O
enter O
the O
modern O
world N
without O
suffering N
? O

You H
think O
there O
was O
someone H
else O
would O
have O
given O
you H
the O
alphabet N
! O
and O
electricity N
and O
killed O
off O
the O
malaria N
mosquito A
, O
just O
for O
love O
? O

The O
Finns H
? O
The O
Russians O
? O
Anybody O
? O

Anyone O
who O
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
have O
wanted O
the O
last O
drop O
of O
your H
sweat O
and O
pride N
in O
return O
? O

These O
are O
the O
facts N
. O

From O
your H
point N
of O
view N
, O
as O
it O
luckily O
lasted O
less O
than O
two O
generations A
. O
Wasn't O
Was O
n't O
it O
worth N
it O
? O

Would O
anybody O
have O
let O
you H
in O
for O
nothing N
? O

Anybody O
at O
all O
? O

That's O
That O
's H
what O
I'm O
I H
'm O
asking O
... O

Wouldn't O
Would O
n't O
you H
have O
to O
pay O
the O
price N
in O
suffering N
? O

Oh O
you H
make O
the O
usual O
mistake N
of O
seeing O
the O
life N
of O
the O
African O
people N
as O
a O
blank O
... O
and O
then O
the O
colonialists H
come O
along O
and O
we H
come O
to O
life N
– O
in O
your H
compounds N
and O
back O
yards N
. O

She O
was O
shaking O
her O
head N
slowly O
while O
Odara O
was O
speaking O
. O

All O
I'm O
I H
'm O
saying O
, O
don't O
do O
n't O
wear O
the O
sufferings N
of O
the O
past N
round O
your H
necks N
. O

What O
does O
independence N
mean O
– O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
use O
freedom N
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
big O
words N
– O
what O
does O
your H
independence N
mean O
, O
then O
? O

The O
past N
is O
useful O
for O
political O
purposes N
only O
said O
Hjalmar O
, O
as O
he O
might O
have O
said O
: O
she's O
she O
's H
right O
. O

Someone O
said O
, O
Watch O
out O
for O
the O
man H
from O
the O
CIA O
. O

Down O
with O
neo-colonialism O
. O

Of O
course N
, O
Curtis H
, O
said O
Hjalmar O
. O

But O
if O
you H
have O
to O
do O
it O
by O
keeping N
that O
forty O
years N
or O
whatever O
sitting O
at O
the O
table N
with O
you H
and O
your H
children H
... O
ach O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
healthy O
, O
it O
makes O
me H
sick O
. O

What O
do O
they O
want O
to O
hear O
how O
you H
had O
to O
go O
round O
to O
the O
back O
door N
of O
the O
missionary's O
missionary H
's H
house N
? O

Mrs. O
Odara O
had O
joined O
the O
group N
, O
running O
a O
big O
, O
silver-nailed O
hand N
through O
Curtis H
Pettigrew's O
Pettigrew O
's H
crew-cut O
hair N
. O

Oh O
God H
, O
Timothy H
, O
not O
that O
again O
. O

Odara O
laughed O
. O

But O
it O
always O
comes O
down O
to O
the O
same O
thing N
: O
you H
Europeans H
talk O
very O
reasonably O
about O
that O
sort N
of O
suffering N
because O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
... O
you H
may O
have O
thought O
it O
was O
terrible O
, O
but O
there's O
there O
's H
nothing N
like O
that O
in O
your H
lives O
. O

Bray H
saw O
Margot O
Wentz O
put O
up O
her O
head N
with O
a O
quick O
grimace-smile O
, O
as O
if O
someone H
had O
told O
an O
old O
joke N
she O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
raise O
a O
laugh O
for O
. O

Well O
, O
here O
you're O
you H
're O
mistaken O
, O
her O
husband H
said O
, O
rather O
grandly O
, O
we H
lived O
under O
Mr. N
Hitler H
. O

And O
you H
must O
know O
all O
about O
that O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
interested O
in O
Hitler H
. O

Timothy H
Odara's O
Odara O
's H
fine O
teeth N
were O
bared O
in O
impatient O
pleasantness N
. O

My H
friend H
, O
white O
men H
have O
killed O
more O
people N
in O
Africa O
than O
Hitler H
ever O
did O
in O
Europe O
. O

But O
you're O
you H
're O
crazy O
, O
said O
Wentz O
gently O
. O

Europe's O
Europe O
's H
wars N
, O
white O
men's O
men H
's H
killings N
among O
themselves O
. O
What's O
What O
's H
that O
to O
me H
? O

You've O
You H
've O
just O
said O
one N
shouldn't O
should O
n't O
burden N
oneself O
with O
suffering N
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
feelings N
about O
Hitler H
. O

Oh O
but O
you H
should O
, O
Mrs. O
Wentz O
said O
, O
almost O
dreaming O
. O

No O
more O
and O
no O
less O
than O
you H
do O
about O
what O
happened O
to O
Africans H
. O

It's O
It O
's H
all O
the O
same O
thing N
. O

A O
slave H
in O
the O
hold O
of O
a O
ship N
in O
the O
eighteenth O
century N
and O
a O
Jew H
or O
a O
gipsy H
in O
a O
concentration N
camp N
in O
the O
nineteen-forties O
. O

Well O
, O
I H
had O
my H
seventeenth O
and O
eighteenth O
birthdays N
in O
the O
detention N
camp N
at O
Fort O
Howard O
, O
the O
guest H
of O
Her O
Majesty's O
Majesty N
's H
governor H
, O
said O
Odara O
, O
that O
I H
know O
. O

Her O
two O
brothers H
died O
at O
Auschwitz O
, O
Hjalmar O
Wentz O
said O
; O

but O
his O
wife H
was O
talking O
to O
Jo-Ann O
Pettigrew O
, O
who O
offered O
blobs N
of O
toasted O
marshmallow N
on O
the O
end N
of O
a O
long O
fork N
. O

For O
God's O
God H
's H
sake N
, O
Timothy H
, O
stop N
baring O
your H
teeth N
and O
sink N
them O
into O
something O
. O

Evelyn H
Odara O
spoke O
to O
her O
husband H
as O
no O
local O
woman H
would O
dare O
; O
yet O
he O
ignored O
it O
, O
as O
if O
turning O
the O
tables N
on O
her O
with O
his O
countrymen's O
countrymen H
's H
assumption N
that O
what O
women H
said O
was O
not O
heard O
, O
anyway O
. O

He O
said O
angrily O
to O
Wentz O
, O
directing O
the O
remark N
at O
the O
wife H
through O
the O
husband H
, O
What O
did O
you H
get O
in O
return O
that O
was O
worth N
it O
? O

Margot O
Wentz O
said O
, O
looking O
at O
no O
one N
, O
That O
one N
can't O
ca O
n't O
say O
. O

She O
waggled O
her O
fingers N
, O
sticky O
from O
the O
marshmallow N
, O
and O
her O
husband H
took O
his O
handkerchief N
from O
his O
pocket N
and O
gave O
it O
to O
her O
. O

It O
was O
the O
evening N
when O
Bray H
, O
Neil H
, O
Evelyn H
Odara O
, O
one N
of O
the O
South O
African O
refugees H
, O
the O
Pettigrews O
, O
and O
a O
few O
others O
set O
off O
for O
the O
Sputnik O
Bar N
. O

While O
Bray H
was O
standing N
about O
in O
the O
group N
with O
the O
Odaras O
and O
the O
Wentzes O
, O
Jo-Ann O
Pettigrew O
, O
having O
failed O
to O
get O
him O
to O
eat O
her O
last O
marshmallow N
, O
put O
it O
in O
her O
mouth N
and O
signalled O
to O
everyone O
there O
was O
something O
they O
must O
hear O
. O

Rebecca's O
Rebecca H
's H
been O
to O
the O
Sputnik O
and O
she O
says O
it's O
it O
's H
terrific O
now O
. O

They've O
They O
've O
knocked O
out O
a O
wall N
into O
that O
sort N
of O
yard N
thing N
and O
they O
have O
dancing N
. O

With O
girls H
laid O
on O
. O

Neil H
said O
, O
Hey O
? O

And O
which O
one N
of O
us's O
us H
's H
been O
taking O
Rebecca H
to O
the O
Sputnik O
? O

Laughter N
rose O
. O

Well O
, O
why O
don't O
do O
n't O
we H
all O
go O
, O
that's O
that O
's H
what O
I H
want O

The O
young O
Pettigrew O
woman H
was O
always O
in O
a O
state N
of O
enthusiasm N
; O

her O
long O
curly O
hair N
had O
sprung O
out O
, O
diademed O
with O
raindrops N
, O
because O
she O
had O
done O
her O
marshmallow N
toasting O
outside O
over O
the O
spit O
fire N
. O

She O
was O
an O
anthropologist H
, O
and O
Bray H
accepted O
this O
as O
an O
explanation N
for O
her O
passion N
for O
arranging O
excursions N
, O
on O
which O
she O
carried O
her O
baby H
tied O
on O
her O
back O
, O
African O
style N
. O

Who O
was O
it O
? O

There O
was O
a O
roar N
again O
. O

No O
, O
no O
– O
well O
, O
Ras O
took O
her O
... O

Oh O
Ras O
, O
was O
it O
? O

Sputnik O
Bar N
, O
eh O
? O

So O
that's O
that O
's H
it O
, O
now O
. O

Rebecca H
Edwards H
came O
in O
from O
the O
veranda N
, O
smiling O
good-naturedly O
, O
inquiringly O
, O
under O
the O
remarks N
shied O
at O
her O
. O

She O
said O
, O
There're O
There O
're O
bulbs N
like O
you H
see O
in O
films N
round O
the O
star's O
star N
's H
dressing-table O
, O
and O
they O
light N
up O
and O
spell O
INDEPENDENCE N
HURRAH O
. O

In O
great O
confusion N
, O
there O
and O
then O
they O
decided O
to O
go O
. O

Dando O
refused O
and O
Vivien O
had O
to O
go O
home N
to O
the O
children H
, O
and O
Rebecca H
Edwards H
protested O
that O
hers O
were O
alone O
too O
. O

Neil H
insisted O
that O
Bray H
must O
come O
; O

he O
was O
one N
of O
those O
people N
who O
, O
late O
at O
night N
, O
suddenly O
have O
a O
desperate O
need O
of O
certain O
companions H
. O

But O
when O
Neil H
, O
Bray H
, O
Evelyn H
Odara O
and O
the O
South O
African O
got O
down O
to O
the O
second-class O
trading N
area N
, O
the O
others O
hadn't O
had O
n't O
arrived O
. O

They O
went O
into O
the O
Sputnik O
Bar N
for O
a O
moment N
, O
meeting N
music N
like O
a O
buffeting N
about O
the O
head N
, O
and O
then O
someone H
said O
that O
he O
thought O
the O
arrangement N
had O
been O
to O
meet O
at O
the O
railway N
crossing O
. O

There O
began O
one N
of O
those O
chases O
about O
in O
the O
night N
that O
, O
Bray H
saw O
, O
Neil H
Bayley O
fiercely O
enjoyed O
. O

They O
went O
all O
the O
way N
back O
into O
town N
to O
the O
flats N
where O
the O
Edwards H
girl H
lived O
... O

Neil H
stood O
on O
the O
moonlit O
patch N
of O
earth N
in O
front N
of O
the O
dark O
building N
and O
called O
up O
, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
response N
. O

They O
stopped O
somewhere O
to O
give O
a O
man H
a O
lift O
; O
he O
was O
caught O
in O
the O
lights N
, O
hat N
in O
hand N
; O
only O
his O
clean O
white O
shirt N
had O
shown O
on O
the O
dark O
road N
. O

He O
answered O
Neil H
with O
a O
liberal O
use O
of O
Bwana O
, O
as O
a O
white O
man H
would O
expect O
if O
he O
were O
to O
do O
such O
a O
thing N
as O
stop N
for O
a O
black O
one N
on O
the O
road N
, O
and O
when O
he O
got O
into O
the O
car N
beside O
Bray H
and O
the O
South O
African O
, O
sat O
among O
these O
black O
and O
white O
city N
people N
like O
a O
hedgehog A
rolled O
into O
itself O
at O
a O
touch O
. O

Bray H
, O
back O
in O
this O
country N
once O
more O
, O
again O
aware O
of O
his O
own O
height N
and O
size N
and O
pinkness N
almost O
like O
some O
form N
of O
aggression N
he O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
responsible O
for O
, O
knew O
that O
the O
fellow H
was O
holding O
himself O
away O
from O
contact O
with O
him O
. O

The O
voices N
of O
Evelyn H
, O
Neil H
, O
and O
the O
South O
African O
flew O
about O
the O
car N
; O

they O
passed O
the O
shadows N
of O
the O
mango A
trees A
in O
the O
bright O
moonlight N
lying O
beneath O
the O
trees A
like O
sleeping O
beasts A
; O

a O
donkey A
cropping O
among O
broken O
china N
on O
a O
refuse O
mound N
; O

the O
colours N
on O
the O
mosque N
almost O
visible O
, O
the O
silvered O
burglar H
grilles N
on O
the O
elaborate O
houses N
of O
the O
Indian O
sector N
. O

The O
second-class O
trading N
area N
had O
been O
laid O
out O
long O
ago O
and O
haphazardly O
; O
shops N
cropped O
up O
suddenly O
, O
streets N
met O
, O
the O
car N
plunged O
and O
rolled O
. O

THE O
WORST O
BIRTHDAY N

Not O
for O
the O
first O
time N
, O
an O
argument N
had O
broken O
out O
over O
breakfast N
at O
number N
four O
, O
Privet O
Drive O
. O

Mr N
Vernon H
Dursley O
had O
been O
woken O
in O
the O
early O
hours N
of O
the O
morning N
by O
a O
loud O
, O
hooting O
noise N
from O
his O
nephew H
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
room N
. O

Harry H
tried O
, O
yet O
again O
, O
to O
explain O
. O

If O
I H
could O
just O
let O
her O
out O
at O
night N
– O

He O
exchanged O
dark O
looks O
with O
his O
wife H
, O
Petunia O
. O

Harry H
tried O
to O
argue O
back O
but O
his O
words N
were O
drowned O
by O
a O
long O
, O
loud O
belch N
from O
the O
Dursleys O
son H
, O
Dudley H
. O

We H
must O
feed O
you H
up O
while O
we've O
we H
've O
got O
the O
chance N
. O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
sound N
of O
that O
school N
food N

Dudley H
, O
who O
was O
so O
large O
his O
bottom N
drooped O
over O
either O
side N
of O
the O
kitchen N
chair N
, O
grinned O
and O
turned O
to O
Harry H
. O

The O
effect N
of O
this O
simple O
sentence N
on O
the O
rest N
of O
the O
family H
was O
incredible O
: O
Dudley H
gasped O
and O
fell O
off O
his O
chair N
with O
a O
crash O
that O
shook O
the O
whole O
kitchen N
; O
Mrs N
Dursley O
gave O
a O
small O
scream N
and O
clapped O
her O
hands N
to O
her O
mouth N
; O
Mr N
Dursley O
jumped O
to O
his O
feet N
, O
veins N
throbbing O
in O
his O
temples N
. O

I H
meant O
" O
please O
" O
! O
said O
Harry H
quickly O
. O

Harry H
stared O
from O
his O
purple-faced O
uncle H
to O
his O
pale O
aunt H
, O
who O
was O
trying O
to O
heave O
Dudley H
to O
his O
feet N
. O

Uncle H
Vernon H
sat O
back O
down O
, O
breathing N
like O
a O
winded O
rhinoceros A
and O
watching O
Harry H
closely O
out O
of O
the O
corners N
of O
his O
small O
, O
sharp O
eyes N
. O

ever O
since O
Harry H
had O
come O
home N
for O
the O
summer N
holidays N
, O
Uncle H
Vernon H
had O
been O
treating O
him O
like O
a O
bomb N
that O
might O
go O
off O
at O
any O
moment N
, O
because O
Harry H
Potter H
wasn't O
was O
n't O
a O
normal O
boy H
. O

As O
a O
matter N
of O
fact N
, O
he O
was O
as O
not O
normal O
as O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
be O
. O

Harry H
Potter H
was O
a O
wizard H
– O
a O
wizard H
fresh O
from O
his O
first O
year N
at O
Hogwarts O
School N
of O
Witchcraft N
and O
Wizardry N
. O

And O
if O
the O
Dursleys O
were O
unhappy O
to O
have O
him O
back O
for O
the O
holidays N
, O
it O
was O
nothing N
to O
how O
Harry H
felt N
. O

He O
missed O
Hogwarts O
so O
much O
it O
was O
like O
having O
a O
constant O
stomach N
ache N
. O

All O
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
spellbooks O
, O
his O
wand N
, O
robes N
, O
cauldron N
and O
top-of-the-range O
Nimbus O
Two O
Thousand O
broomstick N
had O
been O
locked O
in O
a O
cupboard N
under O
the O
stairs N
by O
Uncle H
Vernon H
the O
instant O
Harry H
had O
come O
home N
. O

What O
did O
the O
Dursleys O
care N
if O
Harry H
lost O
his O
place N
in O
the O
house N
Quidditch O
team N
because O
he O
hadn't O
had O
n't O
practised O
all O
summer N
? O

What O
was O
it O
to O
the O
Dursleys O
if O
Harry H
went O
back O
to O
school N
without O
any O
of O
his O
homework N
done O
? O

The O
Dursleys O
were O
what O
wizards H
called O
Muggles O
( O
not O
a O
drop O
of O
magical O
blood N
in O
their O
veins N
) O
and O
as O
far O
as O
they O
were O
concerned O
, O
having O
a O
wizard H
in O
the O
family H
was O
a O
matter N
of O
deepest O
shame N
. O

Uncle H
Vernon H
had O
even O
padlocked O
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
owl A
, O
Hedwig O
, O
inside O
her O
cage N
, O
to O
stop N
her O
carrying O
messages N
to O
anyone O
in O
the O
wizarding O
world N
. O

Harry H
looked O
nothing N
like O
the O
rest N
of O
the O
family H
. O

Uncle H
Vernon H
was O
large O
and O
neckless O
, O
with O
an O
enormous O
black O
moustache N
; O
Aunt H
Petunia O
was O
horse-faced O
and O
bony O
; O
Dudley H
was O
blond O
, O
pink O
and O
porky O
. O

Harry H
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand N
, O
was O
small O
and O
skinny O
, O
with O
brilliant O
green O
eyes N
and O
jet-black O
hair N
that O
was O
always O
untidy O
. O

He O
wore O
round O
glasses N
, O
and O
on O
his O
forehead N
was O
a O
thin O
, O
lightning-shaped O
scar N
. O

It O
was O
this O
scar N
that O
made O
Harry H
so O
particularly O
unusual O
, O
even O
for O
a O
wizard H
. O

This O
scar N
was O
the O
only O
hint O
of O
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
very O
mysterious O
past N
, O
of O
the O
reason N
he O
had O
been O
left O
on O
the O
Dursleys O
doorstep N
eleven O
years N
before O
. O

At O
the O
age N
of O
one N
, O
Harry H
had O
somehow O
survived O
a O
curse O
from O
the O
greatest O
dark O
sorcerer H
of O
all O
time N
, O
Lord A
Voldemort O
, O
whose O
name N
most O
witches H
and O
wizards H
still O
feared O
to O
speak O
. O

Harry's O
Harry H
's H
parents H
had O
died O
in O
Voldemort's O
Voldemort O
's H
attack N
, O
but O
Harry H
had O
escaped O
with O
his O
lightning N
scar N
, O
and O
somehow O
– O
nobody H
understood O
why O
– O
Voldemort's O
Voldemort O
's H
powers N
had O
been O
destroyed O
the O
instant O
he O
had O
failed O
to O
kill O
Harry H
. O

So O
Harry H
had O
been O
brought O
up O
by O
his O
dead O
mother's O
mother H
's H
sister H
and O
her O
husband H
. O

He O
had O
spent O
ten O
years N
with O
the O
Dursleys O
, O
never O
understanding N
why O
he O
kept O
making O
odd O
things N
happen O
without O
meaning N
to O
, O
believing O
the O
Dursleys O
story N
that O
he O
had O
got O
his O
scar N
in O
the O
car N
crash O
which O
had O
killed O
his O
parents H
. O

And O
then O
, O
exactly O
a O
year N
ago O
, O
Hogwarts O
had O
written O
to O
Harry H
, O
and O
the O
whole O
story N
had O
come O
out O
. O

Harry H
had O
taken O
up O
his O
place N
at O
wizard H
school N
, O
where O
he O
and O
his O
scar N
were O
famous O
, O
but O
now O
the O
school N
year N
was O
over O
, O
and O
he O
was O
back O
with O
the O
Dursleys O
for O
the O
summer N
, O
back O
to O
being O
treated O
like O
a O
dog A
that O
had O
rolled O
in O
something O
smelly O
. O

The O
Dursleys O
hadn't O
had O
n't O
even O
remembered O
that O
today N
happened O
to O
be O
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
twelfth O
birthday N
. O

of O
course N
, O
his O
hopes N
hadn't O
had O
n't O
been O
high O
; O
they'd O
they O
'd O
never O
given O
him O
a O
proper O
present N
, O
let O
alone O
a O
cake N
– O
but O
to O
ignore O
it O
completely O
. O

Harry H
looked O
up O
, O
hardly O
daring O
to O
believe O
it O
. O

This O
could O
well O
be O
the O
day N
I H
make O
the O
biggest O
deal O
of O
my H
career N
, O
said O
Uncle H
Vernon H
. O

Harry H
went O
back O
to O
his O
toast O
. O

of O
course N
, O
he O
thought O
bitterly O
, O
Uncle H
Vernon H
was O
talking O
about O
the O
stupid O
dinner N
party N
. O

He'd O
He O
'd O
been O
talking O
of O
nothing N
else O
for O
a O
fortnight N
. O

Some O
rich O
builder N
and O
his O
wife H
were O
coming O
to O
dinner N
and O
Uncle H
Vernon H
was O
hoping O
to O
get O
a O
huge O
order O
from O
him O
( O
Uncle H
Vernon's O
Vernon H
's H
company N
made O
drills N
) O
. O

Good O
, O
good O
. O

Dudley H
put O
on O
a O
foul N
, O
simpering O
smile O
. O

Excellent O
, O
Dudley H
, O
said O
Uncle H
Vernon H
. O

Then O
he O
rounded O
on O
Harry H
. O

At O
eight O
fifteen O
– O

And O
you H
? O
said O
Uncle H
Vernon H
viciously O
to O
Harry H
. O

Now O
, O
we H
should O
aim N
to O
get O
in O
a O
few O
good O
compliments N
at O
dinner N
. O

Do O
tell O
me H
where O
you H
bought O
your H
dress O
, O
Mrs N
Mason H

This O
was O
too O
much O
for O
both O
Aunt H
Petunia O
and O
Harry H
. O

Aunt H
Petunia O
burst O
into O
tears N
and O
hugged O
her O
son H
, O
while O
Harry H
ducked O
under O
the O
table N
so O
they O
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
see O
him O
laughing O
. O

Harry H
fought O
to O
keep O
his O
face N
straight O
as O
he O
emerged O
. O

Too O
right O
you H
will O
, O
said O
Uncle H
Vernon H
forcefully O
. O

When O
dinner's O
dinner N
's H
over O
, O
you H
take O
Mrs N
Mason H
back O
to O
the O
lounge N
for O
coffee N
, O
Petunia O
, O
and O
I'll O
I H
'll O
bring O
the O
subject O
round O
to O
drills N
. O

With O
any O
luck N
, O
I'll O
I H
'll O
have O
the O
deal O
signed O
and O
sealed O
before O
the O
News O
at O
Ten O
. O

Harry H
couldn't O
could O
n't O
feel O
too O
excited O
about O
this O
. O

He O
didn't O
did O
n't O
think O
the O
Dursleys O
would O
like O
him O
any O
better O
in O
Majorca O
than O
they O
did O
in O
Privet O
Drive O
. O

Harry H
left O
through O
the O
back O
door N
. O

It O
was O
a O
brilliant O
, O
sunny O
day N
. O

He O
crossed O
the O
lawn N
, O
slumped O
down O
on O
the O
garden N
bench N
, O
and O
sang O
under O
his O
breath N
: O
" O
Happy O
birthday N
to O
me H
. O
Happy O
birthday N
to O
me H
" O

No O
cards N
, O
no O
presents O
, O
and O
he O
would O
be O
spending N
the O
evening N
pretending O
not O
to O
exist O
. O

He O
gazed O
miserably O
into O
the O
hedge N
. O

He O
had O
never O
felt N
so O
lonely O
. O

More O
than O
anything O
else O
at O
Hogwarts O
, O
more O
even O
than O
playing O
Quidditch O
, O
Harry H
missed O
his O
best O
friends H
, O
Ron H
Weasley O
and O
Hermione O
Granger O
. O

They O
, O
however O
, O
didn't O
did O
n't O
seem O
to O
be O
missing O
him O
at O
all O
. O

Neither O
of O
them O
had O
written O
to O
him O
all O
summer N
, O
even O
though O
Ron H
had O
said O
he O
was O
going O
to O
ask O
Harry H
to O
come O
and O
stay O
. O

Countless O
times N
, O
Harry H
had O
been O
on O
the O
point N
of O
unlocking O
Hedwig's O
Hedwig O
's H
cage N
by O
magic N
and O
sending O
her O
to O
Ron H
and O
Hermione O
with O
a O
letter N
, O
but O
it O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
worth N
the O
risk N
. O

Underage O
wizards H
weren't O
were O
n't O
allowed O
to O
use O
magic N
outside O
school N
. O

Harry H
hadn't O
had O
n't O
told O
the O
Dursleys O
this O
; O
he O
knew O
it O
was O
only O
their O
terror N
that O
he O
might O
turn O
them O
all O
into O
dung O
beetles A
that O
stopped O
them O
locking O
him O
in O
the O
cupboard N
under O
the O
stairs N
with O
his O
wand N
and O
broomstick N
. O

For O
the O
first O
couple N
of O
weeks N
back O
, O
Harry H
had O
enjoyed O
muttering O
nonsense N
words N
under O
his O
breath N
and O
watching O
Dudley H
tearing O
out O
of O
the O
room N
as O
fast O
as O
his O
fat O
legs N
would O
carry O
him O
. O

But O
the O
long O
silence N
from O
Ron H
and O
Hermione O
had O
made O
Harry H
feel O
so O
cut O
off O
from O
the O
magical O
world N
that O
even O
taunting O
Dudley H
had O
lost O
its O
appeal O
– O
and O
now O
Ron H
and O
Hermione O
had O
forgotten O
his O
birthday N
. O

What O
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
he O
give O
now O
for O
a O
message N
from O
Hogwarts O
? O

From O
any O
witch O
or O
wizard H
? O

He'd O
He O
'd O
almost O
be O
glad O
of O
a O
sight N
of O
his O
arch-enemy O
, O
Draco O
Malfoy O
, O
just O
to O
be O
sure O
it O
hadn't O
had O
n't O
all O
been O
a O
dream O
. O

Not O
that O
his O
whole O
year N
at O
Hogwarts O
had O
been O
fun O
. O

At O
the O
very O
end N
of O
last O
term N
, O
Harry H
had O
come O
face N
to O
face N
with O
none N
other O
than O
Lord A
Voldemort O
himself O
. O

Voldemort O
might O
be O
a O
ruin N
of O
his O
former O
self O
, O
but O
he O
was O
still O
terrifying O
, O
still O
cunning O
, O
still O
determined O
to O
regain O
power N
. O

Harry H
had O
slipped O
through O
Voldemort's O
Voldemort O
's H
clutches N
for O
a O
second N
time N
, O
but O
it O
had O
been O
a O
narrow O
escape O
, O
and O
even O
now O
, O
weeks N
later O
, O
Harry H
kept O
waking O
in O
the O
night N
, O
drenched O
in O
cold O
sweat O
, O
wondering O
where O
Voldemort O
was O
now O
, O
remembering O
his O
livid O
face N
, O
his O
wide O
, O
mad O
eyes N
. O

Harry H
suddenly O
sat O
bolt O
upright O
on O
the O
garden N
bench N
. O

He O
had O
been O
staring O
absent-mindedly O
into O
the O
hedge N
– O
and O
the O
hedge N
was O
staring O
back O
. O

Two O
enormous O
green O
eyes N
had O
appeared O
among O
the O
leaves N
. O

Harry H
jumped O
to O
his O
feet N
just O
as O
a O
jeering O
voice H
floated O
across O
the O
lawn N
. O

The O
huge O
eyes N
blinked O
and O
vanished O
. O

So O
you've O
you H
've O
finally O
learned O
the O
days N
of O
the O
week N
. O

Dudley H
hitched O
up O
his O
trousers N
, O
which O
were O
slipping O
down O
his O
fat O
bottom N
. O

Why're O
Why O
're O
you H
staring O
at O
the O
hedge N
? O
he O
said O
suspiciously O
. O

Dudley H
stumbled O
backwards O
at O
once O
, O
a O
look O
of O
panic O
on O
his O
fat O
face N
. O

MUUUUUUM O
! O
howled O
Dudley H
, O
tripping O
over O
his O
feet N
as O
he O
dashed O
back O
towards O
the O
house N
. O

Harry H
paid O
dearly O
for O
his O
moment N
of O
fun O
. O

As O
neither O
Dudley H
nor O
the O
hedge N
was O
in O
any O
way N
hurt O
, O
Aunt H
Petunia O
knew O
he O
hadn't O
had O
n't O
really O
done O
magic N
, O
but O
he O
still O
had O
to O
duck A
as O
she O
aimed O
a O
heavy O
blow O
at O
his O
head N
with O
the O
soapy O
frying O
pan N
. O

Then O
she O
gave O
him O
work N
to O
do O
, O
with O
the O
promise N
he O
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
eat O
again O
until O
he'd O
he O
'd O
finished O
. O

While O
Dudley H
lolled O
around O
watching O
and O
eating O
ice-creams O
, O
Harry H
cleaned O
the O
windows N
, O
washed O
the O
car N
, O
mowed O
the O
lawn N
, O
trimmed O
the O
flowerbeds N
, O
pruned O
and O
watered O
the O
roses A
and O
repainted O
the O
garden N
bench N
. O

The O
sun N
blazed O
overhead N
, O
burning O
the O
back O
of O
his O
neck N
. O

Harry H
knew O
he O
shouldn't O
should O
n't O
have O
risen O
to O
Dudley's O
Dudley H
's H
bait N
, O
but O
Dudley H
had O
said O
the O
very O
thing N
Harry H
had O
been O
thinking O
himself O
maybe O
he O
didn't O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
friends H
at O
Hogwarts O

Wish O
they O
could O
see O
famous O
Harry H
Potter H
now O
, O
he O
thought O
savagely O
, O
as O
he O
spread O
manure N
on O
the O
flower A
beds N
, O
his O
back O
aching O
, O
sweat O
running O
down O
his O
face N
. O

Harry H
moved O
gladly O
into O
the O
shade N
of O
the O
gleaming O
kitchen N
. O

On O
top N
of O
the O
fridge N
stood O
tonight's O
tonight N
's H
pudding N
: O
a O
huge O
mound N
of O
whipped O
cream N
and O
sugared O
violets A
. O

A O
joint O
of O
roast O
pork N
was O
sizzling O
in O
the O
oven N
. O

Eat O
quickly O
! O

She O
was O
already O
wearing O
a O
salmon-pink O
cocktail N
dress O
. O

Harry H
washed O
his O
hands N
and O
bolted O
down O
his O
pitiful O
supper N
. O

The O
moment N
he O
had O
finished O
, O
Aunt H
Petunia O
whisked O
away O
his O
plate N
. O

As O
he O
passed O
the O
door N
to O
the O
living O
room N
, O
Harry H
caught O
a O
glimpse N
of O
Uncle H
Vernon H
and O
Dudley H
in O
bow-ties N
and O
dinner N
jackets N
. O

He O
had O
only O
just O
reached O
the O
upstairs O
landing N
when O
the O
door N
bell N
rang O
and O
Uncle H
Vernon's O
Vernon H
's H
furious O
face N
appeared O
at O
the O
foot N
of O
the O
stairs N
. O

Harry H
crossed O
to O
his O
bedroom N
on O
tiptoe N
, O
slipped O
inside O
, O
closed O
the O
door N
and O
turned O
to O
collapse N
on O
his O
bed N
. O

The O
trouble N
was O
, O
there O
was O
already O
someone H
sitting O
on O
it O
. O

Harry H
managed O
not O
to O
shout N
out O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
close O
thing N
. O

The O
little O
creature A
on O
the O
bed N
had O
large O
, O
bat-like O
ears N
and O
bulging O
green O
eyes N
the O
size N
of O
tennis N
balls N
. O

Harry H
knew O
instantly O
that O
this O
was O
what O
had O
been O
watching O
him O
out O
of O
the O
garden N
hedge N
that O
morning N
. O

As O
they O
stared O
at O
each O
other O
, O
Harry H
heard O
Dudley's O
Dudley H
's H
voice H
from O
the O
hall N
. O

May O
I H
take O
your H
coats N
, O
Mr N
and O
Mrs N
Mason H
? O

The O
creature A
slipped O
off O
the O
bed N
and O
bowed O
so O
low O
that O
the O
end N
of O
its O
long O
thin O
nose N
touched O
the O
carpet N
. O

Harry H
noticed O
that O
it O
was O
wearing O
what O
looked O
like O
an O
old O
pillowcase N
, O
with O
rips N
for O
arm N
and O
leg N
holes N
. O

Th-thank O
you H
, O
said O
Harry H
, O
edging O
along O
the O
wall N
and O
sinking O
into O
his O
desk N
chair N
, O
next O
to O
Hedwig O
, O
who O
was O
asleep O
in O
her O
large O
cage N
. O

Just O
Dobby O
. O

Er O
– O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
rude O
or O
anything O
, O
but O
– O
this O
isn't O
is O
n't O
a O
great O
time N
for O
me H
to O
have O
a O
house-elf O
in O
my H
bedroom N
. O

Aunt H
Petunias O
high O
, O
false O
laugh O
sounded O
from O
the O
living O
room N
. O

The O
elf A
hung O
his O
head N
. O

People N
goggled O
through O
the O
bars N
at O
him O
as O
he O
lay O
, O
starving O
and O
weak O
, O
on O
a O
bed N
of O
straw N
. O

Then O
the O
Dursleys O
appeared O
and O
Dudley H
rattled O
the O
bars N
of O
the O
cage N
, O
laughing O
at O
him O
. O

Leave O
me H
alone O
. O
Cut O
it O
out O
. O
I'm O
I H
'm O
trying O
to O
sleep O
. O

He O
opened O
his O
eyes N
. O

Moonlight N
was O
shining O
through O
the O
bars N
on O
the O
window N
. O

And O
someone H
was O
goggling O
through O
the O
bars N
at O
him O
: O
a O
freckle-faced O
, O
red-haired O
, O
long-nosed O
someone H
. O

Ron H
Weasley O
was O
outside O
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
window N
. O

Harry's O
Harry H
's H
mouth N
fell O
open O
as O
the O
full O
impact N
of O
what O
he O
was O
seeing O
hit O
him O
. O

Ron H
was O
leaning O
out O
of O
the O
back O
window N
of O
an O
old O
turquoise N
car N
, O
which O
was O
parked O
in O
mid-air O
. O

Grinning O
at O
Harry H
from O
the O
front N
seats N
were O
Fred H
and O
George H
, O
Ron's O
Ron H
's H
elder H
twin H
brothers H
. O

Why O
haven't O
have O
n't O
you H
been O
answering O
my H
letters N
? O

Bit N
rich O
coming O
from O
you H
, O
said O
Harry H
, O
staring O
at O
the O
floating O
car N
. O

Stop O
gibbering O
, O
said O
Ron H
, O
we've O
we H
've O
come O
to O
take O
you H
home N
with O
us H
. O

If O
the O
Dursleys O
wake O
up O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
dead O
, O
said O
Harry H
as O
he O
tied O
the O
rope N
tightly O
around O
a O
bar N
and O
Fred H
revved O
up O
the O
car N
. O

Harry H
moved O
back O
into O
the O
shadows N
next O
to O
Hedwig O
, O
who O
seemed O
to O
have O
realised O
how O
important O
this O
was O
and O
kept O
still O
and O
silent O
. O

The O
car N
revved O
louder O
and O
louder O
and O
suddenly O
, O
with O
a O
crunching O
noise N
, O
the O
bars N
were O
pulled O
clean O
out O
of O
the O
window N
as O
Fred H
drove O
straight O
up O
in O
the O
air N
– O
Harry H
ran O
back O
to O
the O
window N
to O
see O
the O
bars N
dangling O
a O
few O
feet N
above O
the O
ground N
. O

Panting O
, O
Ron H
hoisted O
them O
up O
into O
the O
car N
. O

Harry H
listened O
anxiously O
, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
sound N
from O
the O
Dursleys O
bedroom N
. O

When O
the O
bars N
were O
safely O
in O
the O
back O
seat N
with O
Ron H
, O
Fred H
reversed O
as O
close O
as O
possible O
to O
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
window N
. O

Locked O
in O
the O
cupboard N
under O
the O
stairs N
, O
and O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
get O
out O
of O
this O
room N
– O

Fred H
and O
George H
climbed O
carefully O
through O
the O
window N
into O
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
room N
. O

You H
had O
to O
hand N
it O
to O
them O
, O
thought O
Harry H
, O
as O
George H
took O
an O
ordinary O
hairpin N
from O
his O
pocket N
and O
started O
to O
pick O
the O
lock O
. O

There O
was O
a O
small O
click O
and O
the O
door N
swung O
open O
. O

Watch O
out O
for O
the O
bottom N
stair N
, O
it O
creaks O
, O
Harry H
whispered O
back O
, O
as O
the O
twins H
disappeared O
onto O
the O
dark O
landing N
. O

Harry H
dashed O
around O
his O
room N
, O
collecting O
his O
things N
together O
and O
passing O
them O
out O
of O
the O
window N
to O
Ron H
. O

Then O
he O
went O
to O
help O
Fred H
and O
George H
heave O
his O
trunk N
up O
the O
stairs N
. O

Harry H
heard O
Uncle H
Vernon H
cough O
. O

At O
last O
, O
panting O
, O
they O
reached O
the O
landing N
, O
then O
carried O
the O
trunk N
through O
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
room N
to O
the O
open O
window N
. O

Fred H
climbed O
back O
into O
the O
car N
to O
pull O
with O
Ron H
, O
and O
Harry H
and O
George H
pushed O
from O
the O
bedroom N
side N
. O

Inch N
by O
inch N
, O
the O
trunk N
slid O
through O
the O
window N
. O

Uncle H
Vernon H
coughed O
again O
. O

Harry H
and O
George H
threw O
their O
shoulders N
against O
the O
trunk N
and O
it O
slid O
out O
of O
the O
window N
into O
the O
back O
seat N
of O
the O
car N
. O

But O
as O
Harry H
climbed O
onto O
the O
window-sill O
there O
came O
a O
sudden O
loud O
screech N
from O
behind O
him O
, O
followed O
immediately O
by O
the O
thunder N
of O
Uncle H
Vernon's O
Vernon H
's H
voice H
. O

Harry H
tore O
back O
across O
the O
room N
as O
the O
landing N
light N
clicked O
on O
. O

He O
snatched O
up O
Hedwig's O
Hedwig O
's H
cage N
, O
dashed O
to O
the O
window N
and O
passed O
it O
out O
to O
Ron H
. O

He O
was O
scrambling O
back O
onto O
the O
chest N
of O
drawers N
when O
Uncle H
Vernon H
hammered O
on O
the O
unlocked O
door N
– O
and O
it O
crashed O
open O
. O

For O
a O
split O
second N
, O
Uncle H
Vernon H
stood O
framed O
in O
the O
doorway N
; O
then O
he O
let O
out O
a O
bellow N
like O
an O
angry O
bull A
and O
dived O
at O
Harry H
, O
grabbing O
him O
by O
the O
ankle N
. O

Ron H
, O
Fred H
and O
George H
seized O
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
arms N
and O
pulled O
as O
hard O
as O
they O
could O
. O

Petunia O
! O
roared O
Uncle H
Vernon H
. O

But O
the O
Weasleys O
gave O
a O
gigantic O
tug N
and O
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
leg N
slid O
out O
of O
Uncle H
Vernon's O
Vernon H
's H
grasp O
. O

Harry H
couldn't O
could O
n't O
believe O
it O
– O
he O
was O
free O
. O

He O
wound N
down O
the O
window N
, O
the O
night N
air N
whipping O
his O
hair N
, O
and O
looked O
back O
at O
the O
shrinking O
rooftops N
of O
Privet O
Drive O
. O

Uncle H
Vernon H
, O
Aunt H
Petunia O
, O
and O
Dudley H
were O
all O
hanging O
, O
dumbstruck O
, O
out O
of O
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
window N
. O

The O
Weasleys O
roared O
with O
laughter N
and O
Harry H
settled O
back O
in O
his O
seat N
, O
grinning O
from O
ear N
to O
ear N
. O

Let O
Hedwig O
out O
, O
he O
told O
Ron H
. O
She O
can O
fly O
behind O
us H
. O

George H
handed O
the O
hairpin N
to O
Ron H
and O
a O
moment N
later O
, O
Hedwig O
had O
soared O
joyfully O
out O
of O
the O
window N
to O
glide O
alongside O
them O
like O
a O
ghost H
. O

Harry H
told O
them O
all O
about O
Dobby O
, O
the O
warning N
he'd O
he O
'd O
given O
Harry H
and O
the O
fiasco N
of O
the O
violet N
pudding N
. O

There O
was O
a O
long O
shocked O
silence N
when O
he O
had O
finished O
. O

" O
Definitely O
dodgy O
" O
agreed O
George H
. O

He O
saw O
Fred H
and O
George H
look O
at O
each O
other O
. O

Well O
, O
said O
Fred H
, O
put O
it O
this O
way N
– O
house-elves O
have O
got O
powerful O
magic N
of O
their O
own O
, O
but O
they O
can't O
ca O
n't O
usually O
use O
it O
without O
their O
master's O
master O
's H
permission N
. O

I H
reckon O
old O
Dobby O
was O
sent O
to O
stop N
you H
coming O
back O
to O
Hogwarts O
. O

Someone's O
Someone O
's H
idea N
of O
a O
joke N
. O

Draco O
Malfoy O
? O
said O
George H
, O
turning O
around O
. O

He O
was O
a O
big O
supporter H
of O
You H
Know O
Who O
. O

Harry H
had O
heard O
these O
rumours N
about O
Malfoy's O
Malfoy O
's H
family H
before O
, O
and O
they O
didn't O
did O
n't O
surprise O
him O
at O
all O
. O

Draco O
Malfoy O
made O
Dudley H
Dursley O
look O
like O
a O
kind N
, O
thoughtful O
and O
sensitive O
boy H
. O

Yeah O
, O
Mum's O
Mum H
's H
always O
wishing O
we H
had O
a O
house-elf O
to O
do O
the O
ironing O
, O
said O
George H
. O

Harry H
was O
silent O
. O

Judging O
by O
the O
fact N
that O
Draco O
Malfoy O
usually O
had O
the O
best O
of O
everything O
, O
his O
family H
were O
rolling O
in O
wizard H
gold N
; O
he O
could O
just O
see O
Malfoy O
strutting O
around O
a O
large O
manor N
house N
. O

Sending O
the O
family H
servant H
to O
stop N
Harry H
from O
going O
back O
to O
Hogwarts O
also O
sounded O
exactly O
like O
the O
sort N
of O
thing N
Malfoy O
would O
do O
. O

Had O
Harry H
been O
stupid O
to O
take O
Dobby O
seriously O
? O

I H
thought O
it O
was O
Errol's O
Errol O
's H
fault N
at O
first O
– O

He's O
He O
's H
ancient O
. O

It O
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
be O
the O
first O
time N
he'd O
he O
'd O
collapsed O
on O
a O
delivery N
. O

The O
owl A
Mum H
and O
Dad H
bought O
Percy H
when O
he O
was O
made O
a O
prefect H
, O
said O
Fred H
from O
the O
front N
. O

I H
mean O
, O
there's O
there O
's H
only O
so O
many O
times N
you H
can O
polish N
a O
prefect H
badge N
. O

You're O
You H
're O
driving O
too O
far O
west O
, O
Fred H
, O
he O
added O
, O
pointing O
at O
a O
compass N
on O
the O
dashboard N
. O

Fred H
twiddled O
the O
steering N
wheel N
. O

He O
works O
in O
the O
most O
boring O
department N
, O
said O
Ron H
. O

Like O
, O
last O
year N
, O
some O
old O
witch O
died O
and O
her O
tea N
set O
was O
sold O
to O
an O
antiques N
shop N
. O

This O
Muggle O
woman H
bought O
it O
, O
took O
it O
home N
and O
tried O
to O
serve O
her O
friends H
tea N
in O
it O
. O

What O
happened O
? O

Fred H
laughed O
. O

He O
takes O
it O
apart O
, O
puts O
spells N
on O
it O
and O
puts O
it O
back O
together O
again O
. O

If O
he O
raided O
our H
house N
he'd O
he O
'd O
have O
to O
put O
himself O
straight O
under O
arrest N
. O

It O
drives O
Mum H
mad O
. O

A O
faint O
pinkish O
glow N
was O
visible O
along O
the O
horizon N
to O
the O
east O
. O

Fred H
brought O
the O
car N
lower O
and O
Harry H
saw O
a O
dark O
patchwork N
of O
fields N
and O
clumps N
of O
trees A
. O

Lower O
and O
lower O
went O
the O
flying O
car N
. O

The O
edge N
of O
a O
brilliant O
red O
sun N
was O
now O
gleaming O
through O
the O
trees A
. O

Touchdown N
! O
said O
Fred H
as O
, O
with O
a O
slight O
bump N
, O
they O
hit O
the O
ground N
. O

They O
had O
landed O
next O
to O
a O
tumbledown O
garage N
in O
a O
small O
yard N
and O
Harry H
looked O
out O
for O
the O
first O
time N
at O
Ron's O
Ron H
's H
house N
. O

It O
looked O
as O
though O
it O
had O
once O
been O
a O
large O
stone N
pigsty N
, O
but O
extra O
rooms N
had O
been O
added O
here O
and O
there O
until O
it O
was O
several O
storeys N
high O
and O
so O
crooked O
it O
looked O
as O
though O
it O
was O
held O
up O
by O
magic N
( O
which O
, O
Harry H
reminded O
himself O
, O
it O
probably O
was O
) O
. O

Four O
or O
five O
chimneys N
were O
perched O
on O
top N
of O
the O
red O
roof N
. O

Round N
the O
front N
door N
lay O
a O
jumble N
of O
wellington H
boots N
and O
a O
very O
rusty O
cauldron N
. O

Several O
fat O
brown O
chickens N
were O
pecking O
their O
way N
around O
the O
yard N
. O

They O
got O
out O
of O
the O
car N
. O

Then O
, O
Ron H
, O
you H
come O
bounding O
downstairs O
going O
, O
Mum H
, O
look O
who O
turned O
up O
in O
the O
night N
! O
and O
she'll O
she O
'll O
be O
all O
pleased O
to O
see O
Harry H
and O
no O
one N
need O
ever O
know O
we H
flew O
the O
car N
. O

Ron H
had O
gone O
a O
nasty O
greenish O
colour N
, O
his O
eyes N
fixed O
on O
the O
house N
. O

The O
other O
three O
wheeled O
around O
. O

Mrs N
Weasley O
was O
marching O
across O
the O
yard N
, O
scattering O
chickens N
, O
and O
for O
a O
short O
, O
plump O
, O
kind-faced O
woman H
, O
it O
was O
remarkable O
how O
much O
she O
looked O
like O
a O
saber-toothed O
tiger A
. O

Mrs N
Weasley O
came O
to O
a O
halt N
in O
front N
of O
them O
, O
her O
hands N
on O
her O
hips N
, O
staring O
from O
one N
guilty O
face N
to O
the O
next O
. O

She O
was O
wearing O
a O
flowered O
apron N
with O
a O
wand N
sticking O
out O
of O
the O
pocket N
. O

So O
, O
she O
said O
. O

All O
three O
of O
Mrs N
Weasley's O
Weasley O
's H
sons H
were O
taller O
than O
she O
was O
, O
but O
they O
cowered O
as O
her O
rage O
broke O
over O
them O
. O

No O
note N
! O

Car N
gone O
could O
have O
crashed O
out O
of O
my H
mind N
with O
worry O
did O
you H
care N
? O
never O
, O
as O
long O
as O
I've O
I H
've O
lived O
you H
wait N
until O
your H
father H
gets O
home N
, O
we H
never O
had O
trouble N
like O
this O
from O
Bill H
or O
Charlie H
or O
Percy H

It O
seemed O
to O
go O
on O
for O
hours N
. O

Mrs N
Weasley O
had O
shouted O
herself O
hoarse O
before O
she O
turned O
on O
Harry H
, O
who O
backed O
away O
. O

Come O
in O
and O
have O
some O
breakfast N
. O

She O
turned O
and O
walked O
back O
into O
the O
house N
and O
Harry H
, O
after O
a O
nervous O
glance N
at O
Ron H
, O
who O
nodded O
encouragingly O
, O
followed O
her O
. O

The O
kitchen N
was O
small O
and O
rather O
cramped O
. O

There O
was O
a O
scrubbed O
wooden O
table N
and O
chairs N
in O
the O
middle O
and O
Harry H
sat O
down O
on O
the O
edge N
of O
his O
seat N
, O
looking O
around O
. O

He O
had O
never O
been O
in O
a O
wizard H
house N
before O
. O

The O
clock N
on O
the O
wall N
opposite N
him O
had O
only O
one N
hand N
and O
no O
numbers N
at O
all O
. O

Books N
were O
stacked O
three O
deep O
on O
the O
mantelpiece N
, O
books N
with O
titles N
like O
Charm O
Your H
Own O
Cheese N
, O
Enchantment N
in O
Baking O
, O
and O
One O
Minute O
Feasts N
– O
It's O
It O
's H
Magic O
! O

Mrs N
Weasley O
was O
clattering O
around O
, O
cooking O
breakfast N
a O
little O
haphazardly O
, O
throwing O
dirty O
looks O
at O
her O
sons H
as O
she O
threw O
sausages N
into O
the O
frying O
pan N
. O

Arthur H
and O
I H
have O
been O
worried O
about O
you H
, O
too O
. O

Just O
last O
night N
we H
were O
saying O
we'd O
we H
'd O
come O
and O
get O
you H
ourselves H
if O
you H
hadn't O
had O
n't O
written O
back O
to O
Ron H
by O
Friday O
. O

She O
flicked O
her O
wand N
casually O
at O
the O
washing-up N
in O
the O
sink N
, O
which O
began O
to O
clean O
itself O
, O
clinking O
gently O
in O
the O
background N
. O

and O
you H
! O
said O
Mrs N
Weasley O
, O
but O
it O
was O
with O
a O
slightly O
softened O
expression N
that O
she O
started O
cutting N
Harry H
bread N
and O
buttering O
it O
for O
him O
. O

At O
that O
moment N
, O
there O
was O
a O
diversion N
in O
the O
form N
of O
a O
small O
, O
red-headed O
figure O
in O
a O
long O
nightdress N
, O
who O
appeared O
in O
the O
kitchen N
, O
gave O
a O
small O
squeal N
, O
and O
ran O
out O
again O
. O

Nothing N
more O
was O
said O
until O
all O
four O
plates N
were O
clean O
, O
which O
took O
a O
surprisingly O
short O
time N
. O

Blimey O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
tired O
, O
yawned O
Fred H
, O
setting N
down O
his O
knife N
and O
fork N
at O
last O
. O

Oh O
, O
Mum H
– O

That's O
That O
's H
very O
sweet O
of O
you H
, O
dear O
, O
but O
it's O
it O
's H
dull O
work N
, O
said O
Mrs N
Weasley O
. O

And O
she O
pulled O
a O
heavy O
book O
from O
the O
stack O
on O
the O
mantelpiece N
. O

George H
groaned O
. O

Harry H
looked O
at O
the O
cover O
of O
Mrs N
Weasley's O
Weasley O
's H
book O
. O

Written O
across O
it O
in O
fancy O
gold N
letters N
were O
the O
words N
: O
Gilderoy O
Lockhart's O
Lockhart O
's H
Guide O
to O
Household O
Pests N
. O

He'll O
He O
'll O
be O
fine O
, O
Molly H
, O
don't O
do O
n't O
fuss N
, O
said O
Mr N
Weasley O
, O
helping O
himself O
to O
Floo O
powder N
, O
too O
. O

Now O
, O
when O
you H
get O
into O
the O
fire N
, O
say O
where O
you're O
you H
're O
going O
– O

Or O
you H
might O
well O
fall N
out O
of O
the O
wrong O
fireplace N
– O

Trying O
hard O
to O
bear O
all O
this O
in O
mind N
, O
Harry H
took O
a O
pinch N
of O
Floo O
powder N
and O
walked O
to O
the O
edge N
of O
the O
fire N
. O

He O
took O
a O
deep O
breath N
, O
scattered O
the O
powder N
into O
the O
flames N
and O
stepped O
forward O
; O
the O
fire N
felt N
like O
a O
warm O
breeze N
; O
he O
opened O
his O
mouth N
and O
immediately O
swallowed O
a O
lot N
of O
hot O
ash N
. O

It O
felt N
as O
though O
he O
was O
being O
sucked O
down O
a O
giant A
plug N
hole N
. O

He O
seemed O
to O
be O
spinning N
very O
fast O

the O
roaring O
in O
his O
ears N
was O
deafening O

he O
tried O
to O
keep O
his O
eyes N
open O
but O
the O
whirl N
of O
green O
flames N
made O
him O
feel O
sick O

something O
hard O
knocked O
his O
elbow N
and O
he O
tucked O
it O
in O
tightly O
, O
still O
spinning N
and O
spinning N

now O
it O
felt N
as O
though O
cold O
hands N
were O
slapping O
his O
face N

squinting O
through O
his O
glasses N
he O
saw O
a O
blurred O
stream O
of O
fireplaces N
and O
snatched O
glimpses N
of O
the O
rooms N
beyond O

his O
bacon N
sandwiches N
were O
churning O
inside O
him O
. O

He O
closed O
his O
eyes N
again O
wishing O
it O
would O
stop N
, O
and O
then O
– O
he O
fell O
, O
face N
forward O
, O
onto O
cold O
stone N
and O
felt N
his O
glasses N
shatter O
. O

Dizzy O
and O
bruised O
, O
covered O
in O
soot N
, O
he O
got O
gingerly O
to O
his O
feet N
, O
holding O
his O
broken O
glasses N
up O
to O
his O
eyes N
. O

He O
was O
quite O
alone O
, O
but O
where O
he O
was O
, O
he O
had O
no O
idea N
. O

All O
he O
could O
tell O
was O
that O
he O
was O
standing N
in O
the O
stone N
fireplace N
of O
what O
looked O
like O
a O
large O
, O
dimly O
lit O
wizard's O
wizard H
's H
shop N
– O
but O
nothing N
in O
here O
was O
ever O
likely O
to O
be O
on O
a O
Hogwarts O
school N
list N
. O

A O
glass N
case N
nearby O
held O
a O
withered O
hand N
on O
a O
cushion N
, O
a O
blood-stained O
pack O
of O
cards N
, O
and O
a O
staring O
glass N
eye N
. O

Evil-looking O
masks N
stared O
down O
from O
the O
walls N
, O
an O
assortment N
of O
human O
bones N
lay O
upon O
the O
counter N
, O
and O
rusty O
, O
spiked O
instruments N
hung O
from O
the O
ceiling N
. O

Even O
worse O
, O
the O
dark O
, O
narrow O
street N
Harry H
could O
see O
through O
the O
dusty O
shop N
window N
was O
definitely O
not O
Diagon O
Alley O
. O

The O
sooner O
he O
got O
out O
of O
here O
, O
the O
better O
. O

Harry H
looked O
quickly O
around O
and O
spotted O
a O
large O
black O
cabinet N
to O
his O
left O
; O
he O
shot N
inside O
it O
and O
pulled O
the O
doors N
to O
leaving O
a O
small O
crack O
to O
peer H
through O
. O

Seconds N
later O
, O
a O
bell N
clanged O
, O
and O
Malfoy O
stepped O
into O
the O
shop N
. O

The O
man H
who O
followed O
could O
only O
be O
his O
father H
. O

He O
had O
the O
same O
pale O
, O
pointed O
face N
and O
identical O
cold O
grey O
eyes N
. O

I H
said O
I H
would O
buy O
you H
a O
racing N
broom N
, O
said O
his O
father H
, O
drumming O
his O
fingers N
on O
the O
counter N
. O

Special O
permission N
from O
Dumbledore O
so O
he O
could O
play O
for O
Gryffindor O
. O

Malfoy O
bent O
down O
to O
examine O
a O
shelf N
full O
of O
skulls N
. O

A O
stooping O
man H
had O
appeared O
behind O
the O
counter N
, O
smoothing O
his O
greasy O
hair N
back O
from O
his O
face N
. O

Mr N
Malfoy O
, O
what O
a O
pleasure N
to O
see O
you H
again O
, O
said O
Mr N
Borgin O
in O
a O
voice H
as O
oily O
as O
his O
hair N
. O

How O
may O
I H
be O
of O
assistance N
? O

The O
smile O
faded O
slightly O
from O
Mr N
Borgin's O
Borgin O
's H
face N
. O

You H
have O
heard O
, O
of O
course N
, O
that O
the O
Ministry O
is O
conducting O
more O
raids N
, O
said O
Mr N
Malfoy O
, O
taking O
a O
roll O
of O
parchment N
from O
his O
inside O
pocket N
and O
unravelling O
it O
for O
Mr N
Borgin O
to O
read O
. O

Mr N
Borgin O
fixed O
a O
pince-nez N
to O
his O
nose N
and O
looked O
down O
the O
list N
. O

Mr N
Malfoy's O
Malfoy O
's H
lip N
curled O
. O

The O
name N
Malfoy O
still O
commands N
a O
certain O
respect N
, O
yet O
the O
Ministry O
grows O
ever O
more O
meddlesome O
. O

Harry H
felt N
a O
hot O
surge N
of O
anger N
. O

– O
and O
as O
you H
see O
, O
certain O
of O
these O
poisons N
might O
make O
it O
appear O
– O

Insert O
a O
candle N
and O
it O
gives O
light N
only O
to O
the O
holder N
! O

Best O
friend H
of O
thieves H
and O
plunderers H
! O

The O
teachers H
all O
have O
favourites H
, O
that O
Hermione O
Granger O
– O

Not O
with O
me H
, O
said O
Mr N
Malfoy O
, O
his O
long O
nostrils N
flaring O
. O

They O
started O
to O
haggle O
. O

Harry H
watched O
nervously O
as O
Draco O
drew O
nearer O
and O
nearer O
to O
his O
hiding O
place N
, O
examining O
the O
objects N
for O
sale N
. O

He O
paused O
to O
examine O
a O
long O
coil N
of O
hangman's O
hangman H
's H
rope N
and O
to O
read O
, O
smirking O
, O
the O
card N
propped O
on O
a O
magnificent O
necklace N
of O
opals N
: O

Caution N
: O
Do O
Not O
Touch N
. O

Cursed O
– O
Has O
Claimed O
the O
Lives N
of O
Nineteen O
Muggle O
Owners H
to O
Date O
. O

Draco O
turned O
away O
and O
saw O
the O
cabinet N
right O
in O
front N
of O
him O
. O

He O
walked O
forward O
he O
stretched O
out O
his O
hand N
for O
the O
handle N

Come O
, O
Draco O
! O

Harry H
wiped O
his O
forehead N
on O
his O
sleeve N
as O
Draco O
turned O
away O
. O

The O
moment N
the O
door N
had O
closed O
, O
Mr N
Borgin O
dropped O
his O
oily O
manner N
. O

Muttering O
darkly O
, O
Mr N
Borgin O
disappeared O
into O
a O
back O
room N
. O

Harry H
waited O
for O
a O
minute O
in O
case N
he O
came O
back O
, O
then O
, O
quietly O
as O
he O
could O
, O
slipped O
out O
of O
the O
cabinet N
, O
past N
the O
glass N
cases N
, O
and O
out O
of O
the O
shop N
door N
. O

Clutching O
his O
broken O
glasses N
to O
his O
face N
he O
stared O
around O
. O

He O
had O
emerged O
into O
a O
dingy O
alleyway N
that O
seemed O
to O
be O
made O
up O
entirely O
of O
shops N
devoted O
to O
the O

The O
one N
he'd O
he O
'd O
just O
left O
, O
Borgin O
and O
Burkes O
, O
looked O
like O
the O
largest O
, O
but O
opposite N
was O
a O
nasty O
window N
display O
of O
shrunken O
heads N
, O
and O
two O
doors N
down O
, O
a O
large O
cage N
was O
alive O
with O
gigantic O
black O
spiders A
. O

Two O
shabby-looking O
wizards H
were O
watching O
him O
from O
the O
shadow N
of O
a O
doorway N
, O
muttering O
to O
each O
other O
. O

Feeling O
jumpy O
, O
Harry H
set O
off O
, O
trying O
to O
hold O
his O
glasses N
on O
straight O
and O
hoping O
against O
hope O
he'd O
he O
'd O
be O
able O
to O
find O
a O
way N
out O
of O
there O
. O

An O
old O
wooden O
street N
sign N
hanging O
over O
a O
shop N
selling O
poisonous O
candles N
told O
him O
he O
was O
in O
Knockturn O
Alley O
. O

This O
didn't O
did O
n't O
help O
, O
as O
Harry H
had O
never O
heard O
of O
such O
a O
place N
. O

He O
supposed O
he O
hadn't O
had O
n't O
spoken O
clearly O
enough O
through O
his O
mouthful N
of O
ashes N
back O
in O
the O
Weasleys O
fire N
. O

Trying O
to O
stay O
calm O
, O
he O
wondered O
what O
to O
do O
. O

An O
aged O
witch O
stood O
in O
front N
of O
him O
, O
holding O
a O
tray N
of O
what O
looked O
horribly O
like O
whole O
human O
fingernails N
. O

She O
leered O
at O
him O
, O
showing O
mossy O
teeth N
. O

Harry H
backed O
away O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
just O
– O

Harry's O
Harry H
's H
heart N
leapt O
. O

Hagrid O
seized O
Harry H
by O
the O
scruff N
of O
the O
neck N
and O
pulled O
him O
away O
from O
the O
witch O
, O
knocking O
the O
tray N
right O
out O
of O
her O
hands N
. O

Her O
shrieks N
followed O
them O
all O
the O
way N
along O
the O
twisting O
alleyway N
out O
into O
bright O
sunlight N
. O

Harry H
saw O
a O
familiar O
, O
snow-white O
marble N
building N
in O
the O
distance N
: O
Gringotts O
Bank N
. O

Hagrid O
had O
steered O
him O
right O
into O
Diagon O
Alley O
. O

Yer O
a O
mess N
! O
said O
Hagrid O
gruffly O
, O
brushing O
soot N
off O
Harry H
so O
forcefully O
he O
nearly O
knocked O
him O
into O
a O
barrel N
of O
dragon A
dung O
outside O
an O
apothecary's O
apothecary H
's H
. O

They're O
They O
're O
ruinin' O
the O
school N
cabbages N
. O

They O
set O
off O
together O
down O
the O
street N
. O

Harry H
explained O
all O
about O
Dobby O
and O
the O
Dursleys O
. O

Ruddy O
Muggles O
, O
growled O
Hagrid O
. O

Harry H
looked O
up O
and O
saw O
Hermione O
Granger O
standing N
at O
the O
top N
of O
the O
white O
flight N
of O
steps N
to O
Gringotts O
. O

She O
ran O
down O
to O
meet O
them O
, O
her O
bushy O
brown O
hair N
flying O
behind O
her O
. O

Hello O
, O
Hagrid O

Oh O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
wonderful O
to O
see O
you H
two O
again O

Are O
you H
coming O
into O
Gringotts O
, O
Harry H
? O

Harry H
and O
Hermione O
looked O
around O
: O
sprinting O
up O
the O
crowded O
street N
were O
Ron H
, O
Fred H
, O
George H
, O
Percy H
and O
Mr N
Weasley O
. O

He O
mopped O
his O
glistening O
bald O
patch N
. O

Molly's O
Molly H
's H
frantic O
– O
she's O
she O
's H
coming O
now O
. O

I H
should O
ruddy O
well O
think O
not O
, O
growled O
Hagrid O
. O

Mrs N
Weasley O
now O
came O
galloping O
into O
view N
, O
her O
handbag N
swinging O
wildly O
in O
one N
hand N
, O
Ginny O
just O
clinging O
onto O
the O
other O
. O

Gasping O
for O
breath N
she O
pulled O
a O
large O
clothes N
brush N
out O
of O
her O
bag N
and O
began O
sweeping O
off O
the O
soot N
Hagrid O
hadn't O
had O
n't O
managed O
to O
beat O
away O
. O

Mr N
Weasley O
took O
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
glasses N
, O
gave O
them O
a O
tap O
of O
his O
wand N
and O
returned O
them O
, O
good O
as O
new O
. O

And O
he O
strode O
away O
, O
head N
and O
shoulders N
taller O
than O
anyone O
else O
in O
the O
packed O
street N
. O

Guess O
who O
I H
saw O
in O
Borgin O
and O
Burkes O
? O
Harry H
asked O
Ron H
and O
Hermione O
as O
they O
climbed O
the O
Gringotts O
steps N
. O

Oh O
, O
I'd O
I H
'd O
love O
to O
get O
Lucius H
Malfoy O
for O
something O

What's O
What O
's H
that O
you've O
you H
've O
got O
there O
? O

Oh O
, O
you're O
you H
're O
changing O
Muggle O
money N
. O

Molly H
, O
look O
! O

He O
pointed O
excitedly O
at O
the O
tenpound O
notes N
in O
Mr N
Granger's O
Granger O
's H
hand N
. O

The O
vaults N
were O
reached O
by O
means N
of O
small O
, O
goblin-driven O
carts N
that O
sped O
along O
miniature O
train-tracks O
through O
the O
bank's O
bank N
's H
underground O
tunnels N
. O

Harry H
enjoyed O
the O
breakneck O
journey N
down O
to O
the O
Weasleys O
vault N
, O
but O
felt N
dreadful O
, O
far O
worse O
than O
he O
had O
in O
Knockturn O
Alley O
, O
when O
it O
was O
opened O
. O

There O
was O
a O
very O
small O
pile N
of O
silver N
Sickles N
inside O
, O
and O
just O
one N
gold N
Galleon N
. O

Mrs N
Weasley O
felt N
right O
into O
the O
corners N
before O
sweeping O
the O
whole O
lot N
into O
her O
bag N
. O

Harry H
felt N
even O
worse O
when O
they O
reached O
his O
vault N
. O

He O
tried O
to O
block O
the O
contents N
from O
view N
as O
he O
hastily O
shoved O
handfuls N
of O
coins N
into O
a O
leather N
bag N
. O

Back N
outside O
on O
the O
marble N
steps N
, O
they O
all O
separated O
. O

Percy H
muttered O
vaguely O
about O
needing O
a O
new O
quill N
. O

Fred H
and O
George H
had O
spotted O
their O
friend H
from O
Hogwarts O
, O
Lee H
Jordan H
. O

Mrs N
Weasley O
and O
Ginny O
were O
going O
to O
a O
second-hand O
robe N
shop N
. O
Mr N
Weasley O
was O
insisting O
on O
taking O
the O
Grangers O
off O
to O
the O
Leaky O
Cauldron O
for O
a O
drink N
. O

Harry H
, O
Ron H
and O
Hermione O
strolled O
off O
along O
the O
winding O
, O
cobbled O
street N
. O

The O
bag N
of O
gold N
, O
silver N
and O
bronze N
jangling O
cheerfully O
in O
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
pocket N
was O
clamouring O
to O
be O
spent O
, O
so O
he O
bought O
three O
large O
strawberry N
and O
peanut-butter O
ice-creams O
which O
they O
slurped O
happily O
as O
they O
wandered O
up O
the O
alley N
, O
examining O
the O
fascinating O
shop N
windows N
. O

A O
study O
of O
Hogwarts O
prefects H
and O
their O
later O
careers N
, O
Ron H
read O
aloud O
off O
the O
back O
cover O
. O

An O
hour N
later O
, O
they O
headed O
for O
Flourish O
and O
Blotts O
. O

They O
were O
by O
no O
means N
the O
only O
ones N
making O
their O
way N
to O
the O
bookshop N
. O

As O
they O
approached O
it O
, O
they O
saw O
to O
their O
surprise O
a O
large O
crowd N
jostling O
outside O
the O
doors N
, O
trying O
to O
get O
in O
. O

The O
reason N
for O
this O
was O
proclaimed O
by O
a O
large O
banner N
stretched O
across O
the O
upper O
windows N
: O

GILDEROY O
LOCKHART O
will O
be O
signing O
copies N
of O
his O
autobiography N
MAGICAL O
ME H
today N
12:30 O
to O
4:30 O
pm O
. O

I H
mean O
, O
he's O
he O
's H
written O
almost O
the O
whole O
booklist O
! O

Harry H
, O
Ron H
, O
and O
Hermione O
squeezed O
inside O
. O

A O
long O
line N
wound N
right O
to O
the O
back O
of O
the O
shop N
, O
where O
Gilderoy O
Lockhart O
was O
signing O
his O
books N
. O

They O
each O
grabbed O
a O
copy N
of O
Break N
with O
a O
Banshee A
, O
and O
sneaked O
up O
the O
line N
to O
where O
the O
rest N
of O
the O
Weasleys O
were O
standing N
with O
Mr N
and O
Mrs N
Granger O
. O

She O
sounded O
breathless O
and O
kept O
patting O
her O
hair N
. O

Gilderoy O
Lockhart O
came O
slowly O
into O
view N
, O
seated O
at O
a O
table N
surrounded O
by O
large O
pictures N
of O
his O
own O
face N
, O
all O
winking N
and O
flashing O
dazzlingly O
white O
teeth N
at O
the O
crowd N
. O

The O
real O
Lockhart O
was O
wearing O
robes N
of O
forget-me-not A
blue O
which O
exactly O
matched O
his O
eyes N
; O
his O
pointed O
wizard's O
wizard H
's H
hat N
was O
set O
at O
a O
jaunty O
angle N
on O
his O
wavy O
hair N
. O

A O
short O
, O
irritable-looking O
man H
was O
dancing N
around O
taking O
photographs N
with O
a O
large O
black O
camera N
that O
emitted O
puffs N
of O
purple N
smoke O
with O
every O
blinding O
flash N
. O

Yes O
, O
look O
at O
her O
, O
bunioned O
, O
bulbous O
, O
hair N
in O
bulrush A
rolls N
, O
butt-headed O
, O
butter-hearted O
and O
tenacious O
as O
a O
buckaroo H
. O

I H
had O
seen O
it O
happen O
to O
others O
. O

I H
did O
not O
want O
it O
to O
happen O
to O
me H
. O

Fate N
. O
A O
spin N
on O
the O
Wheel O
of O
Fortune O
and O
out O
I H
tumbled O
at O
Jove's O
Jove O
's H
feet N
. O

Another O
dizzy O
round O
, O
and O
there O
is O
Stella H
waiting O
to O
help O
me H
off O
. O

But O
who O
is O
turning O
the O
wheel N
? O

Honest O
Guv O
' O
I H
had O
both O
hands N
tied O
behind O
my H
back O
. O

Neither O
my H
mother H
nor O
my H
father H
were O
able O
to O
cope O
with O
the O
1960s N
. O

Skirts N
were O
too O
short O
, O
hair N
was O
too O
long O
, O
and O
the O
favoured O
colour N
combination N
of O
purple N
and O
orange N
made O
my H
mother H
look O
like O
a O
vampire A
and O
my H
father H
a O
Matisse O
. O

They O
were O
peculiarly O
ill-placed O
for O
the O
general O
assault N
on O
the O
past N
that O
the O
Sixties N
represented O
because O
they O
lived O
in O
Liverpool O
. O

Liverpool O
, O
that O
should O
have O
slumbered O
its O
way N
through O
the O
Sixties N
as O
it O
had O
every O
other O
decade N
, O
produced O
the O
Beatles O
. O

My H
parents H
were O
victims H
of O
the O
Merseybeat O
. O

I H
was O
born O
in O
a O
tug-boat O
. O

My H
mother H
whelped O
me H
in O
a O
mess N
of O
blankets N
while O
my H
noctivagant O
father H
towed O
in O
the O
big O
ships N
. O

Perhaps O
it O
was O
the O
seriousness N
of O
our H
business N
that O
pushed O
us H
both O
into O
laughter N
, O
extremes N
of O
emotion N
so O
easily O
tumbling O
into O
their O
opposites N
. O

Yet O
there O
was O
relief N
for O
us H
to O
find O
a O
human O
face N
behind O
the O
monster A
mask N
; O
the O
monster A
wife H
, O
the O
monster A
mistress H
, O
and O
what O
about O
the O
monster A
man H
? O

Tell O
the O
story N
as O
it O
happened O
. O

Why O
then O
did O
I H
trouble N
the O
surface N
? O

It O
was O
not O
myself H
I H
fell O
in O
love O
with O
it O
was O
her O
. O

' O
Are O
you H
waiting O
for O
someone H
? O
' O
I H
said O
. O

' O
I H
was O
. O
' O

' O
We're O
We H
're O
going O
to O
live O
in O
London O
, O
' O
he O
said O
. O

' O
Why O
Daddy O
? O
' O

' O
Because O
Daddy O
has O
a O
new O
job N
. O
' O

Grandmother H
was O
here O
, O
wrapped O
from O
head N
to O
foot N
in O
woollens N
, O
her O
face N
entirely O
obscured O
by O
a O
seaman's O
seaman H
's H
balaclava N
. O

She O
made O
us H
a O
cup N
of O
cocoa N
and O
my H
mother H
swept O
off O
in O
a O
taxi N
. O

I H
woke O
up O
in O
the O
dazed O
apartment N
. O

Next O
to O
me H
on O
the O
massacred O
bed N
, O
the O
order O
and O
beauty N
of O
her O
body N
. O

On O
the O
table N
beside O
, O
an O
amputated O
lamp N
. O

Across O
the O
room N
was O
a O
Snow N
Queen's O
Queen O
's H
mirror N
, O
its O
pieces N
scatters N
of O
despair N
. O

I H
crept O
from O
beneath O
the O
scissored O
blankets N
to O
the O
bathroom N
. O

The O
white O
and O
chrome N
was O
a O
shrine N
to O
Chanel O
. O

A O
place N
for O
everything O
, O
everything O
in O
its O
place N
. O
Peace N
. O

One O
day N
when O
my H
mother H
was O
taking O
me H
to O
school N
, O
the O
streets N
seemed O
very O
quiet N
. O

We H
parked O
, O
although O
we H
were O
the O
only O
car N
on O
the O
stretch O
of O
road N
, O
and O
we H
got O
out O
to O
walk O
slowly O
, O
hand N
in O
hand N
, O
through O
some O
flimsy O
barriers N
of O
paper N
and O
string N
. O

Far O
away O
we H
saw O
some O
policemen H
waving O
at O
us H
and O
we H
waved O
back O
. O

We H
heard O
a O
lorry N
coming O
up O
behind O
and O
my H
mother H
told O
me H
it O
had O
a O
television N
crew N
on O
board N
which O
excited O
me H
who O
had O
never O
seen O
a O
television N
. O

Anything O
that O
had O
been O
on O
the O
market N
for O
as O
little O
as O
ten O
years N
was O
unlikely O
to O
impress O
my H
father H
. O

' O
Are O
you H
happy O
, O
Alice H
? O
' O

' O
Yes O
, O
Daddy O
. O
' O

It O
should O
have O
been O
fun O
but O
neither O
of O
them O
was O
happy O
. O

When O
I H
was O
five O
my H
father H
was O
on O
pills N
and O
my H
mother H
was O
on O
gin N
. O

I H
think O
I H
was O
happy O
, O
in O
the O
maddening O
determined O
way N
that O
children H
have O
of O
being O
happy O
, O
and O
it O
was O
that O
happiness N
that O
worked O
as O
a O
magnet N
on O
both O
of O
my H
parents H
. O

They O
were O
pulled O
by O
it O
, O
they O
wanted O
it O
, O
and O
instead O
of O
taking O
it O
for O
granted O
, O
they O
started O
to O
take O
it O
to O
bits N
. O

At O
last O
we H
arrived O
at O
a O
small O
diner H
in O
a O
beaten-up O
part N
of O
town N
. O

She O
swung O
inside O
and O
we H
sat O
at O
a O
menacingly O
nice O
checked-cloth O
table N
with O
red O
carnations A
and O
a O
few O
rods A
of O
grissini O
. O

A O
boy H
came O
out O
with O
a O
carafe N
of O
red O
wine N
and O
a O
bowl N
of O
olives N
. O

He O
handed O
us H
the O
menus N
as O
if O
this O
was O
just O
an O
ordinary O
dinner N
in O
an O
ordinary O
day N
. O

I H
had O
fallen O
into O
the O
hands N
of O
the O
Borgias O
and O
now O
they O
wanted O
me H
to O
eat O
. O

When O
he O
stopped O
holding O
me H
up O
to O
the O
light N
he O
began O
to O
hold O
me H
up O
to O
the O
mirror N
. O

He O
wanted O
to O
compare O
us H
, O
side N
by O
side N
, O
did O
I H
look O
like O
him O
? O

He O
had O
enough O
money N
. O

It O
was O
his O
wife H
they O
were O
draining O
away O
. O

His O
friends H
interpreted O
the O
resentment N
as O
a O
normal O
response N
to O
a O
difficult O
situation N
. O

My H
mother H
took O
the O
simple O
view N
that O
a O
man H
must O
have O
his O
work N
. O

My H
father H
though O
, O
was O
not O
simple O
and O
he O
was O
still O
aware O
enough O
to O
turn O
the O
mask N
over O
and O
over O
in O
his O
hands N
and O
ask O
what O
it O
was O
. O

Uncharacteristically O
, O
he O
went O
to O
visit O
my H
grandmother H
. O

Months N
later O
, O
proud O
complacent O
Zeus H
had O
a O
headache N
and O
yowled O
his O
way N
over O
the O
earth N
, O
threatening O
to O
split O
the O
firmament N
with O
pain N
. O

It O
was O
Hermes O
who O
told O
him O
the O
source N
of O
his O
trouble N
, O
and O
Hephaestus O
, O
the O
lame O
god A
of O
the O
smithy N
who O
took O
a O
hammer N
and O
wedge N
and O
split O
open O
Lord A
Zeus's O
Zeus H
's H
skull N
. O

Out O
came O
Athene O
tall O
strong O
beautiful O
and O
her O
father's O
father H
's H
own O
. O

' O
You H
must O
be O
bored O
there O
, O
' O
said O
my H
mother H
. O

But O
that O
was O
in O
the O
future N
, O
and O
in O
1959 O
my H
father H
was O
in O
the O
fullness N
of O
his O
present N
, O
he O
could O
do O
no O
wrong O
. O

As O
the O
lorry N
came O
close O
to O
us H
, O
four O
young O
men H
dressed O
entirely O
in O
black O
ran O
past N
. O

Three O
of O
them O
carried O
guitars N
, O
one N
had O
a O
set O
of O
drumsticks N
. O

I H
had O
seen O
people N
dressed O
in O
black O
before O
. O

' O
Won't O
Wo O
n't O
hurt O
, O
' O
said O
Grandmother H
. O

' O
Look O
at O
me H
. O
' O

Husband H
and O
wife H
. O
Man H
and O
rib N
. O
What O
could O
be O
more O
normal O
than O
that O
? O

And O
now O
they O
were O
having O
a O
baby H
. O

That O
is O
, O
my H
mother H
was O
bearing O
my H
father's O
father H
's H
child H
. O

It O
was O
different O
when O
my H
sisters H
were O
born O
but O
I H
was O
Athene O
. O

Athene O
born O
fully O
formed O
from O
the O
head N
of O
Zeus H
. O

My H
father H
no O
longer O
wanted O
herring N
heads N
. O

He O
wanted O
mink N
and O
pearls N
and O
he O
got O
them O
. O

Like O
most O
men H
he O
was O
a O
transvestite H
at O
one N
remove O
; O
if O
his O
wife H
was O
part N
of O
him O
so O
were O
her O
clothes N
. O

She O
was O
his O
rib N
and O
as O
such O
he O
too O
wore O
a O
silk N
shift N
. O

He O
loved O
her O
clothes N
, O
loved O
to O
see O
her O
dressed O
up O
, O
it O
satisfied O
a O
part N
of O
him O
that O
was O
deeper O
than O
vanity N
. O

It O
was O
a O
part N
of O
himself O
. O

She O
completed O
him O
. O

She O
manifested O
him O
at O
another O
level N
. O

He O
absorbed O
her O
while O
she O
failed O
to O
absorb O
him O
. O

This O
was O
so O
normal O
that O
nobody H
noticed O
it O
. O

At O
least O
not O
until O
later O
, O
much O
later O
, O
when O
things N
began O
to O
change O
. O

Page N
of O
cups N

Her O
kitchen N
had O
strings N
of O
onions N
and O
fat O
hams N
hanging O
in O
glorious O
torture N
from O
twisted O
hooks N
in O
the O
ceiling N
. O

She O
smoked O
her O
own O
kippers N
up O
the O
chimney N
, O
skewering O
them O
in O
pairs N
with O
discarded O
knitting O
needles N
. O

For O
this O
she O
kept O
a O
wood N
fire N
. O

The O
other O
fireplaces N
were O
fed O
on O
coal N
. O

She O
had O
a O
glass-fronted O
cabinet N
lined O
with O
jars N
of O
homemade O
preserve O
; O
pickles N
, O
tomatoes N
, O
pears N
, O
cabbage N
, O
and O
in O
the O
middle O
, O
a O
baby H
rabbit A
. O

This O
was O
not O
for O
eating O
. O

It O
was O
an O
ornament N
. O

When O
the O
wind N
blew O
and O
the O
cupboard N
rattled O
the O
rabbit A
bobbed O
up O
and O
down O
in O
his O
transparent O
prison N
, O
his O
ears N
buckling O
slightly O
as O
they O
hit O
the O
lid N
seal O
. O

Like O
my H
grandmother H
he O
kept O
secrets N
the O
way N
other O
people N
keep O
fish A
. O

They O
were O
a O
hobby N
, O
a O
fascination N
, O
his O
underwater O
collection N
of O
the O
rare O
and O
the O
strange O
. O

Occasionally O
something O
would O
float O
up O
to O
the O
surface N
, O
unexpected O
, O
unexplained O
. O

' O
Tha O
wife's O
wife H
's H
to O
give O
birth N
. O
' O

She O
was O
not O
resourceful O
; O
her O
class N
did O
not O
allow O
it O
, O
and O
I H
know O
it O
worried O
my H
grandmother H
that O
her O
son H
had O
found O
a O
wife H
who O
did O
not O
know O
how O
to O
make O
a O
soup N
out O
of O
herring's O
herring N
's H
heads N
. O

' O
I H
christen O
this O
child H
... O
' O

He O
didn't O
did O
n't O
come O
home N
that O
night N
, O
nor O
the O
night N
after O
. O

The O
telephone N
rang O
each O
evening N
at O
six O
o'clock O
until O
a O
week N
had O
passed O
. O

My H
mother H
looked O
vaguer O
than O
usual O
and O
kept O
her O
light N
on O
all O
night N
. O

We H
were O
supposed O
not O
to O
notice O
. O

Now O
that O
it O
was O
winter N
the O
house N
was O
dark O
almost O
all O
day N
and O
the O
frost N
whitened O
the O
lawn N
. O

My H
sisters H
and O
I H
played O
quietly O
in O
the O
petrified O
air N
, O
our H
breath N
briefly O
warming O
the O
frozen O
spaces N
around O
us H
. O

We H
were O
waiting O
, O
waiting O
, O
watching O
the O
clock N
. O

Before O
we H
left O
we H
went O
to O
see O
my H
headmaster H
. O

I H
had O
just O
started O
secondary O
school N
and O
was O
restless O
and O
inattentive O
. O

The O
headmaster H
, O
noting O
that O
I H
had O
every O
advantage N
life N
could O
offer O
, O
assumed O
that O
I H
was O
either O
a O
bad O
child H
or O
a O
dull O
one N
. O

He O
was O
too O
afraid O
of O
my H
rugger-square O
father H
to O
use O
either O
of O
those O
words N
, O
at O
least O
I H
know O
that O
now O
, O
but O
at O
the O
time N
I H
believed O
he O
meant O
what O
he O
said O
. O

For O
the O
next O
eight O
years N
I H
lived O
shut O
away O
in O
the O
misery N
of O
his O
drawer N
. O

At O
that O
second N
the O
car N
was O
rocked O
on O
every O
side N
by O
thousands N
of O
screaming O
girls H
. O

I H
saw O
their O
faces N
streaked O
with O
tears N
pressed O
in O
agony N
against O
the O
windows N
and O
windscreen N
of O
the O
car N
. O

It O
can O
hardly O
have O
lasted O
a O
moment N
; O
they O
realised O
their O
prey A
was O
elsewhere O
and O
vanished O
as O
devilishly O
as O
they O
had O
appeared O
. O

When O
my H
mother H
got O
out O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
policeman H
, O
the O
only O
trace N
of O
what O
had O
happened O
was O
a O
broken O
banner N
painted O
HELP O
! O

The O
furniture N
was O
plain O
: O
a O
scrubbed O
sycamore N
table N
, O
a O
deep O
enamel N
sink N
, O
a O
few O
unmatched O
chairs N
and O
an O
evil-smelling O
Rayburn O
that O
left O
soot N
on O
my H
grandmother's O
grandmother H
's H
scones N
. O

As O
I H
was O
ready O
to O
go O
with O
my H
nightcase O
packed O
, O
my H
mother H
gave O
me H
a O
bottle N
of O
disinfectant N
. O

' O
For O
the O
out-house O
, O
' O
she O
said O
. O

' O
Don't O
Do O
n't O
tell O
Grandmother H
. O
' O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
tell O
Grandmother H
. O

My H
grandmother H
had O
been O
an O
honorary O
member N
of O
the O
secret O
police N
since O
she O
was O
born O
. O

It O
was O
impossible O
to O
hide N
anything O
from O
her O
. O

As O
I H
came O
through O
the O
back O
door N
into O
her O
kitchen N
she O
frisked O
me H
from O
head N
to O
foot N
, O
removed O
the O
disinfectant N
and O
gave O
me H
a O
pair N
of O
overalls N
to O
wear O
. O

' O
Help N
me H
clean O
out O
the O
toilet N
, O
' O
she O
said O
. O

I H
was O
strictly O
forbidden O
to O
listen O
to O
the O
Beatles O
and O
Beatles O
music N
was O
strictly O
forbidden O
at O
the O
now O
monthly O
parties N
my H
parents H
held O
for O
anyone O
who O
would O
come O
. O

I H
began O
to O
dread O
the O
parties N
; O
the O
unknown O
women H
who O
would O
come O
upstairs O
to O
cry N
in O
a O
spare O
bedroom N
. O

The O
drunk O
and O
drunker O
men H
who O
used O
to O
talk O
about O
the O
war N
and O
hold O
each O
other's O
other O
's H
knees N
. O

I H
persuaded O
my H
parents H
to O
let O
me H
go O
and O
stay O
with O
my H
grandmother H
on O
party N
nights N
. O

My H
mother H
was O
reluctant O
because O
she O
thought O
my H
grandmother H
was O
unhygienic O
. O

There O
was O
no O
foundation N
to O
this O
, O
only O
my H
grandmother's O
grandmother H
's H
absolute O
refusal N
to O
fit O
an O
inside O
toilet N
or O
to O
attend O
any O
of O
my H
mother's O
mother H
's H
Tupperware O
evenings N
. O

' O
Where O
has O
she O
gone O
? O
' O

' O
Why O
? O
' O

And O
he O
would O
stare O
at O
me H
in O
that O
way N
of O
his O
, O
trying O
to O
see O
happiness N
the O
way N
he O
could O
see O
a O
business N
opportunity N
. O

' O
Mob N
rule N
, O
' O
said O
my H
father H
who O
was O
thinking O
of O
moving O
to O
Southampton O
. O

Poor O
baby H
, O
passed O
from O
hand N
to O
hand N
like O
a O
pouch N
of O
tobacco N
, O
a O
fresh-faced O
narcotic O
promising O
hope O
, O
change O
, O
at O
least O
for O
now O
. O

My H
family H
are O
addicted O
to O
sentimentality N
. O

If O
that O
sounds N
cruel O
it O
is O
only O
the O
cruelty N
of O
too O
close O
observation N
for O
too O
long O
. O

Unable O
to O
express O
their O
feelings N
in O
the O
normal O
course N
of O
days N
and O
hours N
they O
need O
every O
legitimate O
excuse O
to O
do O
so O
. O

They O
cannot O
can O
not O
say O
' O
I H
love O
you H
' O
so O
they O
say O
' O
Isn't O
Is O
n't O
she O
lovely O
? O
' O
' O
Well O
done O
. O
' O

They O
can O
seem O
like O
bon O
viveurs O
, O
always O
a O
party N
in O
the O
offing N
, O
my H
mother H
planning O
a O
new O
recipe N
for O
canapés O
even O
in O
the O
act N
of O
stuffing O
my H
relatives A
with O
the O
ones N
she O
has O
just O
made O
. O

When O
they O
reached O
the O
docks N
my H
father H
backed O
into O
a O
loading O
bay N
and O
my H
grandmother H
stepped O
out O
of O
the O
shadows N
. O

Whilst O
I H
was O
adjusting O
to O
this O
unlikely O
apparition A
, O
my H
grandmother H
was O
doing O
the O
Twist O
or O
perhaps O
it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
say O
the O
Wiggle O
, O
since O
the O
two O
mobile O
parts N
were O
her O
bottom N
and O
her O
head N
. O

Her O
arms N
, O
bent O
at O
the O
elbow N
, O
were O
rigid O
in O
front N
of O
her O
, O
her O
feet N
were O
planted O
apart O
. O

' O
Come O
out O
, O
' O
said O
Grandmother H
. O

On O
the O
kitchen N
table N
was O
a O
brand-new O
bright O
blue O
Danette O
turntable N
. O

On O
the O
turntable N
was O
a O
45r.p.m. O
of O
the O
Beatles O
singing O
' O
Help N
! O
' O

When O
we H
had O
finished O
scooping O
out O
the O
dunny O
, O
and O
put O
fresh O
sawdust N
in O
the O
bottom N
to O
activate O
the O
new O
midden N
, O
my H
grandmother H
said O
she O
had O
a O
surprise O
for O
me H
. O

She O
made O
me H
stand O
in O
the O
corner N
of O
the O
kitchen N
behind O
the O
memorial N
oilskin N
, O
while O
she O
wheezed O
and O
whirred O
something O
out O
of O
the O
coal-hole O
. O

I H
could O
hear O
a O
crackling N
and O
a O
scratching O
and O
what O
sounded O
like O
fluff O
on O
the O
end N
of O
a O
record-player O
needle N
. O

I H
looked O
at O
the O
menu N
. O

FOOD N

. O

The O
difficulty N
. O
Something O
in O
her O
, O
something O
in O
him O
, O
something O
that O
I H
inherited O
that O
my H
sisters H
did O
not O
. O

The O
horse A
that O
crieth O
among O
the O
trumpets N
Aha O
! O

Why O
wrestle O
all O
night N
with O
an O
angel A
when O
the O
fight N
can O
only O
leave O
you H
lame O
? O

Why O
not O
walk O
away O
? O

Why O
not O
sleep O
? O

He O
had O
been O
taught O
to O
hold O
my H
head N
and O
to O
support N
my H
unfixed O
spine N
, O
and O
I H
seem O
to O
remember O
sitting O
solemnly O
on O
his O
level N
palm A
, O
trying O
to O
steady O
the O
out O
of O
focus O
vision N
of O
him O
, O
anxious O
, O
intent N
, O
gazing O
at O
me H
as O
if O
I H
could O
reveal O
to O
him O
what O
he O
was O
. O

' O
No O
, O
' O
said O
Grandmother H
. O

I H
grew O
. O

At O
nine O
, O
tall O
and O
silent O
, O
I H
was O
unhappy O
. O

My H
father H
, O
who O
had O
given O
up O
his O
religion N
but O
not O
the O
superstition N
that O
accompanied O
it O
, O
interpreted O
my H
misery N
as O
proof N
positive N
of O
Original O
Sin O
. O

Since O
there O
could O
be O
no O
reason N
for O
me H
to O
be O
unhappy O
, O
unhappiness N
must O
be O
the O
human O
condition N
. O

How O
could O
he O
hope O
to O
escape O
what O
an O
innocent O
child H
could O
not O
escape O
? O

Like O
my H
grandmother H
, O
he O
had O
a O
Gothic O
disposition N
, O
but O
she O
had O
kept O
her O
God H
and O
therefore O
her O
mercy N
. O

My H
father H
could O
find O
no O
mercy N
for O
himself O
and O
offered O
none N
. O

' O
Did O
he O
tell O
you H
that O
? O
' O

' O
This O
is O
where O
I H
met O
him O
, O
' O
she O
said O
. O

' O
In O
1947 O
on O
the O
day N
that O
I H
was O
born O
... O
' O

In O
my H
nightmares N
Time N
scooped O
up O
the O
sea N
in O
his O
hood N
and O
carried O
it O
away O
. O

He O
stood O
at O
the O
end N
of O
the O
world N
and O
poured O
the O
sea N
into O
space N
. O

' O
There's O
There O
's H
no O
sea N
there O
is O
there O
? O
' O

No O
one N
will O
doubt O
that O
my H
father H
had O
wanted O
a O
boy H
. O

He O
had O
assumed O
he O
would O
have O
a O
boy H
. O

Right O
up O
to O
a O
week N
after O
my H
birth N
he O
continued O
to O
say O
, O
' O
How O
is O
he O
? O
' O

My H
grandmother H
told O
me H
that O
he O
had O
turned O
me H
upside N
down O
in O
his O
huge O
hands N
and O
held O
me H
V-legged O
to O
the O
light N
, O
just O
to O
be O
sure O
that O
my H
genitals N
weren't O
were O
n't O
caught O
inside O
. O

He O
didn't O
did O
n't O
trust N
doctors H
. O

The O
white O
coat N
and O
stethoscope N
seemed O
to O
him O
to O
be O
a O
hide-out O
from O
the O
world N
. O

He O
resented O
the O
superiority N
, O
the O
authority N
, O
but O
of O
course N
he O
had O
never O
been O
ill O
. O

She O
would O
be O
greying O
, O
she O
would O
be O
lined O
, O
she O
would O
be O
overweight O
, O
she O
would O
be O
clothes-careless O
. O

She O
would O
be O
poetically O
besocked O

her O
into O

My H
grandmother H
got O
down O
a O
pair N
of O
kippers N
and O
broiled O
them O
for O
us H
in O
butter N
and O
water N

She O
asked O
me H
about O
my H
father H
, O
watching O
my H
body N
not O
listening O
to O
what O
I H
said O
, O
what O
could O

I H
loved O
him O

he O

' O
My H

They O
did O
not O

it O
again O

My H
father H
took O
his O
hat N
and O
scarf N
and O
walked O
down O
to O
the O
docks N
. O

There O
were O
men H
there O
he O
knew O
, O
idle O
like O
him O
, O
and O
they O
envied O
him O
his O
money N
and O
although O
he O
was O
not O
stupid O
enough O
to O
envy O
them O
their O
poverty N
, O
there O
was O
part N
of O
him O
that O
regretted O
all O
he O
had O
done O
. O

They O
drank O
together O
. O
He O
drank O
alone O
. O

He O
wanted O
to O
go O
with O
them O
to O
the O
filthy O
Admiral O
Arms O
but O
what O
right O
had O
he O
to O
sit O
in O
his O
cups N
when O
they O
would O
be O
going O
home N
to O
cheap O
rations N

unpaid O
bills N

He O
desperately O
wanted O
to O
say O
, O
' O
I H
am O
unhappy O
. O
' O

How O
could O
he O
say O
that O
to O
them O
? O

' O
Is O
it O
a O
funeral N
? O
' O
I H
asked O
my H
mother H
. O

On O
the O
sixth O
day N
of O
his O
absence N
my H
mother H
appeared O
in O
the O
dining N
room N
, O
in O
her O
mink N
coat N
, O
carrying O
a O
small O
suitcase N
. O

The O
three O
of O
us H
were O
doing O
a O
jigsaw N
while O
the O
inadequate O
fire N
tried O
to O
melt O
the O
icicles N
that O
were O
hanging O
in O
long O
spears N
around O
the O
room N
. O

' O
I H
have O
to O
go O
to O
your H
father H
, O
' O
she O
said O
and O
kissed O
us H
with O
her O
cold O
red O
mouth N
. O

' O
Grandmother H
will O
be O
here O
. O
' O

Her O
stocking O
seams N
were O
straight O
, O
her O
hair N
was O
curled O
, O
her O
back O
was O
upright O
, O
her O
waist N
was O
curved O
, O
her O
legs N
were O
long O
, O
her O
breasts N
round O
, O
her O
stomach N
was O
flat O
, O
her O
bottom N
was O
not O
. O

Black O
hair N
, O
blue O
eyes N
, O
red O
mouth N
, O
pale O
skin N
, O
and O
all O
this O
packed O
as O
neatly O
as O
picnic N
Tupperware O
. O

There O
was O
nothing N
of O
the O
whore H
about O
her O
and O
this O
my H
father H
liked O
. O

For O
the O
first O
time N
in O
months N
I H
felt N
my H
body N
slacken O
. O

I H
had O
been O
carrying O
myself H
like O
a O
gun N
, O
cocked O
, O
alert N
, O
ready O
for O
trouble N
, O
fearing O
it O
. O

My H
parents H
were O
rowing O
and O
when O
they O
weren't O
were O
n't O
rowing O
they O
were O
snapping O
and O
when O
they O
weren't O
were O
n't O
snapping O
they O
were O
planning O
a O
party N
, O
holding O
a O
party N
, O
cleaning N
up O
after O
a O
party N
. O

Here O
, O
shovelling O
human O
compost N
out O
of O
my H
grandmother's O
grandmother H
's H
cloaca N
, O
I H
was O
happy O
again O
. O

We H
stacked O
the O
rich O
mould N
around O
her O
roses A
and O
she O
sang O
me H
ballads N
from O
the O
docks N
, O
easing O
her O
voice H
with O
regular O
swigs N
from O
an O
unmarked O
tin-billy O
. O

' O
Grog-blossom O
, O
' O
she O
said O
tapping O
her O
nose N
the O
colour N
of O
the O
roses A
. O

The O
wind N
was O
warm O
, O
trade N
wind N
with O
generosity N
and O
travel O
in O
it O
, O
a O
wind N
to O
scatter O
the O
ships N
to O
the O
four O
corners N
of O
the O
earth N
and O
although O
my H
father H
was O
too O
young O
for O
ships N
with O
sails N
, O
like O
other O
water-men O
, O
the O
wind N
still O
excited O
him O
. O

A O
fair O
find O
. O

A O
new O
world N
. O

The O
recklessness N
of O
the O
sailor H
that O
my H
father H
loved O
. O

It O
was O
inevitable O
that O
the O
air N
should O
fight N
its O
war N
with O
the O
sea N
. O

Cargo O
and O
passengers H
alike O
preferred O
to O
fly O
and O
as O
shipping N
costs O
increased O
air N
prices N
dropped O
. O

My H
father's O
father H
's H
company N
, O
man H
and O
boy H
, O
was O
suffering N
unsustainable O
losses N
. O

Trident O
Shipping O
, O
funded O
1809 O
, O
was O
slowly O
going O
bankrupt O
and O
taking O
my H
father H
with O
it O
. O

He O
worked O
for O
a O
shipping N
company N
and O
had O
done O
so O
since O
he O
was O
fifteen O
. O

He O
had O
started O
at O
the O
end N
of O
the O
war N
as O
an O
office N
boy H
and O
fourteen N
years N
later O
was O
to O
be O
made O
a O
director H
of O
the O
line N
. O

To O
celebrate O
he O
made O
love O
to O
my H
mother H
and O
I H
was O
conceived O
. O

I H
helped O
Grandmother H
unpack O
her O
things N
; O
a O
week's O
week N
's H
supply N
of O
kippers N
and O
her O
Bible O
. O

I H
opened O
it O
at O
the O
marker N
and O
found O
that O
we H
were O
back O
at O
the O
Book O
of O
Job N
. O

This O
meant O
my H
grandmother H
was O
in O
tribulation N
, O
though O
on O
this O
occasion N
her O
tribulation N
had O
a O
kind N
of O
glittering O
intensity N
about O
it O
that O
heated O
the O
indifferent O
house N
and O
made O
us H
excited O
again O
. O

Very O
often O
she O
said O
, O
' O
The O
horse A
that O
crieth O
among O
the O
trumpets N
Aha O
! O
' O
and O
I H
wondered O
what O
kind N
of O
a O
horse A
it O
was O
that O
would O
do O
that O
. O

Undeterred O
, O
we H
imitated O
him O
and O
soon O
the O
zero O
house N
was O
filled O
with O
smells O
and O
smoke O
and O
voices N
crying O
Aha O
! O

I H
said O
, O
' O
If O
we H
were O
good O
always O
would O
we H
be O
happy O
always O
? O
' O

It O
would O
have O
been O
better O
if O
I H
had O
been O
made O
of O
nylon N
; O
easier O
then O
to O
soak O
out O
the O
miseries N
that O
were O
soaking N
in O
. O

These O
were O
his O
happiest O
times N
, O
the O
times N
when O
his O
paperwork N
was O
done O
, O
when O
he O
could O
hear O
his O
secretary H
rattling N
at O
the O
upright O
Remington O
as O
though O
it O
were O
a O
church N
piano N
. O

He O
worked O
evenings N
and O
early O
mornings N
so O
that O
he O
could O
make O
a O
gap N
to O
slip N
through O
, O
a O
private O
space N
after O
coffee N
and O
before O
lunch N
, O
when O
the O
piers N
were O
busy O
with O
every O
kind N
of O
activity N
, O
legitimate O
and O
not O
. O

She O
did O
teach O
me H
and O
we H
did O
not O
tell O
my H
mother H
or O
my H
father H
about O
the O
privy N
or O
the O
scones N
or O
the O
dancing N
lessons N
or O
the O
unnamed O
grog N
or O
the O
teenage O
turntable N
in O
its O
vinyl N
zip N
case N
or O
the O
happiness N
that O
was O
unhygienic O
or O
the O
sense N
of O
peace N
that O
had O
the O
smell O
of O
buttered O
kippers N
. O

He O
had O
booked O
his O
old O
room N
and O
even O
packed O
a O
tie N
he O
used O
to O
wear O
in O
those O
days N
. O

Red O
silk N
with O
little O
white O
polka N
dots N
, O
he O
never O
would O
say O
who O
had O
given O
it O
to O
him O
. O

' O
Never O
tell O
all O
thy O
love O
. O
' O

My H
father H
swung O
us H
up O
in O
his O
arms N
and O
laughed O
and O
said O
we H
were O
going O
on O
an O
adventure N
. O

' O
I'm O
I H
'm O
quite O
sure O
that O
it O
will O
be O
at O
least O
a O
week N
before O
the O
birth N
, O
' O
said O
my H
mother H
who O
immediately O
went O
into O
labour O
. O

The O
glittering O
fish A
were O
stars N
. O

My H
father H
had O
heard O
that O
Cunard O
, O
the O
most O
illustrious O
and O
prestigious O
shipping N
line N
in O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
, O
was O
to O
be O
bought O
up O
by O
Trafalgar O
House O
Investments N
. O

Cunard O
had O
recently O
taken O
delivery N
of O
their O
new O
flagship N
, O
the O
QE2 O
, O
and O
were O
making O
money N
on O
her O
. O

My H
father H
had O
been O
to O
the O
launch N
party N
in O
Southampton O
and O
met O
a O
few O
men H
he O
liked O
and O
who O
had O
liked O
him O
. O

Two O
of O
them O
had O
been O
to O
one N
of O
his O
foie O
gras O
parties N
. O

One O
of O
them O
had O
suggested O
he O
might O
consider O
a O
key N
role N
in O
the O
reorganisation N
of O
the O
Cunard O
enterprise N
, O
with O
particular O
responsibility N
for O
the O
QE2's O
QE2 O
's H
Atlantic O
crossings N
. O

For O
my H
father H
it O
seemed O
like O
the O
dream O
again O
, O
youth H
again O
, O
just O
married O
again O
, O
a O
place N
where O
the O
sea N
was O
still O
alive O
and O
where O
he O
too O
would O
be O
alive O
. O

Cunard's O
Cunard O
's H
headquarters N
were O
in O
London O
and O
in O
a O
matter N
of O
weeks N
so O
were O
we H
. O

She O
didn't O
did O
n't O
answer N
. O

She O
was O
looking O
back O
down O
the O
road N
. O

Suddenly O
she O
picked O
me H
up O
and O
shot N
a O
full O
pelt N
back O
to O
our H
car N
. O

I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
know O
my H
mother H
could O
run O
. O

I H
had O
never O
seen O
her O
run O
. O

She O
threw O
me H
in O
the O
back O
seat N
and O
flung O
herself O
in O
after O
me H
in O
a O
whirl N
of O
Dior H
and O
hairpins N
. O

The O
idea N
, O
his O
idea N
, O
was O
a O
three-day O
cruise N
to O
chase N
the O
comet N
Kohoutek O
, O
named O
after O
the O
Czech O
astronomer H
who O
had O
discovered O
it O
. O

It O
was O
expected O
to O
be O
one N
of O
the O
brightest O
comets N
of O
the O
twentieth O
century N
, O
and O
in O
some O
ways N
the O
cruise N
was O
the O
beginning O
of O
millennium N
fever N
. O

Religion N
may O
lose O
its O
appeal O
but O
portents N
are O
popular O
. O

The O
sell-out O
cruise N
, O
itself O
something O
of O
a O
foie O
gras O
, O
was O
packed O
with O
atheists H
looking O
for O
mystery N
. O

Unfortunately O
the O
weather N
was O
so O
bad O
that O
most O
of O
the O
adults H
found O
their O
best O
visions N
in O
a O
champagne N
bottle N
. O

My H
father H
was O
very O
busy O
and O
I H
was O
left O
alone O
. O

In O
1947 O
, O
certificated O
and O
handsome O
at O
eighteen O
, O
he O
was O
given O
a O
lowly O
job-with-prospects O
at O
Trident O
Shipping O
( O
Progress N
, O
Tradition N
, O
Integrity N
) O
. O

All O
of O
his O
family H
had O
worn O
clean O
clothes N
to O
work N
, O
that O
was O
their O
pride N
, O
but O
none N
had O
ever O
worn O
clean O
clothes N
home N
. O

For O
them O
it O
had O
been O
mother H
with O
a O
boiling O
hip-bath O
and O
a O
packet N
of O
soap N
flakes N
. O

My H
father H
went O
to O
work N
clean O
and O
he O
came O
home N
clean O
. O

This O
was O
an O
endless O
source N
of O
satisfaction N
to O
my H
grandmother H
who O
never O
lost O
her O
own O
whiff N
of O
elbow N
grease N
but O
delighted O
in O
the O
sweet O
smell O
of O
success N
. O

She O
had O
a O
long O
stride N
though O
I H
was O
taller O
. O

Soon O
we H
were O
at O
the O
Battery N
. O

Legend N
has O
it O
that O
the O
Ship N
, O
while O
seeking O
the O
Holy O
Grail O
, O
sailed O
off O
the O
end N
of O
the O
world N
and O
continued O
forever O
. O

At O
particular O
conjunctions N
of O
time N
and O
timelessness N
, O
it O
appears O
again O
as O
a O
bright O
light N
, O
shooting N
its O
course N
through O
the O
unfathomable O
universe N
, O
chasing O
that O
which O
has O
neither O
beginning O
nor O
end N
. O

Sighing O
, O
he O
threw O
down O
his O
cigarette N
and O
went O
inside O
, O
straightening O
his O
tie N
. O

He O
listened O
briefly O
. O

' O
Yes O
, O
yes O
. O
' O

Then O
he O
threw O
down O
the O
receiver H
and O
threw O
his O
secretary H
up O
into O
the O
air N
. O

For O
myself H
, O
in O
the O
dark O
, O
watching O
the O
thin O
silver N
line N
speed N
away O
, O
I H
had O
joined O
that O
band N
of O
pilgrims H
uncenturied O

a O
light N
that O
will O
not O

Godspeed O

My H
father H
at O
the O
wheel N
. O
My H
mother H
on O
a O
hard O
couch N
giving O
birth N
to O

. O

My H
mother H
lay O
with O
her O
skirts N
up O
over O
her O
face N
, O
her O
perfect O
stockings N
round O
her O
ankles N
, O
her O
pain N

against O
the O
heavy O
noise N
of O
the O
engine N

SHE O
: O
Women H
as O
well O
? O

ME H
: O
No O
. O

While O
she O
was O
talking O
I H
wondered O
why O

I H
had O
come O
out O
dressed O
to O
kill O

I H
was O
the O

not O
complete O
. O

I H
get O
one N
part N
of O
the O
picture N
and O
the O
rest N
lies N
in O
pieces N
. O

I H
suspect O
that O
there O
is O
no O
picture N
, O
only O
fragments N
. O

Other O
people N
seem O
to O
glue N
it O
together O
somehow O
and O
not O
to O
worry O
that O
they O
have O
been O
using O
pieces N
from O
several O
different O
boxes N
. O

So O
what O
is O
the O
answer N
? O

Is O
identity N
a O
deceit N
, O
a O
make-shift O
, O
and O
should O
we H
hurry N
to O
make O
any O
pattern N
we H
can O
? O

Or O
is O
there O
a O
coherence N
, O
perhaps O
a O
beauty N
, O
if O
it O
were O
possible O
to O
find O
it O
? O

I H
would O
like O
to O
convince O
myself H
about O
myself H
but O
I H
cannot O
can O
not O
. O

The O
best O
there O
is O
are O
days N
when O
the O
jigsaw N
assumes O
its O
own O
meaning N
and O
I H
no O
longer O
care N
what O
picture N
is O
emerging O
. O

By O
that O
I H
mean O
I H
am O
unfrightened O
by O
the O
unexpected O
. O

If O
there O
is O
beauty N
it O
will O
surprise O
me H
. O

Of O
all O
things N
it O
cannot O
can O
not O
be O
calculated O
. O

I H
said O
I H
suspect O
that O
there O
is O
no O
picture N
. O

I H
should O
have O
said O
that O
whatever O
the O
picture N
is O
, O
it O
will O
not O
be O
the O
one N
on O
the O
box N
. O

He O
lit O
every O
one N
of O
his O
distress N
flares N
and O
burnt O
up O
the O
river N
in O
a O
blaze N
of O
phosphorous O
red O
. O

Every O
tug N
and O
patrol N
boat N
on O
the O
stretch O
surrounded O
us H
, O
but O
far O
from O
sinking O
we H
were O
celebrating O
. O

My H
grandmother H
called O
it O
the O
Miracle O
of O
the O
Sardines N
and O
the O
Gin N
. O

She O
had O
only O
fetched O
enough O
for O
herself O
but O
there O
seemed O
to O
be O
plenty O
for O
everyone O
and O
so O
I H
was O
born O
, O
in O
dirt N
, O
in O
delight N
, O
in O
water N
and O
in O
spirits N
, O
with O
fish A
above O
and O
below O
and O
under O
an O
exacting O
star N
. O

I H
met O
Stella H
at O
the O
Algonquin O
Hotel O
. O

The O
Algonquin O
Hotel O
; O
Dorothy H
Parker H
, O
James H
Thurber O
, O
The O
New O
Yorker O
, O
my H
father H
in O
1957 O
. O

He O
had O
stayed O
there O
because O
it O
seemed O
so O
English O
and O
when O
he O
brought O
me H
to O
New O
York O
for O
the O
first O
time N
as O
a O
child H
our H
reservations N
were O
at O
the O
Algonquin O
Hotel O
. O

My H
grandmother H
loved O
me H
because O
she O
recognised O
the O
same O
stubbornness N
that O
she O
had O
gened O
in O
her O
son H
. O

The O
difficulty N
and O
the O
dream O
were O
not O
separate O
. O

To O
pan N
the O
living O
clay O
that O
you H
are O
is O
to O
stand O
in O
the O
freezing N
waters N
and O
break O
yourself H
on O
a O
riddle N
of O
your H
own O
making O
. O

No O
one N
can O
force N
you H
to O
it O
. O

No O
one N
can O
force N
you H
away O
. O

Rhinegold O
, O
pure O
gold N
and O
somewhere O
in O
the O
Rhinegold O
, O
the O
ring N
. O

Later O
, O
much O
later O
when O
I H
heard O
Wagner's O
Wagner H
's H
Ring O
cycle N
I H
thought O
of O
the O
times N
when O
I H
had O
been O
a O
very O
little O
child H
and O
my H
father H
had O
taken O
me H
to O
watch O
the O
sunset N
on O
the O
estuary N
. O

He O
loved O
the O
gold N
light N
dabbling O
the O
water N
. O

His O
mind N
played O
in O
it O
. O

He O
and O
his O
images N
were O
still O
free O
but O
then O
the O
moving O
gold N
hardened O
around O
him O
and O
he O
began O
to O
count O
it O
. O

The O
stories N
agree O
that O
in O
the O
difficulty N
and O
the O
dream O
the O
hero H
should O
never O
count O
the O
cost O
. O

On O
my H
sixth O
birthday N
the O
parties N
started O
. O

I H
had O
a O
cake N
, O
presents O
, O
a O
new O
frock N
. O

The O
adults H
had O
what O
my H
father H
called O
a O
' O
foie O
gras O
' O
. O

How O
much O
can O
you H
eat O
and O
drink N
without O
vomiting O
over O
the O
coffee N
table N
? O

Mother H
said O
: O
' O
Why O
didn't O
did O
n't O
you H
tell O
me H
? O
' O

His O
was O
the O
night N
vessel N
, O
the O
vessel N
on O
oily O
waters N
, O
his O
was O
the O
light N
shining O
in O
the O
darkness N
, O
come O
home N
, O
come O
home N
. O

On O
the O
night N
of O
my H
birth N
my H
father H
got O
the O
madness N
on O
him O
and O
told O
my H
mother H
he O
had O
to O
go O
tugging O
. O

' O
I'll O
I H
'll O
come O
with O
you H
, O
' O
she O
said O
. O

' O
I H
feel O
well O
. O
' O

At O
the O
same O
time N
I H
realised O
the O
absurdity N
of O
pinning O
anything O
onto O
a O
kiss O
. O

Deeper O
now O
where O
the O
water N
is O
not O
clear N
. O

What O
patterns N
do O
the O
numbers N
make O
? O

One O
plus O
one N
is O
not O
necessarily O
two O
. O

I H
do O
the O
sum N
and O
the O
answer N
is O
an O
incipient O
third O
. O

Three O
pairs N
of O
two O
: O
Jove O
and O
Stella H
, O
Jove O
and O
Alice H
, O
Alice H
and O
Stella H
and O
under O
the O
surface N
of O
each O
the O
head N
of O
the O
other O
. O

I H
sniffed O
the O
bottles N
. O

Here O
were O
the O
secrets N
of O
irresistible O
skin N
and O
salt N
smells O
of O
pearl N
and O
oyster A
. O

Not O
here O
the O
floral O
notes N
of O
the O
high-octave O
female O
. O

I H
admire O
the O
soprano H
singer H
but O
not O
the O
soprano H
speaker N
. O

High N
voices N
like O
high O
heels N
are O
a O
put-on N
. O

Unfortunately O
only O
the O
shoes N
get O
kicked O
off O
at O
night N
. O

I H
had O
dressed O
as O
a O
warrior H
: O
black O
from O
cleavage N
to O
insoles N
, O
hair N
down O
, O
fat O
hoops N
of O
gold N
in O
my H
ears N
, O
war-paint O
make-up N
. O

I H
had O
a O
twenty-year O
advantage N
over O
my H
opponent H
and O
I H
intended O
to O
use O
every O
month N
of O
it O
. O

' O
What O
have O
I H
made O
of O
my H
life N
? O
' O

' O
He O
was O
a O
flirt O
even O
then O
, O
' O
said O
Stella H
. O

' O
He O
flirted O
with O
Mama H
who O
had O
a O
weakness N
for O
dark O
hair N
and O
dark O
eyes N
, O
even O
in O
a O
sevenyear-old O
boy H
. O
' O

Of O
course N
she O
had O
not O
come O
. O

Of O
course N
she O
would O
not O
come O
. O

It O
had O
been O
a O
nerve N
war N
and O
I H
had O
won O
. O

I H
noticed O
I H
had O
a O
terrible O
pain N
in O
my H
neck N
. O

I H
ordered O
a O
drink N
and O
collapsed O
under O
a O
potted O
palm A
. O

' O
May O
I H
sit O
here O
? O
' O

' O
Please O
do O
. O

You H
must O
be O
English O
. O
' O

' O
Why O
? O
' O

There O
was O
a O
terrific O
rattling N
and O
thundering O
at O
the O
door N
and O
my H
mother H
and O
father H
burst O
into O
the O
hall N
; O
she O
in O
a O
silver N
fox A
, O
he O
in O
a O
new O
overcoat N
and O
trilby N
. O

Behind O
them O
, O
a O
taxi-driver O
struggled O
up O
the O
steps N
with O
a O
pile N
of O
boxes N
. O

The O
little O
boy H
had O
been O
asleep O
and O
through O
his O
dreams N
came O
a O
sleigh N
piled O
with O
furs N
and O
followed O
on O
foot N
by O
a O
band N
of O
wild O
dark O
men H
, O
huddled O
hurrying O
, O
talking O
in O
a O
language N
he O
did O
not O
understand O
. O

He O
heard O
barking N
and O
crying O
and O
from O
below O
the O
protesting O
water N
being O
drawn O
along O
the O
frozen O
pipes N
and O
into O
the O
geyser N
. O

He O
woke O
up O
and O
ran O
downstairs O
. O

The O
chairs N
and O
tables N
had O
been O
pushed O
back O
against O
the O
walls N
and O
the O
double O
doors N
onto O
the O
street N
were O
open O
. O

Through O
the O
blue O
curtain N
of O
cold O
, O
into O
the O
orange N
lights N
, O
six O
wolves A
drew O
a O
sledge N
. O

The O
leading N
pair N
pulled O
up O
two O
inches N
from O
his O
chest N
and O
level N
with O
it O
. O

One O
of O
the O
wolves A
licked O
his O
face N
with O
its O
brown-pink O
parma O
ham O
tongue N
. O

Now O
he O
would O
be O
eaten O
. O

They O
had O
begun O
with O
Genesis O
and O
were O
now O
at O
the O
Book O
of O
Job N
, O
with O
whose O
trials N
my H
grandmother H
sympathised O
, O
especially O
since O
she O
had O
recently O
developed O
a O
boil N
. O

' O
Aren't O
Are O
n't O
Americans O
polite O
? O
' O

' O
Only O
if O
you H
pay O
them O
enough O
. O
' O

' O
The O
British O
aren't O
are O
n't O
polite O
no O
matter N
how O
much O
you H
pay O
them O
. O
' O

' O
Then O
you H
and O
I H
must O
be O
refugees H
. O
' O

As O
she O
read O
' O
Who O
will O
avail N
me H
in O
my H
tribulation N
? O
' O
the O
door N
flew O
open O
and O
my H
father H
reached O
down O
into O
the O
bath N
and O
scooped O
out O
my H
mother H
whole O
and O
carried O
her O
off O
into O
the O
bedroom N
. O

Gut N
symmetries N

My H
father H
had O
told O
me H
about O
the O
remoras A
and O
how O
the O
Greek O
fishermen H
in O
the O
little O
boats N
still O
fear N
him O
. O

My H
father H
feared O
no O
remoras A
. O

We H
were O
quiet N
. O

She O
was O
looking O
towards O
the O
door N
. O

I H
looked O
at O
her O
. O

She O
was O
slim O
, O
wired O
, O
a O
greyhound A
body N
, O
half O
bent O
forward O
now O
, O
shape N
of O
her O
back O
muscles N
contouring O
her O
shirt N
, O
white O
, O
starched O
, O
expensive O
. O

Her O
left O
arm N
looked O
like O
the O
front N
window N
of O
Tiffany's O
Tiffany O
's H
. O

I H
was O
not O
sure O
how O
a O
woman H
could O
wear O
so O
much O
silver N
and O
sit O
without O
a O
lean O
. O

Her O
hair N
was O
dark O
red O
, O
dogwood A
red O
, O
leather N
red O
with O
a O
suppleness N
to O
it O
that O
is O
part N
gift N
, O
part N
effort N
. O

I H
guessed O
that O
the O
look O
of O
hers O
was O
as O
artful O
as O
it O
was O
artless O
. O

' O
David H
shan't O
sha O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
' O
she O
said O
. O

She O
gathered O
her O
things N
and O
together O
we H
left O
the O
destroyed O
room N
. O

I H
had O
to O
follow O
her O
as O
she O
twisted O
the O
pavements N
under O
her O
feet N
. O

I H
lost O
sense N
of O
where O
we H
were O
. O

The O
grid N
had O
buckled O
. O

The O
city N
was O
a O
bent O
alley N
and O
she O
was O
the O
better O
rat A
. O

' O
Then O
I H
shall O
be O
bad O

In O
1957 O
he O
married O
my H
mother H
. O

She O
was O
Irish O
, O
nearly O
well-to-do O
, O
the O
daughter H
of O
a O
partner H
in O
the O
firm O
who O
was O
based O
in O
Cork O
. O

My H
father H
had O
seen O
her O
at O
the O
Annual O
Dinner N
and O
Dance O
and O
vowed O
that O
he O
would O
marry O
her O
. O

For O
two O
years N
they O
exchanged O
letters N
and O
gifts N
until O
romance O
, O
persistence N
and O
a O
promotion N
won O
the O
day N
. O

On O
their O
wedding N
night N
, O
at O
the O
Hotel O
Ra-Ra O
( O
décor O
: O
Merseyside-Egypt O
) O
, O
my H
father H
took O
off O
his O
pyjamas N
so O
that O
his O
wife H
could O
see O
him O
man H
qua O
man H
, O
then O
told O
her O
that O
he O
would O
not O
make O
love O
to O
her O
until O
he O
had O
been O
made O
a O
director H
of O
the O
line N
. O

He O
put O
on O
his O
pyjamas N
again O
and O
after O
a O
moment N
or O
two O
of O
violent O
shuddering N
, O
fell O
asleep O
. O

She O
took O
me H
home N
, O
didn't O
did O
n't O
put O
on O
any O
lights N
, O
took O
off O
her O
clothes N
and O
had O
me H
lie O
down O
beside O
her O
on O
what O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
very O
narrow O
bed N
. O

I H
wanted O
to O
touch O
her O
. O

The O
reflecting O
image N
of O
a O
woman H
with O
a O
woman H
is O
seductive O
. O

I H
enjoyed O
looking O
at O
her O
in O
a O
way N
that O
was O
forbidden O
to O
me H
, O
this O
self O
on O
self O
, O
self O
as O
desirer O
and O
desired O
, O
had O
a O
frankness N
to O
it O
I H
had O
not O
been O
invited O
to O
discover O
. O

Desiring O
her O
I H
felt N
my H
own O
desirability N
. O

It O
was O
an O
act N
of O
power N
but O
not O
power N
over O
her O
. O

I H
was O
my H
own O
conquest N
. O

There O
was O
a O
wind N
in O
the O
room N
that O
tore O
the O
drink N
out O
of O
the O
drinkers H
, O
that O
scattered O
the O
bar N
bottles N
like O
bottle N
tops N
, O
that O
levitated O
the O
furniture N
and O
smashed O
it O
into O
the O
tranced O
wall N
. O

Waiters H
and O
waited O
on O
blew O
in O
rags N
out O
of O
the O
door N

There O
was O
nothing N
left O
in O
the O
room N
but O
she O
and O
me H
, O
she O
and O
me H
hypnotised O
by O
each O
other O
, O
unable O
to O
speak O
because O
of O
the O
wind N
. O

She O
looked O
at O
her O
watch O
. O

' O
Are O
you H
staying O
here O
? O
' O

' O
No O

I H
live O
in O
New O
York O

the O

The O
legend N
says O
that O
Zeus H
lusted O
after O
a O
Titan O
called O
Metis O
and O
eventually O
got O
her O
with O
a O
child H
. O

An O
oracle H
told O
Zeus H
that O
the O
baby H
would O
be O
a O
girl H
but O
that O
if O
Metis O
ever O
conceived O
again O
, O
she O
would O
wear O
a O
boy H
who O
would O
overthrough O
Zeus H
, O
just O
as O
Zeus H
had O
deposed O
his O
own O
father H
, O
Kronos O
. O

In O
fear N
, O
Zeus H
stroked O
and O
flattered O
Metis O
until O
she O
came O
close O
enough O
to O
kiss O
him O
of O
her O
own O
free O
will O
. O

He O
swallowed O
her O
. O

' O
I'll O
I H
'll O
teach O
you H
, O
' O
she O
said O
. O

When O
the O
hours N
were O
golden O
and O
green O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
the O
whole O
house N
levitated O
. O

My H
father H
pleased O
with O
his O
work N
, O
my H
mother H
pleased O
with O
her O
home N
and O
her O
children H
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
remember O
the O
exact O
moment N
of O
the O
eclipse O
, O
only O
a O
gradual O
chilliness N
and O
the O
golden O
light N
paling O
yellow-pale-yellow-yellow O
to O
fade O
. O

I H
do O
remember O
that O
my H
father H
felt N
cheated O
. O

His O
salary N
was O
insufficient O
, O
his O
bonus N
was O
insufficient O
, O
his O
challenges N
were O

his O
achievements N

not O
fully O

He O
said O
those O
things N
to O
my H
mother H
, O
I H
heard O
them O
, O
but O
to O
me H
he O
said O
, O
by O
the O
sun-dial O
, O
' O
I'm O
I H
'm O
forty-one O
and O
the O
sea N
is O
dying O
. O
' O

He O
ran O
his O
finger N
back O
and O
forth O
over O
the O
hooded O
Time N
. O

When O
he O
arrived O
home N
my H
mother H
was O
not O
expecting O
him O
. O

His O
secretary H
had O
not O
made O
the O
instructed O
call O
. O

Mother H
was O
in O
the O
bath N
, O
with O
bubbles N
up O
to O
her O
neck N
, O
and O
my H
grandmother H
, O
on O
the O
bath-stool O
, O
was O
reading O
out O
loud O
from O
the O
Bible O
. O

This O
was O
their O
regular O
Sunday O
visiting O
hour N
, O
and O
having O
little O
in O
common O
and O
less O
to O
say O
, O
they O
had O
hit O
on O
the O
happy O
idea N
of O
spiritual O
elevation N
. O

My H
mother H
never O
listened O
to O
what O
my H
grandmother H
read O
, O
but O
she O
felt N
she O
was O
doing O
her O
duty N
by O
her O
family H
and O
by O
God H
, O
and O
it O
saved O
her O
the O
trouble N
of O
going O
to O
church N
. O

My H
grandmother H
, O
who O
was O
firmly O
convinced O
by O
the O
Word O
of O
the O
Lord A
, O
took O
more O
pleasure N
in O
that O
hour N
than O
in O
any O
other O
of O
the O
week N
, O
including O
2 O
p.m. O
Thursday O
when O
she O
drew O
her O
pension N
. O

As O
she O
told O
the O
story N
she O
forgot O
about O
me H
. O

I H
had O
begun O
as O
an O
adversary H
, O
become O
an O
audience N
, O
and O
now O
seemed O
only O
a O
footlight O
. O

The O
stage N
was O
hers O
and O
if O
she O
was O
performing N
for O
anyone O
it O
was O
herself O
. O

A O
very O
good O
performer H
she O
was O
; O
breaking O
into O
Yiddish N
, O
into O
Italian O
, O
into O
German O
, O
accenting O
and O
gesturing O
, O
turning O
now O
into O
a O
claque N
of O
elderly O
Jews O
, O
now O
into O
a O
frightened O
small O
boy H
. O

I H
had O
to O
let O
go O
of O
my H
detachment N
, O
my H
resentment N
. O

When O
she O
imitated O
the O
horse A
that O
crieth O
among O
the O
trumpets N
' O
Aha O
! O
' O
, O
I H
was O
back O
with O
Grandmother H
again O
, O
back O
with O
the O
weekly O
visits N
and O
the O
preposterous O
slippers N
, O
the O
huge O
full-length O
apron N

its O
pocket N
stuffed O
with O
Polo O

and O
a O
battered O

' O
Yet O
, O
' O
said O
the O

No O
sign N

her O

The O
bar N
was O
a O
chessboard N
of O
couples N
manoeuvring O
Martinis O

waiters H
high-carrying O
chrome N
trays N

I H
moved O
in O
black O

the O

apart O
from O
a O
few O
appreciative O

there O
was O
no O
one N
who O
seemed O
interested O
in O
me H
. O

He O
would O
not O
sodomise O
his O
own O
wife H

Instead O
he O
went O
to O
New O

DPA O
: O
Iraqi O
authorities H
announced O
that O
they O
had O
busted O
up O
3 O
terrorist H
cells N
operating O
in O
Baghdad O
. O

Two O
of O
them O
were O
being O
run O
by O
2 O
officials O
of O
the O
Ministry O
of O
the O
Interior O
! O

The O
MoI O
in O
Iraq O
is O
equivalent N
to O
the O
US O
FBI O
, O
so O
this O
would O
be O
like O
having O
J. O
Edgar H
Hoover H
unwittingly O
employ O
at O
a O
high O
level N
members H
of O
the O
Weathermen O
bombers N
back O
in O
the O
1960s N
. O

The O
third O
was O
being O
run O
by O
the O
head N
of O
an O
investment N
firm O
. O

You H
wonder O
if O
he O
was O
manipulating O
the O
market N
with O
his O
bombing N
targets N
. O

The O
cells N
were O
operating O
in O
the O
Ghazaliyah O
and O
al O

Jihad O
districts N
of O
the O
capital N

Although O
the O
announcement N
was O
probably O
made O
to O
show O
progress N
in O
identifying O
and O
breaking O
up O
terror N
cells N
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
find O
the O
news N
that O
the O
Baathists O
continue O
to O
penetrate O
the O
Iraqi O
government N
very O
hopeful O
. O

It O
reminds O
me H
too O
much O
of O

were O
secretly O
working O
for O

Al H
- O
Zaman O
: O
The O
Iraqi O
High N
Electoral O
Commission N
on O
Friday O
denied O
a O
request N
of O
the O
Debaathification O
Commission N
to O
exclude O
51 O
individuals H
from O
running O
on O
party N
lists O
in O
the O
Dec. O
15 O
elections N
on O
grounds N
of O
having O
been O
sufficiently O
involved O
in O
Baath O
activities N
to O
warrant O
their O
being O
excluded O
from O
civil O
office N
. O

The O
Commission N
said O
it O
had O
no O
legal O
grounds N
for O
such O
an O
exclusion N
. O

This O
item N
is O
a O
small O
one N
and O
easily O
missed O
. O

But O
in O
my H
view N
it O
is O
highly O
significant O
. O

The O
Debaathification O
Commission N
had O
been O
pushed O
by O
Ahmad H
Chalabi O
and O
his O
Iraqi O
National O
Congress N
very O
hard O
, O
and O
had O
pushed O
many O
Sunni O
Arabs O
into O
the O
arms N
of O
the O
guerrillas H
. O

Chalabi O
has O
been O
increasingly O
marginalized O
within O
Iraq O
, O
however O
, O
despite O
his O
ties N
of O
clientelage O
with O
Washington O
and O
Tehran O
. O

He O
is O
no O
longer O
in O
the O
dominant O
Shiite O
list N
, O
the O
United O
Iraqi O
Alliance O
, O
and O
won't O
wo O
n't O
have O
many O
seats N
in O
the O
new O
parliament N
. O

Some O
2,000 O
junior O
officers H
of O
the O
old O
Baath O
army N
have O
been O
recalled O
to O
duty N
in O
recent O
months N
, O
something O
Chalabi O
would O
have O
blocked O
if O
he O
could O
have O
. O

Now O
the O
Electoral O
Commission N
is O
refusing O
to O
punish O
people N
for O
mere O
past N
Baath O
Party O
membership N
. O

The O
situation N
in O
Iraq O
is O
only O
going O
to O
get O
better O
this O
way N
. O

If O
someone H
committed O
a O
crime N
against O
humanity N
, O
prosecute O
the O
person H
. O

If O
he O
or O
she O
did O
not O
, O
then O
they O
should O
have O
all O
the O
same O
rights N
as O
other O
Iraqis O
. O

1982 O
massacre N

In O
Baghdad O
the O
fighting O
still O
continues O
in O
several O
areas N
, O
mostly O
in O
Sadr O
city N
and O
Adhamiya O
. O

Baghdadis O
don't O
do O
n't O
venture N
much O
out O
of O
their O
neighbourhoods N
any O
more O
, O
you H
never O
know O
where O
you H
might O
get O
stuck O
. O

There O
has O
been O
talk O
that O
the O
night N
curfew N
might O
be O
implemented O
again O
. O

My H
neighbourhood N
has O
been O
surrounded O
by O
American O
troops N
for O
three O
days N
now O
, O
helicopters N
have O
been O
circling O
over O
our H
heads N
non-stop O
. O

Fedayeen N
are O
now O
visible O
on O
the O
street N
and O
they O
have O
become O
bolder O
than O
ever O
. O

Yesterday N
there O
were O
tens N
of O
them O
putting O
road N
blocks N
on O
our H
street N
and O
setting N
up O
mortars N
, O
they O
only O
come O
out O
in O
the O
open O
when O
Americans O
leave O
the O
area N
, O
then O
they O
start O
firing O
mortars N
indiscriminately O
and O
shooting N
their O
AK O
- O
47's O
in O
the O
air N
. O

They O
are O
setting N
the O
road N
blocks N
at O
the O
exact O
same O
positions N
they O
were O
during O
the O
war N
last O
year N
, O
which O
indicates O
they O
are O
the O
same O
people N
. O

And O
there O
is O
nothing N
we H
can O
do O
about O
it O
really O
, O
people N
who O
are O
suggesting O
that O
we H
go O
out O
and O
fight N
them O
are O
living O
in O
dream O
land O
. O

Even O
the O
IP O
and O
ICDC O
have O
abandoned O
the O
neighbourhood N
, O
and O
those O
are O
trained O
and O
armed O
, O
so O
don't O
do O
n't O
expect O
scared O
civilians H
to O
do O
anything O
except O
to O
hide N
inside O
and O
pray O
a O
helicopter N
or O
a O
tank N
doesn't O
does O
n't O
bomb N
them O
, O
and O
also O
how O
are O
American O
soldiers H
going O
to O
distinguish O
the O
brave O
and O
valiant O
civilians H
from O
the O
Fedayeen N
? O

Everyone O
is O
apprehensive O
, O
there O
is O
some O
talk O
that O
April O
9th O
and O
10th O
are O
going O
to O
be O
bloody O
days N
. O

Most O
people N
haven't O
have O
n't O
gone O
to O
work N
the O
last O
few O
days N
, O
although O
it O
seems O
that O
the O
rest N
of O
Baghdad O
is O
' O
normal O
' O
( O
if O
you H
can O
define O
what O
normal O
is O
) O
. O

There O
are O
rumours N
about O
preparations N
by O
slum N
dwellers H
for O
another O
looting N
spree N
against O
banks N
, O
governmental O
and O
public O
property N
similar O
to O
the O
one N
that O
took O
place N
last O
April O
, O
and O
I H
have O
already O
overheard O
youngsters H
in O
my H
neighbourhood N
joking O
about O
it O
and O
saying O
things N
like O
" O
This O
time N
we H
will O
be O
the O
first O
to O
loot N
, O
we H
didn't O
did O
n't O
get O
anything O
the O
last O
time N
" O
. O

Mosques N
are O
calling O
for O
donating O
blood N
, O
food N
, O
and O
medicine N
for O
Fallujah O
, O
and O
several O
convoys N
have O
already O
headed O
out O
for O
Fallujah O
, O
most O
of O
them O
returned O
later O
though O
. O

What O
irritates O
me H
is O
this O
sudden O
false O
' O
solidarity N
' O
between O
Sunni O
and O
Shi'ite O
clerics H
, O
we H
all O
know O
that O
they O
would O
be O
glad O
to O
get O
at O
each O
others O
other O
s O
throats N
when O
they O
have O
the O
chance N
, O
and O
Shia O
clerics H
were O
describing O
Fallujan O
insurgents H
as O
' O
Ba'athists O
' O
, O
' O
Saddamites O
' O
, O
' O
Wahhabis O
' O
, O
and O
' O
terrorists H
' O
just O
a O
few O
days N
ago O
. O

So O
what O
happened O
? O

I H
guess O
it's O
it O
's H
just O
the O
old O
new O
Arab O
' O
Me H
against O
my H
brother H
, O
me H
and O
my H
brother H
against O
my H
cousin H
, O
me H
and O
my H
cousin H
against O
my H
enemy N
' O
, O
or O
' O
The O
enemy N
of O
my H
enemy N
is O
my H
friend H
' O
thing N
going O
on O
again O

Speaking O
of O

we H
have O
only O

our H

in O
a O

THE O
MYTHS O
OF O
CHERNOBYL O
which O
contained O
the O
following O
: O

One O
of O
the O
most O
widespread O
myths N
of O
recent O
times N
is O
that O
the O
Chernobyl O
nuclear O
reactor N
accident N
in O
1986 O
caused O
many O
thousands N
of O
extra O
cancer N
deaths N
in O
neighbouring O
regions N
, O
and O
that O
public O
health N
has O
been O
severely O
affected O
by O
exposure N
to O
radiation N
. O

Many O
people N
still O
believe O
that O
to O
be O
true O
, O
even O
though O

should O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O

proven O
otherwise O
. O

The O
prestigious O
IAEA O
( O
International O

published O
an O
early O
report N
on O
Chernobyl O
which O
was O
based O
on O
information N
from O
Russian O
sources N
and O
stated O
that O
there O
was O
no O
significant O

However O
, O
in O

, O
the O
IAEA O
published O
Fifteen O

As O
a O

I H
can O
well O

There O
is O
a O

Being O
well O

give O
you H

that O
is O
desirable O

radiation N
: O

As O
a O
child H
in O
the O
50's N
I H
had O
a O
lot N
of O
glandular O
problems N

they O
treated O
it O
with O
radiation N
therapy N
( O
primitive O
at O
best O
! O
) O
and O
stopped O
when O
a O
lesion N
on O
my H
neck N
started O
enlarging O
-- O
they O
said O
it O
was O
not O
CA O
but O
stopped O
the O
treatments N

Remember O
the O
old O
shoe N

that O
was O
a O
form N
of O
radiation N

? O

That O
too O
was O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
have O
to O

what O
radiation N

done O
and O
is O
still O
doing O
to O
Hirsohima O

there O
can O

The O
Chernobyl O
Children's O
Children H
's H
Project O
( O
http://www.adiccp.org/home/default.asp O
) O
offers O
several O
ways N
to O
help O
the O
children H
of O
that O
region N
. O

One O
of O
them O
is O
the O
Rest O
and O
Recuperation O
Program N
, O
wherein O
a O
child H
can O
come O
to O
the O
US O
for O
a O
few O
weeks N
in O
the O
summer N
. O

Even O
a O
little O
time N
spent O
receiving O
wholesome O
, O
uncontaminated O
food N
, O
good O
medical O
care N

etc. O
can O
add O

S. O
and O
I H
have O
an O
acquaintance H
who O
has O
hosted O
several O
of O
these O
children H
for O
many O
years N
; O
to O
see O
these O
little O
ones N
breaks O
the O
heart N
. O

The O
urge N
to O
protect O
and O
gather O
them O
all O
in O
is O
almost O
overwhelming O
, O
and O
makes O
me H
more O
grateful O
for O
the O
blessings N
I H
have O
. O

us H
about O
the O
hopes N

the O
remaining O

Because O
the O

Assassinate O

Gen. O
Pervez O
Musharraf O
, O
the O
Pakistani O
military O
" O
president H
" O
who O
had O
made O
a O
coup O
in O
1999 O
and O
has O
thrown O
in O
his O
lot N
with O
the O
United O
States O
against O
the O
Taliban O
and O
al O
- O
Qaeda O
. O

Musharraf O
has O
been O
trying O
to O
purge O
his O
officer H
corps N
of O
the O
substantial O
number N
of O
al O
- O
Qaeda O
sympathizers H
. O

His O
military O
intelligence N
has O
captured O
major O
figures N
like O
Abu H
Zubayda O
and O
Khalid O
Shaykh O
Muhammad H
, O
as O
well O
as O
nearly O
500 O
other O
al O
- O
Qaeda O
operatives H
, O
over O
400 O
of O
whom O
the O
Pakistanis O
have O
turned O
over O
to O
the O
US O
. O

Musharraf O
held O
elections N
in O
October O
of O
2002 O
, O
in O
which O
center N
- O
right O
parties N
did O
well O
, O
but O
in O
which O
nearly O
20 O
percent N
of O
parliament N
seats N
went O
to O
the O
fundamentalist O
religious O
party N
coalition N
, O
MMA O
. O

MMA O
also O
captured O
the O
Northwest O
Frontier O
Province O
, O
which O
probably O
shelters N
Bin H
Laden O
and O
al O
- O
Zawahiri O
, O
and O
is O
in O
a O
joint O
government N
of O
Baluchistan O
Province O
, O
also O
on O
the O
Afghanistan O
border N
. O

If O
al O
- O
Qaeda O
can O
kill O
Musharraf O
or O
instigate O
a O
military O
coup O
against O
him O
by O
Islamist O
junior O
officers H
, O
they O
can O
hope O
to O
catapult N
the O
MMA O
to O
power N
as O
political O
allies N
and O
hosts O
. O

They O
would O
thereby O
gain O
control N
of O
a O
major O
base N
for O
terrorist H
operations N
, O
which O
is O
also O
a O
nuclear O
power N
. O

All O
this O
is O
highly O
unlikely O
, O
as O
with O
most O
al O
- O
Qaeda O
crackpot H
schemes N
. O

But O
so O
was O
it O
unlikely O
that O
a O
small O
group N
of O
Arab O
mujahidin N
would O
virtually O
take O
over O
Afghanistan O
. O

Response N
: O
The O
US O
must O
do O
whatever O
it O
can O
to O
strengthen O
the O
legitimacy N
of O
the O
Pakistani O
government N
. O

On O
the O
one N
hand N
, O
it O
should O
pressure O
Musharraf O
to O
take O
off O
his O
uniform N
and O
run O
for O
president H
in O
a O
fair O
election N
, O
and O
to O
repeal O
the O
contentious O
" O
Legal O
Framework N
Order N
" O
that O
essentially O
perpetuates O
his O
dictatorship N
. O

On O
the O
other O
, O
restrictions N
should O
be O
lifted O
on O
the O
mainstream O
Muslim O

and O
Pakistan O
People's O
People N

Party O

who O
can O
defeat N
the O
MMA O
in O
fair O
elections N
if O
not O
hogtied O
by O
the O
secret O
police N
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand N
, O
the O
US O
should O
strong O
- O
arm N
India O
and O
Pakistan O
into O
a O
final O
settlement N
of O
the O
Kashmir O
issue N

Musharraf's O
Musharraf O
's H
lack N
of O
progress N
in O
helping O
the O
Muslims O
of O
that O
Indian O
state N
as O
a O
justification N
for O
his O
overthrow N
. O

The O
Kashmir O
issue N
generates O
far O
more O
terrorism N
, O
and O
even O
the O
threat N
of O
nuclear O
war N
, O
than O
Iraq O
ever O
did O

Response N

The O

succeeded O
in O
politically O

started O
the O
process N

now O
only O
pull O
off O

less O
sophisticated O

It O

continue O

simply O
not O
working O
as O

Sharon's O
Sharon H

worked O
in O

the O
sooner O
the O

can O
be O
withdrawn O
in O
favor N

less O

the O

Getting O
the O
Spanish O
out O
of O
Iraq O
isn't O
is O
n't O
nearly O
as O
good O
a O
rallying O
cry N
for O
al O
- O

in O
the O
Arab O
world N
as O
getting O
the O
Americans O
and O
British O
out O
. O

The O
thing N
to O
keep O
in O
mind N
is O
that O
Sunni O
Arab O
nationalists H
and O
Baathists O
and O
local O
Sunni O
radicals H
are O
likely O
to O
remain O
far O
more O
dangerous O
to O
the O
US O
in O
Iraq O
than O
al O

infiltrators H
, O
and O
it O
would O
be O
dangerous O

George H
W. O
Bush H
alleged O
Thursday O
that O
John H
Edwards H
lacks O
the O
experience N
necessary O
to O

. O

The O
problem N
with O
this O
argument N
is O
that O
Bush H
lacked O
the O
experience N
necessary O
to O
be O
president H
when O
he O
ran O
in O

Texas O
Gov. O
George H
W. O
Bush H
is O
enduring O
sharp O
criticism N

Hiller O
asked O
Bush H
to O
name N
the O
leaders H
of O
Chechnya O
, O

, O

Bush H
was O
only O
able O

a O
partial O
response N
to O
the O
query N
on O
the O
leader H

He O

" O
Can O
you H

" O

Hiller O
asked O

inquiring O
about O
Gen. O
Pervaiz O

who O
seized O

the O
country N
October O

" O
Wait O

wait N

is O
this O
50 O

" O
asked O
Bush H

Hiller O
replied O
: O
" O
No O
, O
it's O
it O

four O
questions N
of O
four O
leaders H

four O
hot O

. O

Bush H
, O
in O
answering O
the O
question N
about O
the O
leader H
of O
Pakistan O
, O
also O
said O
: O
" O
The O
new O
Pakistani O

, O
he's O
he O
's H
just O
been O
elected O
-- O
not O
elected O
, O
this O
guy H
took O
over O
office N
. O

It O
appears O
this O
guy H
is O
going O
to O
bring O
stability N
to O
the O
country N
and O
I H
think O
that's O
that O
's H
good O
news N
for O
the O
subcontinent N

" O

Gore H
released O
a O
statement N
Friday O
taking O
Bush H
to O
task N
for O
his O
comments N
on O
Pakistan's O
Pakistan O
's H
recent O
coup O
. O

" O
I H
find O
it O
troubling O
that O
a O
candidate H
for O
president H
in O
our H
country N
-- O
the O
world's O
world N
's H
oldest O
democracy N
-- O
would O
characterize O
the O
military O
takeover N
as O
" O
good O
news N
, O
" O
Gore H
said O
. O

" O
Further O
, O
I H
find O
it O
even O
more O
disturbing O
that O
he O
made O
these O
comments N
about O
a O
nation N
that O
just O
last O
year N
tested O
nuclear O
weapons N
-- O
shortly O
after O
voicing O
his O
public O
opposition N
to O
the O
Comprehensive O
Test O
Ban O
Treaty N
. O

A O
spokesman H
for O
President H
Clinton H
also O
criticized O
Bush's O
Bush H
's H
comments N
. O

" O
It O
is O
very O
dangerous O
for O
this O
country N
to O
condone O
the O
overthrow N
of O
democratically O
elected O
governments N
, O
" O
said O
David H
Leavy O
, O
spokesman H
for O
the O
National O
Security N
Council N
. O

Not O
only O
did O
Bush H
not O
know O
who O
General O
Pervez O
Musharraf O
was O
, O
he O
seems O
to O
have O
confused O
coup O
- O
making O
with O
" O
taking O
office N
, O
" O
and O
moreover O
went O
on O
to O
suggest O
that O
the O
overthrow N
of O
an O
elected O
prime O
minister H
and O
the O
installation N
in O
power N
of O
the O
Pakistan O
military O
, O
then O
the O
world's O
world N
's H
strongest O
supporter H
of O
the O
Taliban O
, O
would O
bring O
" O
stability N
! O
" O

Musharraf O
made O
his O
coup O
in O
part N
because O
of O
the O
military's O
military O
's H
anger N
over O
Prime O
Minister H
Nawaz O
Sharif's O
Sharif H
's H
willingness N
to O
back O
down O
from O
confronting O
India O
over O
Kashmir O
, O
so O
that O
he O
explicitly O
came O
to O
power N
as O
a O
warmonger H
. O

I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
tell O
you H
how O
ominous O
I H
found O
Bush's O
Bush H
's H
performance N
in O
that O
interview N
. O

I H
still O
remember O
him O
stuttering O
about O
" O
the O
General O
, O
" O
unable O
to O
remember O
Musharraf's O
Musharraf O
's H
name N
. O

He O
obviously O
had O
no O
idea N
what O
he O
was O
talking O
about O
, O
though O
he O
demonstrated O
a O
number N
of O
ill O
- O
fated O
instincts N
. O

He O
obviously O
liked O
authoritarian O
rule N
better O
than O
democracy N
, O
equating O
dictatorship N
with O
" O
stability N
. O
" O

And O
, O
he O
didn't O
did O
n't O
think O
he O
needed O
to O
know O
anything O
about O
South O
Asia O
, O
with O
its O
nuclear O
giants A
and O
radical O
religious O
politics N
-- O
the O
latter N
a O
dire O
security N
threat N
to O
the O
US O
. O

He O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
tell O
when O
things N
were O
becoming O
more O
unstable O
as O
opposed O
to O
less O
. O

Musharraf O
went O
on O
to O
play O
nuclear O
brinkmanship N
with O
India O
in O
2002 O
, O
risking O
war N
twice O
that O
year N
. O

Although O
Musharraf O
did O
turn O
against O
the O
Taliban O
after O
September O
11 O
, O
under O
extreme O
duress N
from O
the O
US O
, O
elements N
of O
his O
military O
continued O
to O
support N
radical O
Islamism O
and O
have O
recently O
been O
implicated O
in O
assassination N
attempts N
on O
Musharraf O
himself O
. O

This O
was O
the O
body N
that O
Bush H
proclaimed O
was O
bringing O
" O
stability N
" O
to O
the O
region N
in O
fall N
of O
1999 O
. O

So O
, O
one N
answer N
to O
Bush's O
Bush H
's H
charge O
about O
Edwards H
is O
that O
if O
it O
had O
any O
merit N
, O
Bush H
should O
have O
declined O
to O
run O
himself O
. O

Another O
answer N
is O
that O
Edwards H
certainly O
knows O
far O
more O
about O
foreign O
affairs N
now O
than O
Bush H
did O
then O
. O

Indeed O
, O
given O
how O
Bush H
has O
rampaged O
around O
the O
world N
alienating O
allies N
and O
ignoring O
vital O
conflicts N
with O
the O
potential N
to O
blow O
back O
on O
the O
US O
, O
one N
might O
well O
argue O
that O
Edwards H
knows O
more O
now O
than O
Bush H
does O
. O

This O
is O
what O
Edwards' O
Edwards H
' O
campaign N
literature N
said O
about O
his O
positions N
: O
" O
Edwards H
believes O
that O
the O
U.S. O
must O
be O
an O
active O
leader H
to O
help O
resolve O
conflicts N
, O
from O
reducing O
tensions N
between O
India O
and O
Pakistan O
to O
the O
peace N
process N
in O
Northern O
Ireland O
. O

Edwards H
is O
a O
strong O
supporter H
of O
Israel O
, O
and O
believes O
that O
the O
U.S. O
has O
a O
vital O
role N
in O
promoting O
peace N
between O
the O
Israelis O
and O
the O
Palestinians O
. O
" O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
see O
Bush H
doing O
any O
of O
this O
. O

2004 O

As O
the O
American O
public O
gradually O
wearies O
of O
the O
Iraq O
crisis N
, O
some O
have O
begun O
worrying O
that O
the O
war N
could O
blow O
back O
on O
the O
US O
by O
creating O
the O
conditions N
for O
anti-American O
terrorism N
. O

Israel O
, O
however O
, O
is O
much O
closer O
to O
Iraq O
and O
is O
likely O
to O
suffer O
from O
Iraqi O
instability N
much O
more O
acutely O
than O
will O
the O
United O
States O
. O

Ironically O
, O
among O
the O
strongest O
proponents H
of O
war N
in O
Iraq O
were O
Israeli O
Prime O
Minister H
Ariel H
Sharon H
and O
his O
neoconservative O
supporters H
in O
the O
US O
. O

Have O
they O
, O
however O
, O
actually O
weakened O
Israeli O
security N
? O

The O
biggest O
threat N
Israel O
faces N
is O
not O
from O
conventional O
armies N
but O
from O
the O
asymmetrical O
tactics N
of O
Palestinian O
national O
liberation N
movements N
. O

The O
derailing O
of O
the O
Oslo O
peace N
process N
by O
the O
hard O
- O
line N
policies N
of O
Sharon H
and O
the O
Palestinian O
intifada N
has O
encouraged O
suicide N
bombings N
. O

This O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
has O
discouraged O
international O
investment N
in O
Israel O
and O
has O
made O
it O
less O
likely O
that O
immigrants H
to O
the O
country N
will O
actually O
remain O
there O
. O

Although O
Israel O
withdrew O
from O
Lebanese O
territory N
in O
May O
2000 O
, O
the O
radical O
Lebanese O
Shiite O
party N
, O
Hizbullah O
, O
has O
not O
been O
mollified O
. O

It O
is O
estimated O
to O
have O
some O
5,000 O
armed O
fighters N
, O
and O
they O
have O
pursued O
attacks N
against O
Israeli O
forces N
to O
compel O
them O
to O
withdraw O
from O
the O
Shebaa O
Farms O
, O
a O
sliver N
of O
Syrian O
territory N
that O
Israel O
annexed O
after O
the O
1967 O
war N
. O

Any O
thorough O
assessment N
of O
the O
impact N
of O
the O
Iraq O
war N
and O
its O
aftermath N
on O
Israel's O
Israel O
's H
security N
environment N
must O
, O
therefore O
, O
closely O
examine O
its O
likely O
effect N
on O
the O
conduct O
of O
asymmetrical O
warfare N
. O

Although O
it O
is O
often O
alleged O
( O
without O
much O
evidence N
) O
that O
Saddam H
Hussein H
gave O
money N
to O
the O
families N
of O
Palestinian O
suicide N
bombers N
and O
so O
encouraged O
asymmetrical O
warfare N
, O
it O
is O
not O
clear N
that O
he O
actually O
posed O
a O
danger N
to O
Israel O
. O

The O
Palestinians O
who O
have O
been O
willing O
to O
kill O
themselves O
to O
end N
the O
Israeli O
occupation N
of O
the O
Gaza O
Strip O
and O
the O
West O
Bank N
were O
not O
driven O
by O
economic O
considerations N
. O

Saddam H
never O
did O
anything O
practical O
to O
help O
the O
Palestinians O
. O

At O
some O
points O
, O
as O
in O
the O
late O
1980s N
, O
he O
reportedly O
made O
behind O
- O
the O
- O
scenes N
overtures N
to O
the O
Israelis O
to O
arrive O
at O
some O
sort N
of O
a O
deal O
. O

He O
did O
not O
allow O
Palestinian O
radicals H
to O
launch N
operations N
against O
Israel O
from O
Iraq O
. O

By O
the O
late O
1990s N
, O
Iraq O
had O
no O
nuclear O
or O
biological O
weapons N
program N
, O
and O
had O
destroyed O
its O
chemical N
weapons N
stockpiles N
. O

Its O
ramshackle O
army N
had O
virtually O
collapsed O
before O
the O
American O
invasion N
in O
2003 O
. O

If O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
see O
how O
Baathist O
Iraq O
posed O
any O
real O
threat N
to O
Israel O
, O
it O
is O
not O
so O
difficult O
to O
see O
a O
menace N
in O
the O
current O
instability N
. O

The O
bungling O
of O
post-war O
Iraq O
by O
the O
Bush H
administration N
created O
a O
weak O
and O
failed O
state N
. O

Armed O
militias N
, O
many O
staffed O
by O
former O
Iraqi O
military O
men H
with O
substantial O
training N
and O
experience N
, O
have O
proliferated O
. O

The O
US O
chose O
to O
ally H
itself O
with O
such O
groups N
as O
the O
Supreme O
Council N
for O
the O
Islamic O
Revolution N
in O
Iraq O
, O
whose O
15,000 O
- O
strong O
Badr O
Corps O
paramilitary N
was O
trained O
by O
the O
Iranian O
Revolutionary O
Guards O
. O

Anti-Israeli O
and O
pro-Palestinian O
feeling O
is O
strong O
among O
several O
major O
Iraqi O
ideological O
groups N
and O
currents N
. O

The O
more O
radical O
Shiites O
, O
who O
generally O
follow O
the O
theocratic O
notions N
of O
Iran's O
Iran O
's H
Ayatollah O
Ruhollah O
Khomeini O
, O
routinely O
chant O
and O
demonstrate O
against O
Israel O
. O

They O
vehemently O
protested O
the O
Israeli O
assassination N
of O
Sheikh O
Ahmed H
Yassin O
, O
the O
leader H
of O
Hamas O
, O
last O
March O
. O

Worse O
for O
Israel O
, O
the O
assassination N
drew O
a O
denunciation N
even O
from O
the O
moderate O
and O
cautious O
Grand O
Ayatollah O
Ali H
Sistani O
, O
who O
wields O
enormous O
moral O
authority N
over O
Iraqi O
Shiites O
. O

These O
Shiite O
movements N
had O
been O
suppressed O
by O
Saddam H
Hussein's O
Hussein H
's H
regime N
, O
but O
have O
now O
organized O
and O
armed O
themselves O
. O

They O
have O
also O
reestablished O
their O
historical O
links N
with O
Lebanese O
and O
Iranian O
Shiites O
. O

It O
is O
inevitable O
that O
most O
Iraqi O
Shiites O
will O
side N
with O
their O
Hizbullah O
coreligionists H
against O
Israel O
, O
and O
it O
seems O
likely O
that O
Iraqi O
Shiites O
will O
get O
rich O
enough O
from O
Iraqi O
petroleum N
sales N
in O
the O
future N
that O
they O
will O
be O
in O
a O
good O
position N
to O
bankroll O
Lebanese O
Shiite O
radicals H
. O

Sunni O
Arab O
fundamentalists H
deeply O
sympathize O
with O
the O
Palestinians O
and O
with O
Hamas O
, O
and O
those O
in O
Iraq O
have O
deep O
historical O
inks N
with O
fundamentalists H
in O
Jordan H
and O
Palestine O
. O

Iraqi O
cities N
such O
as O
Fallujah O
and O
Ramadi O
were O
on O
the O
truck N
route N
from O
Amman O
to O
Baghdad O
, O
and O
so O
came O
under O
the O
influence N
of O
the O
Salafi O
movement N
, O
which O
is O
popular O
in O
Jordan H
. O

Secular O
Arab O
nationalist O
groups N
also O
universally O
sympathize O
with O
the O
Palestinians O
, O
and O
those O
in O
post-Saddam O
Iraq O
are O
no O
exception N
. O

Whereas O
Saddam H
Hussein's O
Hussein H
's H
dictatorship N
ensured O
that O
such O
populist O
currents N
were O
kept O
firmly O
under O
control N
, O
they O
are O
now O
free O
to O
organize O
. O

An O
Iraq O
in O
which O
armed O
fundamentalist O
and O
nationalist O
militias N
proliferate O
is O
inevitably O
a O
security N
worry O
for O
Israel O
. O

If O
even O
a O
modicum N
of O
normality N
and O
security N
can O
be O
returned O
to O
Iraq O
, O
its O
citizens H
will O
be O
able O
to O
benefit N
from O
the O
country's O
country N
's H
petroleum N
reserves N
. O

That O
private O
wealth N
can O
easily O
be O
funneled O
into O
aid N
for O
the O
Palestinians O
and O
for O
Lebanese O
Shiites O
. O

Israel's O
Israel O
's H
security N
interests N
are O
best O
served O
by O
peace N
with O

India O
defensive O
over O

By O

NEW O
DELHI O
- O

While O
India O
is O
ready O
to O
enter O
into O
a O
" O
defense N
cooperation N
agreement N
" O
with O
Sri O
Lanka O
, O
it O
is O
wary O
of O
being O
drawn O
into O
any O
military O
involvement N
in O
the O
island N
nation's O
nation N
's H
two O
decades N
- O
old O
civil O
war N
that O
has O
seen O
violent O
strife N
between O
ethnic O
Tamils O
and O
the O
Sinhalese O
majority N
- O
leaving O
over O
60,000 O
dead O
on O
both O
sides N
. O

And O
that O
explains O
the O
delay N
in O
the O
signing O
of O
a O
formal O
defense N
agreement N
that O
was O
at O
the O
heart N
of O
Sri O
Lankan O
President H
Chandrika O
Kumaratunga's O
Kumaratunga O
's H
four O

to O
India O
recently O

According O
to O
Professor O
S H
D H
Muni O
, O
South O
Asia O
expert H
at O
the O
Jawaharal O
Nehru O
University N
, O
the O
two O

year N
peace N
talks N
between O
Colombo O
and O
the O
Liberation O
Tigers O
of O
Tamil O
Eelam O
( O
LTTE O
) O
are O
stalemated O
. O

For O
that O
reason N
, O
he O
said O
, O
Kumaratunga's O
Kumaratunga O
's H
government N
was O
keen O
to O
beef N
up O
military O
preparedness N
with O
Indian O
support N
. O

" O
The O
Sri O
Lankan O
government N
does O
not O
want O
to O
initiate O
a O
conflict N
but O
would O
be O
interested O
in O
deterring O
the O
LTTE O
from O
starting O
one N
. O

And O
the O
Tigers O
look O
as O
if O
they O
are O
on O
the O
brink N
of O
launching N
another O
offensive O
, O
" O
Muni O
told O
IPS O
. O

Colombo O
held O
six O
rounds N
of O
talks N
with O
the O
Tigers O
between O
September O
2002 O
and O
March O
2003 O
. O

But O
last O
April O
, O
the O
rebels H
abruptly O
pulled O
out O
of O
negotiations N
demanding O
recognition N
, O
first O
, O
for O
the O
right O
to O
self O
- O
rule N
before O
proceeding O
any O
further O
. O

Kumaratunga's O
Kumaratunga O

to O
Sri O

by O
Norwegian O
Foreign O
Minister H
Jan H
Petersen H
in O
a O
new O
bid N
to O
revive O
the O
peace N
talks N
that O
were O
supposed O
to O
follow O
a O
ceasefire O
that O
Oslo O
successfully O
brokered O
in O
February O
2002 O
. O

Petersen H
held O
discussions N
with O
both O
Kumaratunga O
and O
the O
reclusive O
LTTE O
leader H
Velupillai O
Prabhakaran O
in O
the O
rebel H
stronghold N
of O
Kilinochchi O
without O
success N
, O
and O
chief O
Tamil O
rebel H

Anton H
Balasingham O
and O
Norwegian O

Erik H
Solheim O
held O
closed O

late O
Saturday O
in O
an O
effort N
to O
keep O
the O

on O
track N
, O
diplomatic O
sources N
said O
. O

But O
they O
, O
too O
, O
failed O
. O

Colombo O
, O
too O
, O
seems O
to O
be O
in O
an O
intractable O
position N
. O

According O
to O
former O
Indian O
army N
general O
A H
S H
Kalkat O
, O
the O
difficulty N
for O
Kumaratunga's O
Kumaratunga O
's H
government N
lay O
in O
the O
fact N
that O
the O
LTTE O
had O
become O
a O
de O
jure O
power N
in O
the O
north O
and O
east O
of O
the O
island N
and O
was O
running O
every O
aspect N
of O
civil O
administration N
in O
the O
areas N
within O
its O
control N
. O

A H

intervention N
in O
the O
Jaffna O
peninsula N
to O
help O
implement O
the O
1987 O
Indo O
- O
Sri O
Lanka O
Peace N
Accord O
- O
which O
ambitiously O
provided O
for O
the O
disarming N
of O
the O
formidable O
LTTE O
- O
Kalkat O
said O
the O
new O
defense N
deal O
would O
essentially O
be O
a O
reiteration N
of O
the O
older O
one N
minus O
its O
military O
commitment N
. O

Kalkat O
, O
who O
currently O
chairs N
the O
independent O
US O
- O
based O
International O
Council N
on O
Conflict O
Resolution N
, O
said O
despite O
the O
failure N
of O
the O
Indian O
army N
to O
disarm O
or O
even O
subdue O
the O
Tigers O
, O
India O
remained O
the O
only O
power N
capable O
of O
influencing O
the O
course N
of O
the O
current O
peace N
talks N
. O

" O
The O
Norwegians O
mean O
well O
but O
their O
role N
is O
limited O
to O
that O
of O
honest O
broker H
and O
the O
LTTE O
is O
keenly O
aware O
that O
they O
do O
not O
have O
the O
power N
[ O
unlike O
India O
] O
to O
underwrite O
any O
arrangement N
, O
" O
Kalkat O
told O
IPS O
in O
an O
interview N
. O

In O
1987 O
, O
the O
Tamil O
Tigers O
reluctantly O
accepted O
the O
peace N
accord N
under O
Indian O
pressure O
. O

Under O
the O
accord N
, O
a O
new O
northeastern O
provincial O
council N
was O
formed O
and O
the O
Indian O
army N
was O
deployed O
as O
peacekeepers H
in O
the O
north O
and O
east O
. O

However O
, O
differences N
between O
India O
and O
LTTE O
soon O
surfaced O
and O
led O
to O
clashes O
between O
Tiger H
guerrillas H
and O
the O
Indian O
peace N
keeping N
force N
. O

About O
1,200 O
Indian O
soldiers H
were O
killed O
during O
this O
phase N
of O
the O
conflict N
. O

India O
had O
to O
pull O
back O
its O
forces N
from O
Sri O
Lanka O
in O
1989 O
following O
the O
election N
of O
Ranasinghe O
Premadasa O
, O
a O
strong O
critic H
of O
Indian O
mediation N
. O

Last O
June O
, O
an O
international O
initiative N
led O
by O
Japan O
to O
persuade O
the O
LTTE O
to O
come O
back O
to O
the O
negotiating O
table N
failed O
despite O
an O
aid N
package N

of O
US$ O
4.5 O
billion O
. O

Japan's O
Japan O

special O

, O
Yasushi O
Akashi O
, O
who O
called O
for O
tangible O
progress N
in O
the O
peace N

before O
the O
money N
would O
be O
released O
, O
came O
back O
from O
visits N
to O
Colombo O
and O
Kilinochchi O
in O
early O
November O
a O
frustrated O
man H
. O

He O
complained O
about O
the O
" O
visible O
lack N
of O
progress N
" O
and O
reaching O
an O
impasse N
in O
talks N
with O
both O
sides N
. O

The O
Tigers' O
Tigers O
' O
chief O
ideologue H
, O
Balasingham O
, O
sniffed O
at O
the O
proposal N
saying O
that O
" O
a O
solution N
to O
the O
ethnic O
conflict N
cannot O
can O
not O
be O
predetermined O
by O
the O
resolutions N
or O
declarations N
of O
donor H
conferences N
, O
but O
has O
to O
be O
negotiated O
by O
the O
parties N
in O
conflict N
without O
the O
constraints N
of O
external O
forces N
. O
" O

But O
there O
are O
strong O
hints N
in O
the O
country N
that O
a O
new O
Indo O
- O
Sri O

defense N
deal O
could O
be O
in O
the O

And O
this O
has O
already O
drawn O
protests N
from O
the O
Tamil O
National O
Alliance O
( O
TNA O
) O
which O
was O
backed O
by O
the O

in O
the O

" O
TNA O
member N
of O
parliament N
P H
Sithamparanathan O
was O
quoted O
as O
saying O
in O
a O
statement N
. O

She O
added O
that O
recent O
visits N
to O
the O
island N
by O
India's O
India O
's H
top N
military O
brass N
including O
army N
chief O
General O
Nirmal O
Chander O
Vij O
have O
" O
caused O
apprehension N
among O
Tamils O
that O
preparations N
are O
under O
way N
for O
another O
war N
in O
the O
island N
" O
. O

But O
Kalkat O
pointed O
out O
that O
India O
would O
be O
ill O
- O
advised O
to O
be O
involved O
again O
, O
militarily O
, O
with O
Sri O
Lanka O
if O
only O
because O
it O
still O
had O
to O
consider O
the O
sentiments N
of O
45 O
million O
ethnic O
Tamils O
in O
the O
Indian O
state N
of O
Tamil O
Nadu O
- O
separated O
from O
Sri O
Lanka's O
Lanka O
's H
Jaffna O
peninsula N
by O
the O
narrow O
Palk O
Straits O
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
1,200 O
Indian O
lives O
lost O
in O
1987 O
, O
the O
Indian O
peacekeeping N
force N
was O
immensely O
unpopular O
not O
only O
in O
Tamil O

and O
the O

peninsula N
but O
also O
among O
the O
Sinhalese O
majority N
who O
considered O
it O
a O
violation N
of O
their O
country's O
country N
's H
sovereignty N
. O

The O
best O
option N
, O
now O
, O
under O
the O
present N
difficult O
circumstances N
is O
for O
Colombo O
to O
do O
its O
own O
dirty O
work N
, O
although O
New O
Delhi O
can O
always O
be O
counted O
on O
to O
render O
good O
neighborly O
help O
because O
of O
the O
shared O
belief N
that O
religion N

cannot O
can O
not O
be O
the O
basis N
for O

In O
any O
case N

Kalkat O
puts O
it O
succinctly O
: O
" O

Unreported O
by O
the O
international O
media N
, O
the O
Valley N
of O
Kashmir O
has O
seen O
an O
ethnic O
and O
cultural O
genocide N
that O
has O
resulted O
in O
the O
fleeing O
from O
the O
valley N

almost O
all O
the O
Hindu O
families N

have O
been O
living O
there O
since O

Over O

been O
destroyed O

While O
most O
U.S. O
secretaries H
of O
state N
-- O
save O
perhaps O
Dean H
Rusk O
-- O
have O
gobbled O
up O
credit N
for O
outcomes N
that O
they O
had O
little O
to O
do O
with O
, O
few O
have O
been O
as O
brazen O
as O
Colin H
Powell H
. O

Two O
years N
ago O
, O
Pakistani O
President H
Pervez O
Musharraf O
was O
surprised O
when O
the O
leader H
of O
the O
main O
Islamist O
alliance N
-- O
Maulana O
Fazlur O
Rahman H
-- O
visited O
India O
and O
issued O
a O
series N
of O
highly O
conciliatory O
statements N
. O

As O
Pakistan's O
Pakistan O
's H
president H
had O
been O
telling O
the O
United O
States O
he O
was O
" O
forced O
" O
into O
taking O
a O
hawkish O
line N
on O
India O
precisely O
by O
the O
likes O
of O
Rahman H
, O
this O
was O
an O
embarrassment N
. O

The O
reality N
is O
that O
India O
is O
no O
longer O
the O
enemy N
of O
choice N
for O
the O
people N
of O
Pakistan O
. O

That O
distinction N
has O
now O
gone O
to O
the O
United O
States O
. O

Realists H
, O
and O
this O
even O
includes O
members H
of O
the O
U.S. O
Democratic O
foreign O
policy N

such O
as O
Strobe O
Talbott O
, O
who O
have O
long O
sought O
to O
divest O
India O
of O
its O
defensive O
capability N
against O
another O
nuclear O
power N
in O
Asia O
, O
understand O
the O
only O
feasible O
solution N
for O
Kashmir O
is O
the O
acceptance N
of O
the O
status N
quo O
. O

India O
keeps O
what O
it O
has O
while O
Pakistan O
and O
China O
( O
which O
was O
gifted O
a O
slice N
of O
the O
territory N
three O
decades N
ago O
) O
do O
likewise O
. O

Simultaneously O
, O
New O
Delhi O
would O
ensure O
a O
degree N
of O
autonomy N
for O
the O
state N
that O
would O
help O
cut O
popular O
support N
off O
from O
jihadis O
attempting O
to O
convert O
Kashmir O
into O
a O
second N
Afghanistan O
. O

Bill H
Clinton H
understood O
this O
at O
the O
end N
of O
his O
term N
in O
office N
yet O
, O
under O
Colin H
Powell H
( O
who O
appears O
to O
have O
an O
affinity N
for O
generals H
active O
in O
politics N
) O
, O
the O
pendulum N
of O
U.S. O
policy N
has O
once O
again O
swung O
toward O
a O
quixotic O
effort N
to O
prize N
at O
least O
the O
Valley N
of O
Kashmir O
loose O
from O
India O
. O

This O
, O
Pakistan's O
Pakistan O
's H
lobbyist H
in O
Washington O
Christina H
Rocca O
has O
been O
told O
, O
is O
the O
" O
minimum O
" O
that O
the O
Pakistan O
army N
will O
accept O
. O

It O
is O
also O
far O
more O
than O
what O
any O
administration N
in O
New O
Delhi O
can O
deliver O
. O

This O
writer H
has O
for O
years N
regarded O
the O
best O
solution N
to O
the O
Kashmir O
problem N
as O
being O
the O
trifurcation N
of O
the O
Indian O
part N
of O
the O
state N
into O
a O
Hindu O
- O
majority N
Jammu O
, O
a O
Buddhist O
- O
dominated O
Ladakh O
and O
the O
overwhelmingly O
Muslim O
Kashmir O
Valley N
, O
with O
the O
third O
state N

little O
of O
taxpayers' O
taxpayers H
' O
money N

substantial O
autonomy N

With O
luck N
, O
the O
Kashmir O
Valley N
can O
attract O
investment N
from O
the O
Middle O
East O
and O
other O
locations N
where O
Muslims O
are O
dominant O
and O
become O
a O
tourist H

India O

The O
overwhelming O
majority N
of O
Muslims O
in O
Kashmir O
would O
be O
happy O
with O
such O
an O
outcome N
, O
except O
for O
the O
tiny O
jihadi O
segment N
patronized O
by O
the O
U.S. O
State N

Unreported O
by O
the O
international O
media N
, O
the O
Valley N
of O
Kashmir O
has O
seen O
an O
ethnic O
and O
cultural O
genocide N
that O
has O
resulted O
in O
the O
fleeing O
from O
the O
valley N
of O
almost O
all O
the O
Hindu O
families N
who O
have O
been O
living O
there O
since O
human O
habitation N
was O
first O
recorded O
. O

Over O
nine O
dozen N
temples N
that O
had O
served O
the O
Hindu O
population N
have O
been O
destroyed O
, O
with O
some O
used O
as O
building N
material O
and O
others O
used O
as O
urinals N
. O

Thus O
far O
, O
none N
of O
the O
many O
" O
human O
rights N
" O
busybodies H
across O
the O
world N
have O
bothered O
to O
even O
notice O
such O
a O
development N
. O

Indeed O
, O
their O
reports N
are O
filled O
with O
tales N
of O
the O
" O
atrocities N
" O
of O
Indian O
troops N
on O
the O
innocent O
jihadis O
. O

Despite O
Sept. O
11 O
, O
the O
United O
States O
still O
supports O
the O
Kashmir O
groups N
that O
back O
jihad N
as O
part N
of O
the O
price N
Washington O
is O
paying O
to O
keep O
Pervez O
Musharraf O
happy O
. O

Unfortunately O
for O
them O
, O
the O
general O
has O
decided O
to O
take O
seriously O
Colin H
Powell's O
Powell H
's H
frequent O
boasts O
that O
it O
was O
on O
his O
nudging O
that O
the O
Indians H
made O
conciliatory O
gestures N
toward O
Islamabad O
. O

The O
U.S. O
State N
Department O
and O
the O
misnamed O
think O
tanks N
that O
follow O
its O
lead O
have O
held O
numerous O
conferences N
on O
Kashmir O
and O
, O
in O
most O
of O
them O
, O
the O
solution N
that O
has O
emerged O
is O
a O
valley N
prized O
loose O
from O
Indian O
control N
and O
under O
its O
own O
version N
of O
Ibrahim H
Rugova O
. O

That O
India O
is O
not O
Yugoslavia O
and O
that O
the O
" O
foreigner H
- O
led O
" O
Indian O
National O
Congress N
can O
least O
afford O
to O
ignore O
Indian O
nationalism N
, O
has O
not O
struck O
the O
conferees H
, O
among O
whom O
have O
been O
several O
Indian O
" O
scholars H
" O
and O
" O
analysts H
" O
ready O
to O
say O
and O
endorse O
anything O
for O
the O
sake N
of O
a O
free O
trip N
to O
New O
York O
or O
Vienna O
. O

Despite O
many O
wrinkles N
, O
India O
remains O
a O
part N
- O
democracy N
and O
merely O
signing O
on O
to O
a O
piece N
of O
paper N
that O
calls O
for O
an O
independent O
Kashmir O
does O
not O
get O
you H
into O
the O
trouble N
that O
writing N
an O
op O
- O
ed N
piece N
against O
Sonia H
Gandhi H
or O
Atal O
Behari O
Vajpayee O
would O
instantly O
. O

It O
was O
the O
business N
community N
in O
India O
that O
stepped O
in O
after O
Vajpayee O
indulged O
in O
an O
empty O
bout N
of O
saber N
rattling N
in O
2002 O
, O
pointing O
out O
that O
the O
only O
beneficiary H
of O
the O
mythical O
perception N
that O
war N
-- O
especially O
nuclear O
war N
-- O
was O
around O
the O
corner N
in O
the O
subcontinent N
was O
China O
. O

The O
reason N
for O
this O
is O
that O
India O
is O
emerging O
as O
an O
alternative O
investment N
destination N
to O
China O
, O
hence O
the O
favor N
that O
the O
generals H
in O
Islamabad O
do O
to O
their O
trusty O
supplier H
of O
nukes N
and O
missiles N
by O
creating O
a O
scare O
about O
war N
involving O
India O
when O
in O
fact N
the O
real O
flashpoints N
are O
the O
Taiwan O
Straits O
and O
North O
Korea O
. O

Since O
then O
, O
India O
has O
talked O
peace N
while O
always O
signaling O
that O
only O
the O
status N
quo O
would O
be O
acceptable O
as O
a O
final O
settlement N
: O
a O
line N
of O
action N
that O
is O
followed O
in O
the O
case N
of O
disputes N
with O
China O
as O
well O
. O

Unfortunately O
for O
those O
eager O
to O
indefinitely O
carry O
on O
with O
the O
lucrative O
business N
of O
conflict N
resolution N
in O
South O
Asia O
, O
Pervez O
Musharraf O
has O
now O
called O
Colin H
Powell's O
Powell H
's H
bluff N
, O
challenging O
him O
to O
deliver O
on O
his O
frequent O
statements N
implying O
that O
the O
Indians H
jump N
to O
his O
commands N
. O

Once O
the O
Manmohan O
Singh H
government N
shows N
that O
it O
has O
little O
appetite N
for O
suicide N
, O
Musharraf O
will O
face N
the O
moment N
of O
truth N
: O
accept O
the O
inevitable O
, O
or O
once O
again O
ramp O
up O
the O
insurgency N
and O
spawn O
a O
fresh O
lot N
of O
killers H
that O
can O
hit O
not O
merely O
Mumbai O
and O
New O
Delhi O
but O
London O
and O
Chicago O
as O
well O
. O

The O
one N
country N
that O
has O
shown O
that O
it O
understands O
the O
realities N
in O
South O
Asia O
is O
China O
. O

Under O
President H
Hu H
Jintao O
, O
Beijing O
has O
opened O
out O
to O
New O
Delhi O
and O
Prime O
Minister H
Wen H
Jiabao O
is O
expected O
to O
visit O
early O
next O
year N
, O
making O
friends H
by O
formally O
accepting O
Sikkim O
as O
part N
of O
India O
and O
backing O
India O
as O
a O
permanent O
member N
of O
the O
U.N. O

thus O
leaving O

the O
only O
one N
of O
the O
" O
permanent O
five O
" O
that O
has O
not O
yet O
done O
so O
. O

With O
Colin H

around O
, O
the O
U.S. O

no O

We H
all O
know O
that O
John H

served O
in O
Vietnam O
. O

Four O
whole O
months N
, O
after O
which O
he O
took O
advantage N
of O
a O
little O

little O

that O

him O
to O

We H
also O
know O
how O
Dan H

libeled O
George H
Bush H
and O
impugned O
his O
service N
in O
the O
Texas O

on O
a O
" O
60 O

based O
largely O
on O

During O
his O
time N

the O

, O
George H
Bush H
flew O
the O
F O

The O

As O
far O
as O
George H
Bush H
knew O
, O
he O
and O
his O

could O
have O
been O
transferred O
to O

. O

In O
all O
this O
so O

called O
controversy N

has O
anyone O
considered O
that O
perhaps O
George H
Bush H
just O
wanted O
to O
fly O

? O

And O
, O
let's O
let O

remember O
, O
flying O
supersonic O

is O
dangerous O

News O
coverage N
of O
the O
president’s O
president H
’s H
years N
in O
the O
Guard O
has O
tended O
to O
focus O
on O
one N
brief N
portion N
of O
that O
time N
— O
to O
the O
exclusion N
of O
virtually O
everything O
else O
. O

So O
just O
for O
the O
record N
, O
here O
, O
in O
full O
, O
is O
what O
Bush H
did O
: O

The O
future N
president H
joined O
the O
Guard O
in O
May O
1968 O
. O

Almost O
immediately O
, O
he O
began O
an O
extended O
period N
of O
training N
. O

Six O
weeks N
of O
basic O
training N
. O

Fifty O
- O
three O
weeks N
of O
flight N
training N
. O

Twenty O
- O
one N
weeks N
of O
fighter N
- O
interceptor N
training N
. O

That O
was O
80 O
weeks N
to O
begin O
with O
, O
and O
there O
were O
other O
training N
periods N
thrown O
in O
as O
well O
. O

It O
was O
full O
- O
time N
work N
. O

By O
the O
time N
it O
was O
over O
, O
Bush H
had O
served O
nearly O
two O
years N
. O

Not O
two O
years N
of O
weekends N
. O

Two O
years N
. O

After O
training N
, O
Bush H
kept O
flying O
, O
racking O
up O
hundreds N
of O
hours N
in O
F O
- O
102 O
jets O
. O

As O
he O
did O
, O
he O
accumulated O
points O
toward O
his O
National O
Guard O
service N
requirements N
. O

At O
the O
time N
, O
guardsmen H
were O
required O
to O
accumulate O
a O
minimum O
of O
50 O
points O
to O
meet O
their O
yearly O
obligation N
. O

According O
to O
records N
released O
earlier O
this O
year N
, O
Bush H
earned O
253 O
points O
in O
his O
first O
year N
, O
May O
1968 O
to O
May O
1969 O
( O
since O
he O
joined O
in O
May O
1968 O
, O
his O
service N
thereafter O
was O
measured O
on O
a O
May O
- O
to O
- O
May O
basis N
) O
. O

Bush H
earned O
340 O
points O
in O
1969 O
- O
1970 O
. O

[ O
In O
other O
words N
, O
Bush H
earned O
enough O
points O
to O
satisfy O
the O
requirements N
for O
his O
entire O
six O
year N
hitch N
in O
1969 O
- O
1970 O
alone O
. O

- O
acd O
] O

He O
earned O
137 O
points O
in O
1970 O
- O
1971 O
. O

And O
he O
earned O
112 O
points O
in O
1971 O
- O
1972 O
. O

The O
numbers N
indicate O
that O
in O
his O
first O
four O
years N
, O
Bush H
not O
only O
showed O
up O
, O
he O
showed O
up O
a O
lot N
. O

Did O
you H
know O
that O
? O

That O
brings O
the O
story N
to O
May O
1972 O
— O
the O
time N
that O
has O
been O
the O
focus O
of O
so O
many O
news N
reports N
— O
when O
Bush H
“ O
deserted O
” O
( O
according O
to O
anti-Bush O
filmmaker H
Michael H
Moore H
) O
or O
went O
“ O
AWOL O
” O
( O
according O
to O
Terry H
McAuliffe O
, O
chairman H
of O
the O
Democratic O
National O
Committee N
) O
. O

Bush H
asked O
for O
permission N
to O
go O
to O
Alabama O
to O
work N
on O
a O
Senate O
campaign N
. O

His O
superior O
officers H
said O
OK O
. O

Requests N
like O
that O
weren’t O
were O
n’t O
unusual O
, O
says O
retired O
Col. O
William H
Campenni O
, O
who O
flew O
with O
Bush H
in O
1970 O
and O
1971 O
. O

“ O
In O
1972 O
, O
there O
was O
an O
enormous O
glut O
of O
pilots H
, O
” O
Campenni O
says O
. O

“ O
The O
Vietnam O
War N
was O
winding O
down O
, O
and O
the O
Air O
Force O
was O
putting O
pilots H
in O
desk N
jobs N
. O

In O
’72 O
or O
’73 O
, O
if O
you H
were O
a O
pilot O
, O
active O
or O
Guard O
, O
and O
you H
had O
an O
obligation N
and O
wanted O
to O
get O
out O
, O
no O
problem N
. O

In O
fact N
, O
you H
were O
helping O
them O
solve O
their O
problem N
. O
” O

So O
Bush H
stopped O
flying O
. O

From O
May O
1972 O
to O
May O
1973 O
, O
he O
earned O
just O
56 O
points O
— O
not O
much O
, O
but O
enough O
to O
meet O
his O
requirement N
. O

Then O
, O
in O
1973 O
, O
as O
Bush H
made O
plans N
to O
leave O
the O
Guard O
and O
go O
to O
Harvard O
Business N
School N
, O
he O
again O
started O
showing O
up O
frequently O
. O

In O
June O
and O
July O
of O
1973 O
, O
he O
accumulated O
56 O
points O
, O
enough O
to O
meet O
the O
minimum O
requirement N
for O
the O
1973 O
- O
1974 O
year N
. O

Then O
, O
at O
his O
request N
, O
he O
was O
given O
permission N
to O
go O
. O

Bush H
received O
an O
honorable O
discharge N
after O
serving O
five O
years N
, O
four O
months N
and O
five O
days N
of O
his O
original O
six O
- O
year N
commitment N
. O

By O
that O
time N
, O
however O
, O
he O
had O
accumulated O
enough O
points O
in O
each O
year N
to O
cover O
six O
years N
of O
service N
. O

During O
his O
service N
, O
Bush H
received O
high O
marks O
as O
a O
pilot O
. O

A H
1970 O
evaluation N
said O
Bush H
“ O
clearly O
stands O
out O
as O
a O
top N
notch N
fighter N
interceptor N
pilot O
” O
and O
was O
“ O
a O
natural O
leader H
whom O
his O
contemporaries H
look O
to O
for O
leadership N
. O
” O

A H
1971 O
evaluation N
called O
Bush H
“ O
an O
exceptionally O
fine O
young O
officer H
and O
pilot O
” O
who O
“ O
continually O
flies O
intercept N
missions N
with O
the O
unit N
to O
increase O
his O
proficiency N
even O
further O
. O
” O

And O
a O
1972 O
evaluation N
called O
Bush H
“ O
an O
exceptional O
fighter N
interceptor N
pilot O
and O
officer H
. O
” O

Now O
, O
it O
is O
only O
natural O
that O
news N
reports N
questioning O
Bush’s O
Bush H
’s H
service N
— O
in O
The O
Boston O
Globe N
and O
The O
New O
York O
Times O
, O
on O
CBS O
and O
in O
other O
outlets N
— O
would O
come O
out O
now O
. O

Democrats O
are O
spitting O
mad O
over O
attacks N
on O
John H
Kerry’s O
Kerry H
’s H
record N
by O
the O
group N
Swift O
Boat O
Veterans O
for O
Truth O
. O

And O
, O
as O
it O
is O
with O
Kerry H
, O
it’s O
it O
’s H
reasonable O
to O
look O
at O
a O
candidate’s O
candidate H
’s H
entire O
record N
, O
including O
his O
military O
service N
— O
or O
lack N
of O
it O
. O

Voters H
are O
perfectly O
able O
to O
decide O
whether O
it’s O
it O
’s H
important O
or O
not O
in O
November O
. O

The O
Kerry H
camp N
blames O
Bush H
for O
the O
Swift O
boat N
veterans’ O
veterans H
’ O
attack N
, O
but O
anyone O
who O
has O
spent O
much O
time N
talking O
to O
the O
Swifties O
gets O
the O
sense N
that O
they O
are O
doing O
it O
entirely O
for O
their O
own O
reasons N
. O

And O
it O
should O
be O
noted O
in O
passing O
that O
Kerry H
has O
personally O
questioned O
Bush’s O
Bush H
’s H
service N
, O
while O
Bush H
has O
not O
personally O
questioned O
Kerry’s O
Kerry H
’s H
. O

In O
April O
— O
before O
the O
Swift O
boat N
veterans H
had O
said O
a O
word N
— O
Kerry H
said O
Bush H
“ O
has O
yet O
to O
explain O
to O
America O
whether O
or O
not O
, O
and O
tell O
the O
truth N
, O
about O
whether O
he O
showed O
up O
for O
duty N
. O
” O

Earlier O
, O
Kerry H
said O
, O
“ O
Just O
because O
you H
get O
an O
honorable O
discharge N
does O
not O
, O
in O
fact N
, O
answer N
that O
question N
. O
” O

Now O
, O
after O
the O
Swift O
boat N
episode N
, O
the O
spotlight O
has O
returned O
to O
Bush H
. O

That’s O
That O
’s H
fine O
. O

We H
should O
know O
as O
much O
as O
we H
can O
. O

And O
perhaps O
someday O
Kerry H
will O
release N
more O
of O
his O
military O
records N
as O
well O
. O

Byron H
York H
is O
a O
White O
House O
correspondent H
for O
National O
Review N
. O

His O
column N
appears O
in O
The O
Hill O
each O
week N
. O

One O
week N
to O
elections N
day N
and O
the O
general O
atmosphere N
in O
the O
capital N
is O
eerie O
, O
yet O
strikingly O
familiar O
. O

I H
suspect O
the O
streets N
of O
Baghdad O
will O
look O
as O
if O
a O
war N
is O
looming O
this O
week N
. O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
many O
Iraqis O
regard N
the O
date N
of O
30 O
January O
as O
a O
day N
of O
renewed O
hope O
, O
one N
they O
have O
been O
awaiting O
all O
their O
lives O
, O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time N
, O
many O
others O
are O
already O
dreading O
it O
. O

The O
interim O
government N
has O
promised O
security N
measures N
that O
would O
reduce O
the O
violence N
on O
the O
day N
of O
elections N
, O
but O
I H
fail O
to O
see O
how O
they O
will O
be O
able O
to O
protect O
all O
5,000 O
( O
or O
so O
) O
balloting N
centres N
. O

Many O
voting O
centres N
have O
already O
been O
successfully O
attacked O
or O
destroyed O
in O
many O
areas N
. O

Now O
that O
the O
picture N
is O
clear N
, O
the O
two O
main O
competing O
lists O
seem O
to O
be O
the O
United O
Iraqi O
Coalition O
list N
and O
Allawi's O
Allawi O
's H
Al H
- O
Iraqiya O
list N
. O

Ayad O
Allawi O
, O
and O
other O
ministers H
running O
on O
his O
list N
, O
have O
quite O
expectedly O
used O
their O
governmental O
positions N
in O
campaigning O
. O

One O
minister H
reportedly O
handed O
out O
100 O
dollar N
' O
gifts N
' O
to O
journalists H
attending O
a O
press N
conference N
for O
Allawi O
, O
a O
practice O
that O
brings O
back O
bad O
memories N
to O
many O
Iraqis O
. O

Sheikh O
Naji O
Al H
- O
Abbudi O
, O
a O
spokesman H
for O
Sistani O
, O
affirmed O
the O
claims N
that O
the O
Grand O
Ayatollah O
is O
backing O
the O
United O
Iraqi O
Coalition O
list N
. O

Indeed O
, O
Sistani's O
Sistani O
's H
agents H
all O
over O
the O
country N
have O
been O
quite O
active O
in O
educating O
Iraqi O
Shia O
on O
the O
merits N
of O
elections N
, O
which O
has O
led O
to O
the O
assassination N
of O
at O
least O
two O
of O
them O
. O

Al H
- O
Abbudi O
stated O
that O
" O
His O
Emminence O
" O
decided O
to O
openly O
support N
the O
list N
because O
" O
others O
" O
( O
obviously O
a O
reference N
to O
Allawi O
) O
have O
been O
abusing O
official O
state N
positions N
and O
media N
outlets N
in O
their O
campaigning O
. O

Again O
there O
is O
no O
official O
written O
statement N
from O
Sistani's O
Sistani O
's H
office N
confirming O
this O
allegation N
, O
which O
I H
think O
is O
intentional O
. O

Ahmed H
Al H
- O
Chalabi O
and O
defense N
minister H
Hazim O
Al H
- O
Sha'lan O
have O
been O
engaging O
in O
shrill O
public O
attacks N
over O
the O
media N
. O

Chalabi O
describing O
Sha'lan O
as O
a O
" O
Ba'athist O
" O
and O
a O
" O
former O
double O
agent H
for O
Saddam H
and O
the O
CIA O
" O
, O
while O
Sha'lan O
dismisses O
Chalabi O
as O
a O
" O
thief H
" O
and O
an O
" O
Iranian O
stooge H
who O
longs O
for O
his O
own O
origins N
by O
defending O
Iran O
" O
. O

One O
remark N
made O
by O
Sha'lan O
on O
Al H
- O
Arabiya O
TV N
, O
that O
he O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
say O
more O
about O
Chalabi O
because O
he O
would O
embarrass O
himself O
and O
the O
viewers H
almost O
made O
me H
roll O
on O
the O
floor N
. O

It O
was O
an O
extremely O
amusing O
episode N
, O
watching O
Chalabi O
looking O
smug O
and O
amused O
, O
contrasted O
with O
Sha'lan O
, O
all O
serious O
and O
barely O
keeping N
himself O
from O
swearing N
. O

Fistfights N
, O
please O
. O

Hazim O
Al H
- O
Sha'lan O
, O
by O
the O
way N
, O
is O
the O
son H
of O
the O
late O
Sheikh O
of O
Al H
- O
Khaza'il O
in O
Diwaniya O
and O
has O
the O
potential N
to O
replace O
former O
information N
minister H
, O
M.S. O
Al H
- O
Sahaf O
, O
in O
his O
nonsensical O
media N
statements N
, O
which O
can O
be O
passed O
as O
jokes N
. O

The O
main O
Kurdish O
coalition N
list N
( O
PUK O
and O
KDP O
) O
is O
barely O
mentioned O
outside O
the O
Kurdish O
region N
. O

Even O
there O
, O
many O
Kurds O
look O
and O
act N
as O
if O
they O
are O
going O
to O
grab O
the O
chance N
to O
vote N
them O
out O
of O
power N
. O

I H
doubt O
that O
will O
be O
the O
outcome N
though O
. O

Many O
Iraqis O
, O
including O
conservative O
and O
religious O
Iraqis O
, O
are O
surprisingly O
rooting O
for O
the O
Iraqi O
Communist O
party N
, O
probably O
in O
an O
attempt N
to O
counter N
the O
influence N
of O
Islamists O
in O
the O
forthcoming O
National O
Assembly N
. O

The O
Communist O
party N
has O
the O
largest O
number N
of O
registered O
party N
members H
in O
the O
country N
and O
can O
be O
considered O
as O
the O
oldest O
popular O
political O
party N
in O
Iraq O
. O

Its O
support N
base N
is O
much O
larger O
than O
what O
it O
seems O
. O

*** O

Several O
candidates H
were O
assassinated O
and O
targeted O
these O
last O
two O
weeks N
, O
others O
have O
been O
forced O
under O
threats N
to O
withdraw O
and O
to O
follow O
the O
example N
of O
the O
Islamic O
party N
. O

Sectarian O
tensions N
are O
at O
their O
highest O
since O
April O
, O
2004 O
, O
with O
Sunni O
insurgents H
now O
openly O
attacking O
Husseiniyas O
and O
Shia O
mosques N
. O

I H
had O
an O
interesting O
conversation N
with O
a O
middle O
- O
aged O
taxi N
driver H
who O
used O
to O
live O
in O
Fallujah O
and O
is O
now O
at O
relatives A
in O
Amiriya O
, O
Baghdad O
. O

After O
asking O
me H
which O
tribe N
I H
belong O
to O
( O
thus O
assessing O
my H
sectarian O
background N
) O
he O
started O
hurling O
abuses N
at O
the O
Shia O
, O
calling O
them O
Persians H
, O
Majoos O
( O
fire N
worshippers H
) O
, O
rabid O
dogs A
and O
a O
handful N
of O
other O
descriptions N
that O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
mention N
here O
. O

He O
described O
Allawi's O
Allawi O
's H
face N
as O
that O
of O
a O
f*ed O
horse A
and O
he O
dismissed O
the O
whole O
government N
as O
a O
band N
of O
thieves H
and O
traitors H
. O

I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
argue O
with O
him O
but O
I H
asked O
him O
what O
he O
believed O
would O
be O
a O
viable O
solution N
to O
this O
mess N
. O

He O
said O
that O
resistance N
was O
the O
only O
commonsense O
solution N
. O

First O
driving O
out O
the O
Americans O
, O
then O
fighting O
the O
Shia O
back O
into O
submission N
( O
as O
in O
1991 O
) O
. O

Sunni O
Iraqis O
contend O
that O
elections N
are O
impossible O
to O
hold O
under O
occupation N
. O

Leaving O
aside O
the O
fact N
that O
this O
views N
conflicts N
with O
other O
historical O
examples N
in O
the O
region N
, O
Sunnis O
have O
never O
offered O
an O
alternative O
choice N
, O
which O
eventually O
leads O
one N
to O
guess O
that O
the O
opinion N
held O
by O
the O
Fallujan O
taxi N
driver H
above O
is O
precisely O
what O
they O
are O
planning O
to O
implement O
. O

I H
had O
another O
conversation N
some O
months N
ago O
with O
a O
retired O
Ba'athist O
old O
- O
timer N
who O
claimed O
that O
Ba'athists O
have O
the O
means N
to O
stage N
a O
third O
coup O
d'etat O
and O
return O
to O
power N
within O
10 O
hours N
of O
an O
American O
withdrawal N
. O

On O
sensing N
my H
incredulity N
to O
his O
statement N
he O
asserted O
that O
Ba'athist O
cells N
exist O
in O
all O
parts N
of O
the O
country N
and O
that O
they O
do O
have O
a O
central O
command O
, O
even O
though O
many O
have O
formed O
seperate O
cells N
( O
often O
under O
Islamic O
labels N
) O
with O
their O
own O
leaderships N
. O

He O
said O
that O
they O
have O
the O
training N
and O
the O
funding N
as O
well O
as O
the O
support N
of O
neighbouring O
and O
regional O
governments N
. O

I H
concur O
that O
Ba'athists O
and O
former O
security N
forces N
are O
capable O
of O
immediately O
controlling O
at O
least O
5 O
out O
of O
18 O
governorates O
, O
along O
with O
the O
capital N
, O
if O
Americans O
are O
to O
be O
removed O
from O
the O
picture N
entirely O
. O

But O
I H
also O
see O
that O
as O
a O
fatal O
misconception N
, O
which O
is O
doing O
Sunnis O
harm O
, O
because O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
believe O
the O
US O
is O
going O
anywhere O
so O
soon O
. O

Any O
government N
that O
assumes O
power N
after O
the O
elections N
also O
realises O
this O
, O
so O
not O
even O
Sistani O
is O
going O
to O
call O
the O
US O
to O
withdraw O
its O
troops N
, O
despite O
what O
he O
is O
saying O
now O
, O
not O
until O
they O
are O
ensured O
the O
insurgency N
is O
out O
of O
the O
picture N
, O
or O
that O
they O
have O
an O
alternative O
foreign O
power N
( O
in O
this O
case N
Iran O
) O
to O
back O
them O
up O
. O

The O
only O
hope O
now O
is O
that O
, O
following O
the O
elections N
, O
the O
National O
Assembly N
would O
offer O
the O
hand N
of O
peace N
and O
reconciliation N
to O
the O
dissenting O
parties N
. O

I H
would O
suggest O
going O
for O
tribal O
Sheikhs H
rather O
than O
clerics H
, O
since O
they O
have O
the O
upper O
hand N
in O
their O
areas N
and O
can O
effectively O
root N
out O
any O
Ba'athists O
in O
their O
midst N
in O
return O
for O
a O
promise N
of O
sharing N
power N
and O
authority N
. O

Many O
of O
these O
Sheikhs H
have O
been O
disenfranchised O
and O
abused O
over O
the O
last O
two O
years N
. O

Very O
recently O
, O
US O
forces N
in O
Al H
- O
Anbar O
made O
a O
terrible O
blunder N
by O
accidentally O
killing O
Abdul H
- O
Razaq O
Inad O
Al H
- O
Gu'ud O
, O
Sheikh O
of O
the O
Al H
- O
Bu O
Nimr O
clan H
from O
the O
powerful O
Dulaym O
tribe N
. O

Al H
- O
Gu'ud O
had O
favoured O
elections N
and O
was O
in O
good O
terms N
with O
the O
government N
. O

The O
Gu'ud O
family H
even O
accepted O
to O
be O
offered O
the O
seat N
of O
Al H
- O
Anbar O
governor H
some O
months N
back O
. O

The O
Al H
- O
Bu O
Nimr O
in O
Ramadi O
and O
Al H
- O
Qaim O
rose O
in O
arms N
against O
Saddam H
in O
the O
mid-nineties N
following O
the O
execution N
of O
Thamir O
Madhlum O
Al H
- O
Dulaymi O
, O
an O
Air O
Force O
general O
belonging O
to O
their O
tribe N
. O

The O
revolt N
took O
two O
weeks N
to O
be O
suppressed O
by O
the O
Republican O
Guard O
. O

Another O
bad O
step O
was O
the O
recent O
arrest N
of O
Sheikh O
Hassan H
Al H
- O
Lihabi O
, O
of O
the O
Lihaib O
tribe N
which O
is O
scattered O
between O
the O
governorates O
of O
Al H
- O
Anbar O
, O
Mosul O
and O
Salah O
Al H
- O
Din O
. O

Al H
- O
Lihaibi O
was O
running O
in O
elections N
and O
is O
now O
said O
to O
have O
withdrawn O
following O
this O
incident N
. O

I H
believe O
national O
reconciliation N
to O
be O
the O
only O
path N
forward O
to O
a O
new O
Iraq O
. O

The O
Shia O
cannot O
can O
not O
live O
without O
the O
Sunnis O
, O
and O
vice O
versa O
. O

Both O
have O
shared O
this O
country N
for O
the O
last O
14 O
centuries N
and O
there O
is O
no O
possible O
way N
that O
one N
can O
live O
without O
the O
other O
. O

Even O
partition O
is O
not O
a O
possibility N
, O
there O
are O
no O
clear N
borders N
between O
the O
two O
. O

Remember O
Luis H
Posada O
Carriles O
? O

Here's O
Here O
's H
a O
Miami O
Herald O
interview N
with O
the O
relaxed O
terrorist H
and O
former O
CIA O
operative H
in O
a O
luxury O
condo N
, O
published O
yesterday N
. O

( O
" O
At O
first O
I H
hid O
a O
lot N
. O

I H
thought O
the O
US O
government N
was O
looking O
for O
me H
. O

Now O
I H
hide N
a O
lot N
less O
. O
" O
) O

Because O
of O
such O
talk O
, O
Posada O
has O
been O
taken O
into O
custody N
by O
Immigration O
officials O
. O

I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
they O
wanted O
to O
do O
this O
. O

Authorities H
would O
likely O
have O
been O
happy O
answering O
questions N
about O
Posada's O
Posada O
's H
whereabouts N
with O
an O
indefinite O
shrug N
. O

As O
recently O
as O
last O
week N
the O
official O
line N
stated O
they O
had O
no O
knowledge N
he O
had O
entered O
the O
country N
. O

But O
comfortable O
among O
the O
thugs H
, O
Posada O
overplayed O
his O
hand N
and O
embarrassed O
his O
old O
patron H
, O
the O
US O
government N
. O

And O
though O
he'd O
he O
'd O
been O
a O
faithful O
servant H
, O
he O
was O
not O
such O
a O
player H
that O
he O
could O
get O
away O
with O
that O
. O

He O
should O
have O
taken O
a O
cue N
from O
another O
bomber H
some O
pesky O
dark O
- O
skinned O
foreigners H
want O
extradited O
, O
CIA O
operative H
Michael H
Meiring O
. O

Posada O
should O
have O
told O
any O
inquisitive O
journalist H
at O
his O
doorstep N
something O
like O
Meiring O
told O
the O
single O
American O
reporter H
who O
bothered O
following O
his O
bloody O
trail N
from O
the O
Philippines O
, O
that O
" O
If O
this O
harms O
me H
in O
any O
way N
, O
you H
will O
find O
my H
power N
then O
, O
and O
you'll O
you H
'll O
find O
out O
who O
I H
am O
. O
" O

But O
then O
, O
maybe O
that O
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
have O
saved O
him O
either O
, O
because O
Posada O
is O
not O
Meiring O
. O

Posada O
can O
be O
given O
up O
, O
but O
Meiring O
can't O
ca O
n't O
. O

Meiring's O
Meiring O
's H
crimes N
are O
fresh O
, O
and O
wave N
the O
false O
flag N
which O
is O
the O
" O
War N
on O
Terror O
. O
" O

They O
happened O
in O
the O
Philippines O
which O
, O
like O
Pakistan O
, O
is O
an O
important O
and O
vulnerable O
node N
for O
the O
business N
which O
intelligence N
agencies N
and O
terrorist H
organizations N
conduct O
with O
each O
other O
. O

( O
Ask O
Terry H
Nichols H
about O
the O
Philippines O
. O
) O

The O
bombings N
implicated O
Muslims O
, O
and O
exacerbated O
regional O
tensions N
which O
the O
Bush H
regime N
and O
its O
friends H
wearing O
the O
brass N
in O
the O
Philippine O
military O
sought O
to O
exploit O
. O

Posada's O
Posada O
's H
crimes N
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand N
, O
must O
seem O
like O
ancient O
history N
, O
especially O
to O
a O
people N
who O
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
their O
history N
. O

And O
to O
those O
who O
don't O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
their O
crimes N
, O
not O
even O
that O
. O

But O
will O
Posada O
be O
given O
up O
? O

I H
doubt O
he O
will O
be O
extradited O
to O
Venezuela O
, O
which O
is O
the O
only O
way N
that O
question N
could O
be O
answered O
with O
a O
Yes O
. O

I H
expect O
it O
will O
be O
determined O
that O
, O
under O
" O
Strong O
Man H
" O
Hugo H
Chavez O
, O
Posada O
could O
not O
be O
guaranteed O
a O
fair O
trial N
. O

The O
hope O
may O
be O
that O
Posada O
can O
soon O
be O
offered O
to O
a O
post-Chavez O
Allawi O
- O
like O
puppet N
in O
Caracas O
. O

Whether O
such O
an O
offer O
were O
accepted O
or O
declined O
would O
make O
no O
difference N
; O
justice N
would O
not O
be O
served O
then O
. O

But O
Posada's O
Posada O
's H
nearly O
80 O
years N
old O
, O
and O
the O
Venezuelan O
people N
will O
ensure O
that's O
that O
's H
a O
vain O
hope O
. O

So O
instead O
Posada O
may O
be O
held O
indefinitely O
, O
in O
comfortable O
custody N
. O

An O
embarrassment N
to O
the O
US O
still O
, O
just O
not O
as O
embarrassing O
as O
having O
the O
old O
killer H
strut O
about O
Miami O
, O
gloating O
in O
his O
freedom N
. O

Meiring O
is O
more O
than O
an O
embarrassment N
. O

His O
case N
threatens O
the O
consensus N
fiction N
of O
the O
" O
War N
on O
Terror O
. O
" O

So O
his O
name N
will O
remain O
unspoken O
. O

Another O
connection N
to O
Philippine O
terror N
and O
weapons N
smuggling O
- O
dating O
from O
the O
1980s N
- O
is O
alleged O
in O
the O
book O
Disposable O
Patriot O
, O
by O
Jack H
Terrell O
. O

Terrell O
, O
a O
CIA O
asset N
originally O
recruited O
for O
the O
Contra O
effort N
, O
identifies O
the O
man H
attempting O
to O
recruit O
him O
into O
the O
Philippine O
scheme N
as O
Oliver H
North H
... O

I H
seem O
to O
recall O
the O
object N
was O
to O
smuggle O
explosives N

Due O
to O
the O
Judge O
in O
the O
1983 O
case N
ruling N
that O
a O
CIA O
agent H
could O
not O
testify O
using O
a O
pseudonym N
, O
therefore O
opening N
him O
to O
cross-examination N
by O
Wilson H
, O
the O
prosecution N
had O
a O
problem N
. O

They O
needed O
someone H
that O
could O
convince O
the O
jury N
they O
had O
been O
able O
to O
see O
all O

documents N

Wilson H
was O
claiming O
that O

working O
for O
the O
CIA O
when O
he O
sold O
the O
C N

to O

The O
prosecution N
was O
charging O
he O
was O
a O
rogue H
using O
his O
contacts N
from O
former O
service N
in O
both O
CIA O
and O
the O
' O
Office O

. O

Wilson H
had O
been O
able O
to O
show O
that O
he'd O
he O
'd O
had O
more O
than O
80 O
" O
non-social O
contacts N

that O
on O

Andamans O

demand N
for O
them O
in O
any O
case N
, O
they O
turn O
to O
smuggling O
and O
other O
unlawful O
activities N

The O
presence N
of O
the O
Sea N
Tigers O
in O
the O
area N
with O
guns N

makes O
the O
situation N
extremely O
dangerous O
. O

Reports N
from O
Port O

make O
it O
evident O
that O
New O
Delhi O
gets O
little O
on O
- O
the O
- O
ground N
intelligence N
, O
and O
the O
Indian O
Coast O
Guard O
is O
grossly O
unequipped O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
surge N
of O
illegal O
migrants H
to O
the O
islands N
. O

One O
unnamed O
naval O
officer H
was O
quoted O
saying O
, O
" O
Arms O
smuggling O
is O
a O
very O
profitable O
business N
in O
this O
region N
. O
" O

Considering O
the O
islands' O
islands N
' O
huge O
strategic O
importance N
, O
it O
is O
amazing O
how O
lax O
New O
Delhi O
has O
been O
. O

These O
islands N
sit O
aside O
the O
vital O
sea N
lanes N
of O
the O
Strait O
of O
Malacca O
, O
through O
which O
300 O

Intelligence O
lapses N

As O
the O
implications N
of O
the O
Andaman O
Islands N
situation N
sink N
in O
, O
Indian O
intelligence N
has O
inevitably O
come O
under O
scrutiny N
. O

In O
recent O
months N
, O
its O
fallibility N
has O
become O
evident O
. O

The O
inability N

foresee O
in O

the O
assassination N
attempt N
on O
the O
pro-India O
political O
leader H

former O
Bangladeshi O

last O

at O

the O
recent O

" O
by O
Nepalese O
King O
Gyanendra O
dismissing O
his O

and O
imposing O
a O
virtual O

, O
are O
glaring O
examples N
of O
intelligence N
failure N
. O

With O
growing O
economic O

military O
power N

India O
will O
be O
dependent O
on O
smaller O
nations N
in O
the O

to O

its O

it O
will O
not O
generate O
much O
confidence N
in O
the O

In O
fact N
, O
it O
would O
tend O
to O

‘’ O
It O
was O
the O

An O
Afghan O
official O
at O

‘’ O
The O

realise O
that O

a O
clear N

Until O
then O
he O
had O
said O
Pakistan’s O
Pakistan O

options N

open O

However O
Pakistani O
officials O
insist O
that O
the O
decision N
was O
unconnected O
to O
the O
tripartite O
meeting N
. O

US O
and O
NATO O
military O
officers H
in O
Kabul O
say O
it O
is O
too O
early O
to O
say O
whether O
Bush’s O
Bush H

tough O
message N

instrumental O
in O
persuading O
Musharraf O

the O

to O
pressure O
the O
Taliban O
to O
restrain O
from O
disrupting O
the O

However O
there O
were O
visible O
signs N
of O
a O
crackdown N
on O
the O
Pakistan O
side N
. O

‘’ O
Pakistan O
now O
has O
a O

However O
US O
military O
officers H
say O
regular O
army N
officers H
- O
many O
of O
them O
Pashtun O
- O
leading N
units N
of O
the O
Frontier O
Corps O
who O
are O
on O
the O
border N
remain O
deeply O
sympathetic O
to O
the O
Taliban O
and O
the O
mullahs H
of O
the O
JUI O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time N
the O
US O
remains O
oblivious O
of O
the O
serious O
problems N
and O
political O
fallout N
which O
the O
army N
is O
facing O
in O
its O
operations N
in O
Waziristan O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
army N
facing O
serious O
political O
fallout N
, O
growing O
anti-Americanism O
and O
anti-army O
feeling O
in O
the O
tribal O
areas N
but O
it O
is O
also O
taking O
heavy O
casualties H
- O
between O
400 O
- O
500 O
Pakistani O
soldiers H
have O
been O
killed O
in O
the O
region N
since O
March O
. O

Musharraf O
has O
always O
maintained O
that O
the O
US O
has O
never O
provided O
actionable O
intelligence N
about O
Taliban O
leaders H
hiding O
in O
Baluchistan O
. O

That O
too O
may O
change O
. O

US O
and O
Afghan O
intelligence N
will O
shortly O
be O
presenting O
the O
ISI O
with O
a O
list N
of O
Taliban O
extremists H
and O
their O
suspected O
whereabouts N
. O

Moreover O
there O
are O
now O
major O
covert O
attempts N
under O
way N
to O
try O
and O
bring O
back O
to O
Kabul O
leading N
Taliban O
commanders H
, O
who O
have O
been O
living O
quietly O
in O
Pakistan O
and O
have O
taken O
no O
part N
in O
the O
Taliban O
insurgency N
. O

With O
the O
Taliban O
failure N
to O
disrupt O
the O
Afghan O
elections N
, O
the O
militants H
are O
even O
more O
isolated O
from O
the O
mainstream O
Taliban O
who O
want O
to O
return O
home N
. O

Until O
now O
Pakistan O
has O
not O
facilitated O
such O
a O
return O
and O
clearly O
it O
cannot O
can O
not O
happen O
until O
there O
is O
both O
a O
pull O
from O
Kabul O
and O
a O
push O
from O
Islamabad O
. O

With O
President H
Karzai O
certain O
to O
win O
the O
elections N
and O
the O
demotion N
of O
key N
former O
Northern O
Alliance O
figures N
such O
as O
General O
Fahim O
and O
warlord H
Ismail H
Khan H
, O
there O
is O
now O
little O
reason N
for O
moderate O
Taliban O
leaders H
to O
fear N
reprisals N
from O
former O
Northern O
Alliance O
figures N
if O
they O
return O
home N
. O

Their O
removal N
should O
also O
provide O
increased O
motivation N
for O
Pakistan O
to O
help O
the O
return O
of O
moderate O
Taliban O
. O

Afghan O
officials O
welcomed O
the O
appointment N
on O
October O
3 O
of O
Lt. O
General O
Ashfaq O
Kiyani O
as O
the O
new O
ISI O
chief O
. O

Kayani O
is O
well O
known O
and O
liked O
in O
Kabul O
as O
during O
the O
last O
year N
he O
led O
the O
Pakistani O
delegation N
in O
the O
tripartite O
military O
meetings N
with O
the O
Afghan O
and O
US O
military O
on O
issues N
related O
to O
border N
issues N
. O

Karzai O
also O
has O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
stepped O
up O
rivalry N
between O
India O
and O
Pakistan O
in O
Afghanistan O
. O

Islamabad O
accuses O
New O
Delhi O
of O
using O
its O
consulates N
in O
Kandahar O
and O
Jalalabad O
to O
train N
Balochi O
insurgents H
who O
are O
active O
in O
Pakistani O
Balochistan O
. O

Pakistani O
officials O
claim O
there O
are O
as O
many O
as O
42 O
RAW O
agents H
based O
in O
Kandahar O
and O
another O
12 O
in O
Jalalabad O
. O

“ O
There O
have O
no O
business N
being O
there O
unless O
they O
are O
undermining O
Pakistan O
, O
’’ O
says O
a O
Pakistani O
official O
. O

Both O
India O
and O
Afghanistan O
deny O
the O
claim O
. O

‘’ O
Should O
Pakistan O
show O
us H
any O
evidence N
of O
an O
Indian O
hand N
using O
Afghan O
soil N
to O
work N
against O
our H
neighbours H
we H
will O
take O
it O
very O
seriously O
, O
” O
says O
Amrullah O
Saleh O
the O
head N
of O
Afghanistan’s O
Afghanistan O
’s H
National O
Security N
Directorate O
. O

Karzai O
categorically O
said O
that O
he O
has O
assured O
Musharraf O
repeatedly O
that O
any O
adverse O
action N
against O
Pakistan O
taken O
by O
Indian O
diplomats H
inside O
Afghanistan O
would O
be O
acted O
upon O
swiftly O
. O

Senior O
US O
diplomats H
and O
military O
officials O
have O
warned O
India O
also O
. O

In O
a O
major O
regional O
shift N
reflecting O
the O
newly O
strengthened O
position N
of O
Karzai O
, O
Iran O
, O
Russia O
and O
India O
which O
have O
traditionally O
backed O
the O
Tajik O
dominated O
former O
Northern O
Alliance O
made O
strenuous O
efforts N
to O
convince O
presidential O
candidate H
Younis O
Qanooni O
to O
strike N
a O
deal O
with O
Karzai O
before O
the O
elections N
and O
not O
to O
oppose O
Karzai O
. O

Iran O
in O
particular O
feared O
that O
Qanooni O
would O
loose O
and O
then O
be O
politically O
isolated O
from O
the O
mainstream O
. O

Qanooni O
refused O
to O
accept O
the O
Iranian O
advice N
as O
his O
fellow H
Panjsheri O
Tajiks O
urged O
him O
to O
stand O
against O
Karzai O
. O

However O
since O
the O
elections N
Iranian O
influence N
has O
proved O
critical O
in O
convincing O
the O
Hazara O
Shia O
candidate H
Mohammed H
Mohaqeq O
to O
accept O
the O
results N
of O
the O
elections N
and O
later O
convincing O
Qanooni O
to O
do O
the O
same O
. O

With O
the O
US O
military O
presence N
posing O
a O
threat N
on O
their O
borders N
in O
both O
Iraq O
and O
Afghanistan O
, O
Iran’s O
Iran O
’s H
moderate O
leadership N
is O
keen O
to O
help O
stabilise O
Karzai O
so O
that O
the O
US O
presence N
in O
Afghanistan O
is O
reduced O
. O

However O
powerful O
hardliners H
in O
Tehran O
may O
be O
trying O
to O
undermine O
that O
strategy N
and O
a O
new O
issue N
is O
likely O
to O
deepen O
the O
rift N
with O
the O
moderates H
. O

Iranian O
officials O
are O
deeply O
concerned O
about O
the O
US O
occupation N
of O
Shindand O
, O
a O
massive O
Soviet O
- O
era N
airbase O
just O
30 O
kilometres N
from O
Iran’s O
Iran O
’s H
border N
. O

The O
enhanced O
US O
presence N
in O
western O
Afghanistan O
was O
only O
made O
possible O
after O
the O
ousting N
of O
Ismail H
Khan H
, O
the O
warlord H
and O
Governor H
of O
Herat O
province N
last O
month N
, O
who O
was O
a O
close O
ally H
of O
Iranian O
hardliners H
. O

Iranian O
officials O
say O
they O
made O
no O
objections N
to O
Khan’s O
Khan H
’s H
ouster H
because O
they O
want O
to O
strengthen O
Karzai’s O
Karzai O
’s H
campaign N
against O
warlords H
. O

At O
a O
time N
of O
heightened O
tensions N
between O
Tehran O
and O
Washington O
over O
Iran’s O
Iran O
’s H
nuclear O
weapons N
program N
and O
calls O
by O
neo-conservatives O
in O
Washington O
that O
a O
second N
Bush H
term N
should O
deal O
with O
Iran O
aggressively O
, O
the O
Iranians O
fear N
that O
Shindand O
could O
be O
used O
as O
a O
listening O
post N
, O
spying N
facility N
and O
even O
a O
launching N
pad N
for O
any O
future N
US O
actions N
against O
Iran O
. O

Afghan O
officials O
say O
the O
Americans O
have O
moved O
over O
100 O
Special O
Forces O
and O
helicopters N
to O
Shindand O
. O

However O
General O
Barno O
insists O
the O
US O
presence N
poses N
no O
threat N
to O
Iran O
. O

‘’ O
We H
have O
a O
very O
small O
number N
of O
forces N
in O
Shindand O
with O
a O
few O
helicopters N
, O
’’ O
says O
Barno O
. O

Nevertheless O
this O
places N
Karzai O
in O
a O
difficult O
and O
sensitive O
situation N
because O
he O
has O
to O
maintain O
excellent O
relations N
with O
both O
the O
US O
and O
Iran O
. O

‘’ O
Afghanistan O
has O
had O
the O
benefit N
of O
cooperation N
from O
both O
the O
US O
and O
Iran O
. O

So O
far O
what O
they O
have O
done O
together O
has O
been O
good O
for O
us H
and O
that’s O
that O
’s H
how O
we H
would O
like O
to O
keep O
it O
’’ O
, O
says O
Karzai O
. O

Nobody O
can O
claim O
that O
the O
interference N
of O
Afghanistan’s O
Afghanistan O
’s H
neighbours H
is O
over O
, O
but O
the O
elections N
will O
do O
much O
to O
strengthen O
Karzai O
and O
deal O
more O
firmly O
with O
neighbours’ O
neighbours H
’ O
interference N
. O

In O
the O
post N
election N
scenario N
it O
is O
becoming O
abundantly O
clear N
that O
the O
Taliban O
do O
not O
have O
the O
support N
of O
the O
Afghan O
people N
nor O
the O
Afghan O
Pashtuns O
. O

In O
a O
highly O
significant O
move O
Afghan O
Pashtun O
tribes N
along O
the O
Pakistan O
border N
warned O
the O
Taliban O
in O
Quetta O
and O
Chaman O
that O
if O
they O
try O
and O
disrupt O
the O
elections N
, O
they O
would O
be O
resisted O
. O

Many O
Taliban O
living O
in O
Afghanistan O
voted O
for O
President H
Karzai O
. O

It O
is O
now O
abundantly O
clear N
that O
with O
the O
rapidly O
changing O
face N
of O
Afghanistan O
, O
the O
demise N
of O
key N
Northern O
Alliance O
figures N
and O
the O
fluid O
political O
situation N
in O
Afghanistan O
, O
Pakistan O
should O
reconsider O
its O
policy N
of O
giving O
unlimited O
sanctuary N
to O
Taliban O
extremists H
living O
on O
Pakistani O
soil N
. O

The O
debate N
that O
a O
handful N
of O
Texas O
multi-millionnaires O
close O
to O
the O
Bush H
family H
have O
cleverly O
manufactured O
over O
John H
Kerry's O
Kerry H
's H
war N
record N
is O
absurd O
in O
every O
way N
. O

The O
charges N
that O
they O
have O
put O
some O
vets H
up O
to O
making O
against O
Kerry H
are O
false O
and O
can O
be O
demonstrated O
by O
the O
historical O
record N
to O
be O
false O
. O

Most O
of O
those O
making O
the O
charges N
have O
even O
flip O
- O
flopped O
, O
contradicting O
themselves O
. O

Or O
they O
weren't O
were O
n't O
eyewitnesses H
and O
are O
just O
lying O
. O

But O
to O
address N
the O
substance N
of O
this O
Big O
Lie N
is O
to O
risk N
falling O
into O
its O
logic N
. O

The O
true O
absurdity N
of O
the O
entire O
situation N
is O
easily O
appreciated O
when O
we H
consider O
that O
George H
W. O
Bush H
never O
showed O
any O
bravery N
at O
all O
at O
any O
point N
in O
his O
life N
. O

He O
has O
never O
lived O
in O
a O
war N
zone N
. O

If O
some O
of O
John H
Kerry's O
Kerry H
's H
wounds N
were O
superficial O
, O
Bush H
received O
no O
wounds N
. O

( O
And O
, O
a O
piece N
of O
shrapnel N
in O
the O
forearm N
that O
caused O
only O
a O
minor O
wound N
would O
have O
killed O
had O
it O
hit O
an O
eye N
and O
gone O
into O
the O
brain N
; O
the O
shrapnel N
being O
in O
your H
body N
demonstrates O
you H
were O
in O
mortal O
danger N
and O
didn't O
did O
n't O
absent O
yourself H
from O
it O
. O

That O
is O
the O
logic N
of O
the O

Kerry H
saved O
a O
man's O
man H

life N

under O
fire N

Bush H
did O
no O
such O
thing N
. O

What O
was O
Bush H
doing O
with O
his O
youth H
? O

He O
was O
drinking O
. O

He O
was O
drinking O
like O
a O
fish A
, O
every O
night N
, O
into O
the O
wee O
hours N
. O

For O
decades N
. O

He O
gave O
no O
service N
to O
anyone O

nothing N

did O
not O
even O
slack O
off O
efficiently O
. O

The O
history N
of O
alcoholism N
and O
possibly O
other O
drug N
use O
is O
a O
key N
issue N
because O
it O
not O
only O
speaks O
to O
Bush's O
Bush H
's H
character A
as O
an O
addictive O
personality N
, O
but O
may O
tell O
us H
something O
about O
his O
erratic O
and O
alarming O
actions N
as O
president H
. O

His O
explosive O
temper N
probably O
provoked O
the O
disastrous O
siege N
of O
Fallujah O
last O
spring N
, O
killing O
600 O
Iraqis O
, O
most O
of O
them O
women H
and O
children H
, O
in O
revenge N
for O
the O
deaths N
of O
4 O
civilian O
mercenaries H
, O
one N
of O
them O
a O
South O
African O
. O

( O
Newsweek O
reported O
that O
Bush H
commanded O
his O
cabinet N
, O
" O
Let O
heads N
roll O
! O
" O
) O

That O
temper N
is O
only O
one N
problem N
. O

Bush H
has O
a O
sadistic O
streak N
. O

He O
clearly O
enjoyed O
, O
as O
governor H
, O
watching O
executions N
. O

His O
delight N
in O
killing O
people N
became O
a O
campaign N
issue N
in O
2000 O
when O
he O
seemed O
, O
in O
one N
debate N
, O
to O
enjoy O
the O
prospect N
of O
executing O
wrong O
- O
doers H
a O
little O
too O
much O
. O

He O
has O
clearly O
gone O
on O
enjoying O
killing O
people N
on O
a O
large O
scale N
in O
Iraq O
. O

Drug N
abuse N
can O
affect O
the O
ability N
of O
the O
person H
to O
feel O
deep O
emotions N
like O
empathy N
. O

Two O
decades N
of O
pickling O
his O
nervous O
system N
in O
various O
highly O
toxic O
substances N
have O
left O
Bush H
damaged O
goods N

Even O
for O
those O
who O
later O
abstain O

" O
visual O

spatial O
abilities N
, O

and O

are O
the O
slowest O
to O

" O

That O
he O
managed O
to O
get O
on O
the O
wagon N
( O
though O
with O
that O
pretzel N
incident N
, O
you H
wonder O
how O
firmly O
) O
is O
laudable O
. O

But O
he O
suffers O
the O
severe O
effects N
of O
the O
aftermath N
, O
and O
we H
are O
all O
suffering N
along O
with O
him O
now O
, O
since O
he O
is O
the O
most O
powerful O
man H
in O
the O
world N
. O

We H
all O
know O
by O
now O
that O
Bush H
did O
not O
even O
do O
his O
full O
service N
with O
the O
Texas O
Air O
National O

, O
absenting O
himself O
to O
work N
on O
the O
Alabama O
senate N
campaign N
of O
Winton O
" O

Blount O
. O

Whether O
he O
was O
actually O
AWOL O
during O
this O
stint N
is O
unclear O
. O

But O
it O
is O
clear N
that O
not O
only O
did O
Bush H
slack O
off O
on O
his O
National O

but O
he O
slacked O
off O

This O

have O
been O
questions N
about O
whether O
George H

Bush H
fulfilled O
his O
obligations N

the O
National O

as O
a O
young O

in O

Ms. O

: O

He O
would O
wear O
khaki O

some O
old O
jacket N

He O
was O
always O
ready O
to O
go O
out O
on O
the O
road N

On O
the O

you H
could O
hear O
his O

It O
was O

But O
he O
just O

GOODWYN O
: O
The O
candidate H
Mr. N
Bush H
was O
working O
for O
, O
Red H
Blount O
, O
had O
gotten O
rich O
in O
Alabama O
in O
the O
construction N
business N
. O

Prominent O
Southern O
Republicans O
were O
something O
of O
a O
rare O
breed O
in O
those O
days N
. O

Blount's O
Blount O
's H
support N
of O
the O
party N
led O
him O
to O
be O
appointed O
Richard H
Nixon's O
Nixon H
's H
postmaster O
general O
. O

In O
Washington O
, O
Blount O
became O
friends H
and O
tennis N
partners H
with O
Mr. N
Bush's O
Bush H
's H
father H
, O
then O
Congressman O
Bush H
. O

That O
was O
how O
26 O
- O
year N
- O
old O
Lieutenant O
Bush H
came O
to O
Montgomery O
, O
at O
his O
father's O
father H
's H
urging O
. O
. O
. O

It O
was O
Mr. N
Bush's O
Bush H
's H
job N
to O
organize O
the O
Republican O
county N
chairpersons H
in O
the O
67 O
Alabama O
counties N
. O

Back N
in O
1972 O
in O
the O
Deep O
South O
, O
many O
rural O
counties N
didn't O
did O
n't O
have O
much O
in O
the O
way N
of O
official O
Republican O
Party O
apparatus N
. O

But O
throughout O
Alabama O
, O
there O
were O
Republicans O
and O
Democrats O
who O
wanted O
to O
help O
Red H
Blount O
. O

It O
was O
the O
young O
Texan's O
Texan O
's H
job N
to O
find O
out O
what O
each O
county N
leader H
needed O
in O
the O
way N
of O
campaign N
supplies N
and O
get O
those O
supplies N
to O
them O
. O

Groom O
says O
this O
job N
helped O
Mr. N
Bush H
understand O
how O
even O
in O
a O
statewide O
Senate O
campaign N
, O
politics N
are O
local O
. O

Murph O
Archibald H
is O
Red H
Blount's O
Blount O
's H
nephew H
by O
marriage N
, O
and O
in O
1972 O
, O
he O
was O
coming O
off O
a O
15 O
- O
month N
tour N
in O
Vietnam O
in O
the O
infantry N
. O

Archibald H
says O
that O
in O
a O
campaign N
full O
of O
dedicated O
workers H
, O
Mr. N
Bush H
was O
not O
one N
of O
them O
. O

Mr. N
MURPH O
ARCHIBALD O
( O
Nephew H
of O
Red H
Blount O
) O
: O
Well O
, O
I H
was O
coming O
in O
early O
in O
the O
morning N
and O
leaving O
in O
mid-evenings O
. O

Ordinarily O
, O
George H
would O
come O
in O
around O
noon N
; O
he O
would O
ordinarily O
leave O
around O
5:30 O
or O
6:00 O
in O
the O
evening N
. O

GOODWYN O
: O
Archibald H
says O
that O
two O
months N
before O
the O
election N
, O
in O
September O
of O
'72 O
, O
Red H
Blount's O
Blount O
's H
campaign N
manager H
came O
to O
him O
and O
asked O
that O
he O
quietly O
take O
over O
Mr. N
Bush's O
Bush H
's H
job N
because O
the O
campaign N
materials N
were O
not O
getting O
out O
to O
the O
counties N
. O

Mr. N
ARCHIBALD O
: O
George H
certainly O
didn't O
did O
n't O
seem O
to O
have O
any O
concerns O
about O
my H
taking O
over O
this O
work N
with O
the O
campaign N
workers H
there O
. O

My H
overall O
impression N
was O
that O
he O
didn't O
did O
n't O
seem O
as O
interested O
in O
the O
campaign N
as O
the O
other O
people N
who O
were O
working O
at O
the O
state N
headquarters N
. O

GOODWYN O
: O
Murph O
Archibald H
says O
that O
at O
first O
, O
he O
didn't O
did O
n't O
know O
that O
Mr. N
Bush H
was O
serving O
in O
the O
Air O
National O
Guard O
. O

After O
he O
found O
out O
from O
somebody H
else O
, O
Archibald H
attempted O
to O
talk O
to O
Mr. N
Bush H
about O
it O
. O

The O
president H
was O
a O
lieutenant H
and O
Archibald H
had O
been O
a O
lieutenant H
, O
too O
; O
he O
figured O
they O
had O
something O
to O
talk O
about O
. O

Mr. N
ARCHIBALD O
: O
George H
didn't O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
interest N
at O
all O
in O
talking O
about O
the O
military O
. O

In O
fact N
, O
when O
I H
broached O
the O
subject O
with O
him O
, O
he O
simply O
changed O
the O
subject O
. O

He O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
unpleasant O
about O
it O
, O
but O
he O
just O
changed O
the O
subject O
and O
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
talk O
about O
it O
. O

GOODWYN O
: O
Far O
from O
Texas O
and O
Washington O
, O
DC O
, O
Mr. N
Bush H
enjoyed O
his O
freedom N
. O

He O
dated O
a O
beautiful O
young O
woman H
working O
on O
the O
campaign N
. O

He O
went O
out O
in O
the O
evenings N
and O
had O
a O
good O
time N
. O

In O
fact N
, O
he O
left O
the O
house N
he O
rented O
in O
such O
disrepair N
-- O
with O
damage N
to O
the O
walls N
and O
a O
chandelier N
destroyed O
-- O
that O
the O
Montgomery H
family H
who O
owned O
it O
still O
grumble O
about O
the O
unpaid O
repair N
bill N
. O

Archibald H
says O
Mr. N
Bush H
would O
come O
into O
the O
office N
and O
, O
in O
a O
friendly O
way N
, O
offer O
up O
stories N
about O
the O
drinking O
he'd O
he O
'd O
done O
the O
night N
before O
, O
kind N
of O
as O
a O
conversation N
starter H
. O

Mr. N
ARCHIBALD O
: O
People N
have O
different O
ways N
of O
starting O
the O
days N
in O
any O
office N
. O

They're O
They O
're O
going O
to O
talk O
about O
their O
kids H
, O
they're O
they O
're O
going O
to O
talk O
about O
football N
, O
they're O
they O
're O
going O
to O
talk O
about O
the O
weather N
. O

And O
this O
was O
simply O
his O
opening N
gambit N
; O
he O
would O
start O
talking O
about O
that O
he O
had O
been O
out O
late O
the O
night N
before O
drinking O
. O

GOODWYN O
: O
Archibald H
says O
the O
frequency N
with O
which O
Mr. N
Bush H
discussed O
the O
subject O
was O
off O
- O
putting O
to O
him O
. O

Mr. N
ARCHIBALD O
: O
I H
mean O
, O
at O
that O
time N
, O
I H
was O
28 O
; O
George H
would O
have O
been O
25 O
or O
26 O
. O

And O
I H
thought O
it O
was O
really O
unusual O
that O
someone H
in O
their O
mid-20s O
would O
initiate O
conversations N
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
context N
of O
something O
as O
serious O
as O
a O
US O
senatorial O
campaign N
, O
by O
talking O
about O
their O
drinking O
the O
night N
before O
. O

I H
thought O
it O
unusual O
and O
, O
frankly O
, O
inappropriate O
. O

GOODWYN O
: O
According O
to O
Archibald H
, O
Mr. N
Bush H
would O
also O
sometimes O
tell O
stories N
about O
his O
days N
at O
Yale O
in O
New O
Haven N
, O
and O
how O
whenever O
he O
got O
pulled O
over O
for O
erratic O
driving O
, O
he O
was O
let O
go O
after O
the O
officers H
discovered O
he O
was O
the O
grandson H
of O
a O
Connecticut O
US O
senator O
. O

Archibald H
, O
a O
middle O
- O
class N
Alabama O
boy H
-- O
who O
, O
by O
the O
way N
, O
is O
now O
a O
registered O
Democrat O
-- O
didn't O
did O
n't O
like O
that O
story N
. O

Mr. N
ARCHIBALD O
: O
He O
told O
us H
whenever O
he O
was O
stopped O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
law N
enforcement N
found O
out O
that O
he O
was O
the O
grandson H
of O
Prescott H
Bush H
, O
they O
would O
let O
him O
go O
. O

And O
he O
would O
always O
laugh O
about O
that O
. O
" O

Goodwyn O
dutifully O
notes N
that O
Baba H
Groom O
didn't O
did O
n't O
remember O
George H
telling O
drunk O
stories N
. O

But O
that O
means N
nothing N
, O
since O
they O
weren't O
were O
n't O
the O
sort N
of O
things N
guys H
like O
Bush H
told O
the O
" O
girls H
" O
. O

He O
was O
trying O
to O
buddy H
with O
Archibald H
and O
impress O
him O
. O

Again O
, O
decades N
of O
this O
sort N
of O
behavior N
do O
not O
leave O
a O
person H
untouched O
. O

Our H
world N
is O
in O
crisis N
and O
our H
Republic O
is O
in O
danger N
. O

It O
should O
not O
be O
left O
in O
the O
hands N
of O
a O
man H
who O
spent O
his O
life N
like O
this O
. O

When O
the O
cities N
are O
on O
fire N
with O
the O
burning O
flesh O
of O
men H

Just O
remember O
that O
death N
is O
not O
the O
end N

And O
you H
search N
in O
vain O
to O
find O
just O
one N
law N
abiding O
citizen H

Just O
remember O
that O
death N
is O
not O
the O

Afraid O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
time N
today N
to O
discuss O
these O
, O
but O
some O
stories N
need O
attention N
: O

From O
Wednesday's O
Wednesday O
's H
Mirror O
the O
headline N
, O
" O
Have O
200,000 O
AK47s O
Fallen O
Into O
the O
Hands N
of O
Iraq O
Terrorists H
? O
" O

( O
also O
see O
this O
thread N
on O
the O
RI O
discussion N
board N
) O
: O

Some O
200,000 O
guns N
the O
US O
sent O
to O
Iraqi O
security N
forces N
may O
have O
been O
smuggled O
to O
terrorists H
, O
it O
was O
feared O
yesterday N
. O

The O
99 O
- O
tonne N
cache N
of O
AK47s O
was O
to O
have O
been O
secretly O
flown O
out O
from O
a O
US O
base N
in O
Bosnia O
. O

But O
the O
four O
planeloads O
of O
arms N
have O
vanished O
. O

Orders N
for O
the O
deal O
to O
go O
ahead O
were O
given O
by O
the O
US O
Department O
of O
Defense O
. O

But O
the O
work N
was O
contracted O
out O
via O
a O
complex O
web N
of O
private O
arms N
traders H
. O

And O
the O
Moldovan O
airline N
used O
to O
transport N
the O
shipment N
was O
blasted O
by O
the O
UN O
in O
2003 O
for O
smuggling O
arms N
to O
Liberia O
, O
human O
rights N
group N
Amnesty O
has O
discovered O
. O

It O
follows O
a O
separate O
probe O
claiming O
that O
thousands N
of O
guns N
meant O
for O
Iraq's O
Iraq O
's H
police N
and O
army N
instead O
went O
to O
al O
- O

. O

Amnesty O
chief O
spokesman H
Mike H
Blakemore O
said O
: O
" O
It's O
It O
's H
unbelievable O
that O
no O
one N
can O
account O
for O
200,000 O
assault N
rifles N
. O

If O
these O
weapons N
have O
gone O
missing O
it's O
it O
's H
a O
terrifying O
prospect N
. O
" O

American O
defence N
chiefs O
hired O
a O
US O
firm O
to O
take O
the O
guns N
, O
from O
the O
90s N
Bosnian O
war N
, O
to O
Iraq O
. O

But O
air N
traffic N
controllers H
in O
Baghdad O
have O
no O
record N
of O
the O
flights N
, O
which O
supposedly O
took O
off O
between O
July O
2004 O
and O
July O
2005 O
. O

A H
coalition N
forces N
spokesman H
confirmed O
they O
had O
not O
received O
" O
any O
weapons N
from O

and O
added O
they O
were O
" O
not O
aware O
of O
any O
purchases N
for O
Iraq O
from O
Bosnia O
" O
. O

Nato O
and O
US O
officials O
have O
already O
voiced O
fears N
that O
Bosnian O
arms N
- O
sold O
by O
US O
, O
British O
and O
Swiss O
firms N

are O
being O
passed O
to O

A H
NATO O

said O
: O
" O
There's O
There O

no O
tracking O
mechanism N
to O
ensure O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
fall N
into O
the O
wrong O
hands N
. O

There O
are O
concerns O
that O
some O
may O
have O
been O
siphoned O
off O
. O
" O

This O
year N
a O
newspaper N
claimed O
two O
UK O
firms N
were O
involved O
in O
a O
deal O
in O
which O
thousands N
of O
guns N
for O
Iraqi O
forces N
were O
re-routed O
to O

The O
Moldovan O

, O
and O
yes O
, O
it's O
it O

one N
of O

It's O
It O

even O
from O
some O
of O
the O
Administration's O
Administration O

critics H
. O

But O
then O
, O
even O
to O
talk O
of O
an O
" O
administration N
" O
may O
be O
misdirection N
at O
this O
point N
, O
given O
how O
little O
representative O
government N
means N
in O
the O
United O

these O
days N

and O
how O
much O
of O

" O
has O
been O
privatized O
into O
a O

gangland N
of O

Like O
the O

in O

it's O

CRACKDOWN N
ON O
POLYGAMY N
GROUP N

Small O
polygamous O
groups N
have O
existed O
in O
the O
southwestern O
US O
under O
the O
watchful O
yet O
fairly O
benign O
eye N
of O
authorities H
ever O
since O
a O
sect N
known O
as O
the O
Fundamentalist O
Latter O
Day O
Saints O
( O
FLDS O
) O
separated O
itself O
from O
mainstream O
Mormonism O
in O
1890 O
. O

... O

Now O
, O

Warren H

been O
added O
to O
the O
FBI's O
FBI O

, O
are O
having O
on O
the O
most O
vulnerable O
within O
the O
sect N
, O
particularly O
children H
and O
women H
. O

When O
the O
FLDS O
under O
Mr. N
Jeffs O
( O
and O
his O
father H
before O
him O
) O
grew O
to O
some O
10,000 O
followers H
in O
several O
southwestern O
communities N
with O
estimated O
assets N
of O
$ O
110 O
million O
; O
when O
it O
became O
clear N
that O
government N
officials O
, O
school N
authorities H
, O
and O
police N
in O
those O
communities N
had O
become O
intertwined O
with O
the O
sect N
; O
when O
ex-members O
increasingly O
reported O
child H
and O
sexual O
abuse N
charges N
( O
mainly O
involving O
underage O
girls H
forced O
to O
marry O
older O
men H
) O
; O
and O
when O
the O
sect N
began O
to O
use O
secluded O
compounds N
, O
state N
and O
federal O
authorities H
started O
to O
crack O
down O
more O
vigorously O
. O

... O

Specifically O
, O
Jeffs O
is O
charged O
in O
Utah O
and O
Arizona O
with O
sexual O
assault N
of O
underage O
girls H
and O
with O
arranging O
" O
spiritual O
" O

At O

, O
FBI O

" O

The O
Raw O
Story O

i H
count O
like O
14 O
explosive O
headlines N
. O

Then O
, O
of O
course N
, O
there O
is O
the O
evidence N
the O
jury N
did O
not O
hear O
about O
in O
the O
Robinson H
case N
... O

Funny O
how O
some O
things N
are O
squirelled O
away O
by O
well O
- O
meaning N
prosecutors H
... O

Maybe O
because O
they O
hint O
at O
a O
larger O
conspiracy N
/ O
network N
of O
abusers H
/ O
satanic O
underground O
? O

I H
read O
of O
a O
case N
not O
long O
ago O
when O
some O
people N
were O
trying O
to O
get O
a O
polygamous O
judge H
taken O
off O
the O
bench N
for O
not O
obeying O
state N
law N
. O

Of O
course N
law N
enforcement N
has O
dragged O
it's O
feet N
when O
members H
are O
taking O
part N
in O
the O
activity N
themselves O
. O

Personally O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
give O
a O
damn O
what O
adults H
do O
to O
one N
another O
as O
long O
as O
there O
is O
no O
abuse N
invovled O
. O

It O
is O
the O
marrying O
off O
of O
young O
girls H
to O
older O
men H
often O
close O
relatives A
that O
enfurates O
me H
. O

Also O
these O
cults N
have O
multimillions O
yet O
the O
women H
and O
kids H
live O
in O
poverty N
so O
the O
leaders H
can O
live O
the O
high O
life N
. O

In O
the O
Warren H
Jeffs O
cult N
he O
reassigns O
wives H
if O
the O
husband H
displeases O
him O
or O
to O
reward O
the O
new O
husband H
. O

Husbands H
marry O
mothers H
and O
teen H
daughters H
at O
the O
same O
time N
. O

a O
rare O
form N
of O
retardation N
is O
showing O
up O
in O
that O
group N
more O
than O
anywhere O
else O
in O
the O
world N
. O

It O
is O
genetic O
and O
the O
child H
needs N
to O
get O
the O
gene N
from O
both O
parents H
to O
turn O
into O
a O
vegetable N
instead O
of O
a O
thinking O
child H
. O

The O
doctor H
begs O
them O
to O
stop N
intermarrying O
but O
they O
say O
they O
have O
to O
keep O
the O
blood N
pure O
. O

look O
up O
fumarase O
deficiency N
for O
more O
info N
. O

Also O
look O
up O
the O
kingston O
family H
. O

One O
member N
actually O
was O
convicted O
of O
beating N
his O
teen H
daughter H
unconcious O
when O
she O
ran O
away O
from O
' O
marriage N
' O
to O
her O
father's O
father H
's H
own O
brother H
. O

no O
one N
was O
charged O
for O
forced O
marriage N
, O
only O
the O
beating N
. O

So O
we H
" O
lost O
" O
some O
weapon N
? O

It's O
It O
's H
a O
good O
thing N
too O
. O

We H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
want O
those O
terrorists H
to O
run O
out O
of O
shit O
to O
shoot N
at O
us H
. O

Then O
the O
war N
might O
stop N
& O
all O
those O
juicy O
profits N
would O
just O
evaporate O

What's O
What O

As O
the O

the O

a O

'' O
We H
have O
three O

Most O
of O
the O

I H
was O
meeting N

grown O
up O
in O
Mujahedeen O
schools N
in O
Ashraf O

they O
lived O
separated O
from O
their O
parents H

Family O
visits N
were O
allowed O
on O
Thursday O
nights N

Fridays O

When O
Iraq O
invaded O
Kuwait O
, O
many O
of O
these O

were O
transported O
to O

then O
smuggled O
to O

where O
they O
were O

were O
usually O
Mujahedeen O
supporters H

When O
they O
were O
18 O
or O
19 O
, O
many O
of O
them O
decided O
to O
come O
back O
to O
Iraq O
and O
fill O
the O
ranks O
of O
the O
youngest O
Mujahedeen O
generation N
. O

Though O
'' O
decided O
'' O
is O
probably O
not O
the O
right O
word N
, O
since O
from O
the O
day N
they O
were O
born O
, O
these O

were O
not O

to O
blindly O
follow O
their O

So O
... O
put O
some O
information N
in O
there O
. O

You H
know O
, O
nature N
hates O
a O
void O
. O
:) O

Richard H
, O

i H
agree O
, O
Hmmmmmm O
. O

How O
are O
chants N
of O
death N
and O
suicide N
... O
morality N
. O

What O
about O
Manson's O
Manson H
's H
tees N
bearing O
the O
message N
, O
" O
Kill O
your H
parents H
" O
. O

And O
were O
the O
Columbine O
killers H
acting N
out O
this O
" O
real O
morality N
" O
when O
they O
indescriminately O
murdered O
their O
classmates H
. O

They O
were O
death N
metal O
brainwashed O
fans H
, O
literally O
fulfilling O
the O
death N
metal O
paradigm N
, O
er O
... O
morality N
. O

( O
not O
church N
morality N
, O
no O
that O
is O
phoney O
, O
love O
thy H
neighbor H
... O
hell N
no O
, O
kill O
thy H
neighbor H
- O
now O
that O
is O
REAL O
MORALITY N
????? O
) O

So O
, O
hmmmm O
indeed O
. O

I H
detect O
the O
hissing N
lisp N
of O
the O
lying O
serpent A
in O
this O
article N
. O

The O
deathly O
inversion N
of O
truth N
, O
ala O
satanism O
. O

I H
think O
the O
jury's O
jury N
's H
still O
out O
on O
exactly O
who O
did O
the O
brainwashing N
when O
in O
regard N
to O
the O
Columbine O
killers H
. O

Perhaps O
we H
should O
look O
at O
the O
death N
metal O
phenomenon N
less O
as O
an O
invitation N
to O
violence N
than O
as O
a O
couter-cultural O
response N
to O
the O
over O
hypocrisy N
of O
a O
large O
percentage N
of O
the O
' O
Church N
- O
Morality N
' O
crowd N
, O
which O
gives O
a O
lot N
of O
lip N
service N
to O
loving O
thy H
neighbor H
, O
but O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
apply O
that O
love O
very O
far O
beyond O
their O
own O
congregation N
. O

The O
last O
I H
checked O
, O
the O
Satanists O
have O
a O
long O
way N
to O
go O
to O
catch O
up O
with O
the O
death N
and O
destruction N
dealt O
out O
by O
self O
- O
proclaimed O
( O
though O
false O
) O
Christians H
. O

Irony N
is O
dead O
... O
Long O
live O
Irony N
! O

That's O
That O
's H
it O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
firing O
my H
editor H
. O

Well O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
as O
simple O
and O
clear N
cut O
as O
all O
that O
. O

We're O
We H
're O
entering O
into O
some O
interesting O
and O
perhaps O
previously O
unexplored O
socio-political O
- O
spiritual O
territory N
here O
that O
may O
require O
further O
examination N
and O
serious O
introspection N
. O

The O
Kevin H
Coogan O
publication N
posted O
on O
the O
previous O
thread N
might O
serve O
as O
a O
good O
launching N
point N
for O
further O
discussion N
. O

The O
following O
quote N
is O
from O
that O
Coogan O
article N
: O

Imaginary O
evil O

romantic O

; O
real O
evil O

Simone H
Weil O

Starroute O
: O

I H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
wonder O
too O
hard O
. O

The O
answer N
is O
likely O
D H
: O
all O
of O
the O
above O
, O
due O
to O
this O
being O
a O
complex O
reality N
we H
live O
in O
. O

But O
to O
me H
, O
without O
question N
, O
they O
often O
know O
perfectly O
well O
. O

Here O
is O
a O
thought O
: O
When O
the O
appartently O
cognitively O
functional O
take O
actions N
that O
seem O
senseless O
and O
incompetent O
, O
it O
is O
a O
most O
certain O
sign N
that O
they O
have O
ulterior O
or O
hidden O
motives N
. O

They O
trust N
you H
and O
me H
to O
be O
befuddled O
by O
their O
actions N
, O
while O
they O
" O
do O
as O
they O
wilt O
" O

here O
I H
am O
thinking O
that O
I H
really O
must O
be O
getting O
old O

Since O
the O
article N
was O
specifically O
about O
" O
death N
metal O
" O
I H
guess O
the O
author H
missed O
this O
little O
tidbit N
or O
we H
just O
have O
waaaaaaaaaaaaay O
different O
definitions N
of O

One O
man's O
man H
's H
relentless O
search N
for O
his O
missing O
son H
led O
him O
to O
uncover O
one N
of O
the O
most O
shocking O
crimes N
in O
post-war O
Italy O
- O
a O
tale N
of O
satanism O
and O
violence N
that O
has O
gripped O
the O
country N
for O
more O
than O
a O
year N
. O

In O
January O
1998 O
Fabio O
Tollis O
and O
Chiara O
Marino H
, O
both O
just O
16 O
, O
disappeared O
. O

They O
had O
been O
drinking O
at O
a O
pub N
called O
the O
Midnight O
- O
the O
centre N
of O
the O
heavy O
metal O
scene N
in O
Milan O
- O
and O
they O
never O
came O
home N
. O

The O
police N
and O
many O
of O
their O
friends H
just O
thought O
they O
had O
run O
off O
together O
. O

But O
their O
parents H
refused O
to O
accept O
this O
. O

Michele H
Tollis O
, O
Fabio's O
Fabio O
's H
father H
, O
began O
to O
attend O
metal O
concerts N
and O
festivals N
across O
Europe O
, O
handing O
out O
leaflets N
and O
quizzing O
Fabio's O
Fabio O
's H
friends H
. O

Fabio O
and O
his O
friends H
were O
into O
the O
most O
extreme O
forms N
of O
heavy O
metal O
music N
- O
death N
metal O
and O
black O
metal O
, O
music N
obsessed O
with O
images N
of O
murder O
and O
satanism O
- O
and O
the O
role N
of O
this O
music N
is O
central O
to O
the O
story N
. O

No O
one N
can O
contradict O
me H
when O
I H
say O
that O
heavy O
metal O
and O
satanism O
are O
closely O
linked O

Michele H
Tollis O

It O
emerged O
that O
Chiara O
, O
the O
girl H
who O
disappeared O
with O
Fabio O
, O
had O
a O
collection N
of O
satanic O
literature N
and O
paraphernalia N
in O
her O
bedroom N
. O

During O
this O
search N
, O
Michele H
Tollis O
became O
convinced O
that O
satanism O
had O
something O
to O
do O
with O
his O
son's O
son H
's H
disappearance N
. O

" O
No O
one N
can O
contradict O
me H
when O
I H
say O
that O
heavy O
metal O
and O
satanism O
are O
closely O
linked O
. O

They're O
They O
're O
inseparable O
, O
" O
he O
says O
. O

Yeah O
, O
I H
think O
Jeff H
wrote O
on O
one N
of O
his O
posts N
here O
in O
the O
past N
several O
months N
: O
" O
To O
hell N
with O
death N
" O
. O

I H
wholly O
agree O
, O
and O
would O
expand O
that O
statement N
to O
include O
: O
" O
To O
hell N
with O
death N
metal O
" O
. O

The O
freaky O
thing N
here O
is O
that O
these O
bozos H
are O
seriously O
claiming O
the O
moral O
high O
ground N
? O
? O
? O
? O
? O

Talk O
about O
a O
beat O
- O
your H
- O
head N
- O
against O
- O
the O
- O
wall N
moment N
! O

And O
for O
' O
Smartwolf O
' O
above O
, O
think O
about O
the O
inversion N
principle N
being O
employed O
. O

They O
are O
doing O
it O
deliberately O
. O

Do O
you H
really O
think O
GWB O
, O
and O
neocons H
in O
general O
are O
representative O
of O
true O
followers H
of O
Jesus H
of O
Nazareth O
? O

( O
I H
know O
, O
ignorant O
question N
) O
Then O
why O
call O
them O
, O
or O
any O
other O
phonies H
' O
Christians H
' O
, O
even O
if O
they O
themselves O
claim O
the O
appellation N
. O

They O
are O
merely O
imposters H
. O

Everything O
they O
claim O
is O
a O
lie O
, O
and O
this O
above O
all O
. O

So O
why O
even O
credit N
their O
claims N
? O

This O
only O
serves O
their O
purposes N
. O

They O
want O
to O
be O
identified O
as O
' O
Christians H
' O
, O
and O
I H
fully O
suspect O
that O
for O
some O
of O
them O
, O
the O
motivation N
behind O
their O
subterfuge N
is O
more O
than O
mere O
political O
advantage N
, O
and O
has O
a O
lot N
more O
to O
do O
with O
the O
black O
magician's O
magician H
's H
practice O
of O
the O
inversion N
principle N
. O

We H
need O
to O
be O
more O
' O
rigorous O
' O
about O
how O
we H
perceive O
these O
people N
. O

See O
them O
as O
they O
are O
, O
not O
for O
what O
they O
claim O
to O
be O
. O

the O

: O

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_art O

Ironically O
( O
or O
perhaps O
not O
) O
, O
the O
notion N
of O
the O
' O
degenerate O
' O
and O
' O
degenerate O
art N
' O
was O
appropriated O
by O
the O
Nazis H
and O
its O
origins N
can O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
Jewish O
' O
intellectual O
' O
Max H
Nordau O
and O
a O
1892 O
book O
he O
authored O
called O
Degeneration O
. O
. O

Nordau O
was O
also O
the O
co O
founder H
of O
the O
World N

Organization N

When O
the O
apparently O
cognitively O
functional O
take O
actions N

seem O
senseless O

it O
is O
a O

A H
question N
: O

Are O
the O
adherent H
of O
' O
Crowleyan O
Thelema O
' O
and O
others O
of O
similar O
ilk N
appropriating O
or O
appropriating O
from O
the O
appropriators H
to O
redirect O
' O
energy N
? O
' O

Does O
this O
reappropriation O
lead O
to O
or O
originate O
from O
the O
same O
place N
? O

Seems O
as O
if O
there O
is O
a O
clear N
distinction N
being O
made O
between O
the O
' O
imaginary O
' O
Whore O
of O
Babalon O
and O
the O
actually O
Whore O
of O
Babylon O
, O
which O
is O
this O
global O
system N
. O

Is O
the O
distinction N
accurate O
and O
valid O
? O

Does O
the O
distinction N
actually O
exist O
? O

This O
is O
where O
the O
socio O
- O
political O
aspect N
of O
this O
conundrum N
comes O
into O
play O
. O

Confused O
? O

Good O
. O

so O
, O
enemy N

what's O
what O
's H
your H
point N
? O

Why O
don't O
do O
n't O
you H
state N
it O
? O

My H
point N
is O
that O
these O
are O
all O
just O
questions N

I H
am O
undecided O
as O
to O
the O
answers N

Here's O

another O

I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
believe O
there O
are O
no O
serious O

who O
frequent O

I'm O
I H
'm O
wary O
of O
jumping O
into O
this O
fray N
without O
backup H
, O
that's O
that O
's H
for O
damn O
sure O

I'm O

Simply O
, O
the O
questions N
permeate O
the O
entire O
' O
Western O
( O
Mystery N
) O
Tradition N
' O
and O
perhaps O
' O
Eastern O
' O
as O
well O
, O
as O
they O
relate O
to O
the O
confluence N
of O
politics N
and O
spirituality N
. O

For O
example N
, O
is O
the O
system N
of O
Crowleyan O
Thelema O
a O
failed O
alchemical O
process N
? O

Or O
was O
it O
supposed O
to O
initially O
be O
a O
process N
of O
alchemical O
appropriation N
? O

Similarly O
, O
is O
invoking O
ancient O
Egyptian O
gods A
and O
goddesses A
a O
reaffirmation N
of O
an O
oppressive O
and O
hierarchical O
system N
? O

In O
my H
opinion N
, O
people N
can O
no O
longer O
afford O
to O
partition O
out O
and O
compartmentalize O
personal O
spiritual O
and O
political O
systems N
. O

The O
' O
high O
weirdness N
' O
and O
more O
hardcore O
political O
' O
factions N
' O
must O
perhaps O
integrate O
and O
arrive O
at O
a O
synthesis N
. O

In O
regards O
to O
death N
metal O
, O
the O
problem N
is O
, O
once O
again O
, O
a O
question N
of O
education N
, O
history N
and O
the O
vacuous O
lack N
of O
perspective N
in O
American O
culture N
. O

Shall O
we H
censor O
the O
works O
of O
poet H
Charles H
Baudelaire O
as O
well O
? O

Baudelaire O
was O
perhaps O
one N
of O
the O
first O
' O
death N
metal O
' O
artists H
. O

Tronicus O
, O
if O
you're O
you H
're O
still O
checking O
this O
thread N
: O

A H
bit N
of O
a O
knee N
- O
jerk N
reaction N
from O
me H
there O
, O
and O
I H
apologize O
for O
my H
over-generalizations O
. O

My H
real O
problem N
is O
with O
literalist O
fundamentalists H
, O
of O
any O
religion N
. O

True O
believers H
are O
dangerous O
animals A
. O

I H
just O
get O
hung O
up O
on O
' O
Christians H
' O
, O
as O
they're O
they O
're O
the O
dominant O
form N
where O
I H
come O
from O
. O

Also O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
quite O
clear N
on O
the O
fact N
that O
those O
in O
power N
now O
( O
and O
, O
in O
general O
, O
most O
anyone O
at O
the O
top N
of O
a O
pyrimidal O
power N
structure N
) O
tend O
to O
use O
the O
dominant O
religion N
as O
a O
cloak N
to O
hide N
their O
true O
motivations N
and O
as O
a O
tool N
to O
control N
the O
masses N
. O

It O
boggles O
the O
mind N
that O
ANYONE O
can O
take O
at O
face N
value N
Bush's O
Bush H
's H
claims N
to O
be O
a O
christian O
, O
yet O
many O
seem O
to O
do O
just O
that O
. O

I H
seem O
to O
remember O
something O
about O
' O
by O
their O
works O
shall O
ye H
know O
them O
. O
" O

I H
do O
get O
my H
hackles N
up O
a O
bit N
when O
people N
haul O
out O
the O
old O
' O
Rock O
- O
N O
- O
Roll O
made O
them O
do O
it O
' O
argument N
. O

Whie O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
subscribe O
to O
the O
notion N
that O
the O
things N
we H
watch O
or O
listen O
to O
have O
no O
effect N
on O
our H
behavior N
( O
which O
I H
think O
is O
patently O
rediculous O
) O
, O
it O
does O
bother O
me H
when O
people N
single O
out O
a O
specific O
group N
of O
people N
to O
pin N
the O
blame N
on O
. O

Sub-cultures O
( O
as O
the O
lable O
implies O
) O
do O
not O
develope O
in O
a O
vacuum N
. O

Again O
, O
I H
think O
the O
problem N
is O
people N
who O
sink N
to O
far O
into O
their O
own O
egos N
, O
and O
begin O
to O
take O
their O
personal O
metaphors N
a O
bit N
too O
literaly O
. O

These O
people N
are O
dangerous O
wether O
they're O
they O
're O
head N
- O
banging O
to O
' O
Canibal O
Corpse O
' O
or O
humming O
along O
to O
' O
Onward O
Christian O
Soldiers H
' O
. O

( O
The O
mixing O
of O
religion N
and O
militarism N
is O
a O
whole O
other O
topic N
.... O
) O

I H
have O
nothing N
but O
respect N
for O
people N
who O
adhear O
to O
non-violence O
, O
forgiveness N
, O
and O
charity N
, O
but O
it's O
it O
's H
important O
to O
remember O
that O
Christians H
( O
or O
' O
Smartwolves O
' O
) O
do O
not O
have O
a O
monopoly N
on O
that O
particular O
lifestyle N
. O

Peace N
. O

The O
fact N
that O
the O
US O
government N
and O
media N
are O
having O
a O
hissy O
fit O
over O
Venezuela O
wanting O
to O
buy O
guns N
, O
and O
then O
200,000 O
of O
the O
guns N
Chavez O
wants O
to O
buy O
go O
missing O
on O
their O
way N
to O
Iraq O
is O
definitely O
sus O
. O

I H
guess O
those O
guns N
will O
be O
located O
enroute O
to O
Venezuela O
or O
found O
in O
storage N
there O
by O
one N
of O
the O
US's O
US O
's H
local O
stooges H
and O
they O
then O
have O
a O
pretext N
to O
ramp O
the O
spin N
up O
a O
notch N
or O
two O
. O

Thanks N
again O
to O
my H
friend H
Nick H
Keck O
for O
passing O
this O
along O
via O
e-mail N
. O

It O
is O

given O
by O
an O
Arab O
gentleman H
before O
the O
advisory O
board N
of O

It's O
It O

a O
long O

very O
worthwhile O

Talk O
delivered O
by O
Haim O
Harari O
at O
a O
meeting N
of O
the O
International O
Advisory O
Board O
of O
a O
large O
multi-national O
corporation N
, O
April O
, O
2004 O
: O

" O
As O
you H
know O
, O
I H
usually O
provide O
the O
scientific O
and O
technological O
" O
entertainment N
" O
in O
our H
meetings N
, O
but O
, O
on O
this O
occasion N
, O
our H
Chairman O
suggested O
that O
I H
present N
my H
own O
personal O
view N
on O
events N
in O
the O
part N
of O
the O
world N
from O
which O
I H
come O
. O

I H
have O
never O
been O
and O
I H
will O
never O
be O
a O
Government O
official O
and O
I H
have O
no O
privileged O
information N
. O

My H
perspective N
is O
entirely O
based O
on O
what O
I H
see O
, O
on O
what O
I H
read O
and O
on O
the O
fact N
that O
my H
family H
has O
lived O
in O
this O
region N
for O
almost O
200 O
years N
. O

You H
may O
regard N
my H
views N
as O
those O
of O
the O
proverbial O
taxi N
driver H
, O
which O
you H
are O
supposed O
to O
question N
, O
when O
you H
visit O
a O
country N
. O

I H
could O
have O
shared O
with O
you H
some O
fascinating O
facts N
and O
some O
personal O
thoughts N
about O
the O
Israeli O
- O
Arab O
conflict N
. O

However O
, O
I H
will O
touch O
upon O
it O
only O
in O
passing O
. O

I H
prefer O
to O
devote O
most O
of O
my H
remarks N
to O
the O
broader O
picture N
of O
the O
region N
and O
its O
place N
in O
world N
events N
. O

I H
refer O
to O
the O
entire O
area N
between O
Pakistan O
and O
Morocco O
, O
which O
is O
predominantly O
Arab O
, O
predominantly O
Moslem O
, O
but O
includes O
many O
non-Arab O
and O
also O
significant O
non-Moslem O
minorities N
. O

Why O
do O
I H
put O
aside O
Israel O
and O
its O
own O
immediate O
neighborhood N
? O

Because O
Israel O
and O
any O
problems N
related O
to O
it O
, O
in O
spite N
of O
what O
you H
might O
read O
or O
hear O
in O
the O
world N
media N
, O
is O
not O
the O
central O
issue N
, O
and O
has O
never O
been O
the O
central O
issue N
in O
the O
upheaval N
in O
the O
region N
. O

Yes O
, O
there O
is O
a O
100 O
year N
- O
old O
Israeli O
- O
Arab O
conflict N
, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
where O
the O
main O
show O
is O
. O

The O
millions N
who O
died O
in O
the O
Iran O
- O
Iraq O
war N
had O
nothing N
to O
do O
with O
Israel O
. O

The O
mass O
murder O
happening O
right O
now O
in O
Sudan O
, O
where O
the O
Arab O
Moslem O
regime N
is O
massacring O
its O
black O
Christian O
citizens H
, O
has O
nothing N
to O
do O
with O
Israel O
. O

The O
frequent O
reports N
from O
Algeria O
about O
the O
murders O
of O
hundreds N
of O
civilians H
in O
one N
village N
or O
another O
by O
other O
Algerians O
have O
nothing N
to O
do O
with O
Israel O
. O

Saddam H
Hussein H
did O
not O
invade O
Kuwait O
, O
endanger O
Saudi O
Arabia O
and O
butcher O
his O
own O
people N
because O
of O
Israel O
. O

Egypt O
did O
not O
use O
poison N
gas N
against O
Yemen O
in O
the O
60's N
because O
of O
Israel O
. O

Assad O
the O
Father H
did O
not O
kill O
tens N
of O
thousands N
of O
his O
own O
citizens H
in O
one N
week N
in O
El O
Hamma O
in O
Syria O
because O
of O
Israel O
. O

The O
Taliban O
control N
of O
Afghanistan O
and O
the O
civil O
war N
there O
had O
nothing N
to O
do O
with O
Israel O
. O

The O
Libyan O
blowing O
up O
of O
the O
Pan A
- O
Am O
flight N
had O
nothing N
to O
do O
with O
Israel O
, O
and O
I H
could O
go O
on O
and O
on O
and O
on O
. O

The O
root N
of O
the O
trouble N
is O
that O
this O
entire O
Moslem O
region N
is O
totally O
dysfunctional O
, O
by O
any O
standard O
of O
the O
word N
, O
and O
would O
have O
been O
so O
even O
if O
Israel O
had O
joined O
the O
Arab O
league N
and O
an O
independent O
Palestine O
had O
existed O
for O
100 O
years N
. O

The O
22 O
member N
countries N
of O
the O
Arab O
league N
, O
from O
Mauritania O
to O
the O
Gulf O
States O
, O
have O
a O
total N
population N
of O
300 O
millions N
, O
larger O
than O
the O
US O
and O
almost O
as O
large O
as O
the O
EU O
before O
its O
expansion N
. O

They O
have O
a O
land O
area N
larger O
than O
either O
the O
US O
or O
all O
of O
Europe O
. O

These O
22 O
countries N
, O
with O
all O
their O
oil N
and O
natural O
resources N
, O
have O
a O
combined O
GDP O
smaller O
than O
that O
of O
Netherlands O
plus O
Belgium O
and O
equal O
to O
half O
of O
the O
GDP O
of O
California O
alone O
. O

Within O
this O
meager O
GDP O
, O
the O
gaps N
between O
rich O
and O
poor O
are O
beyond O
belief N
and O
too O
many O
of O
the O
rich O
made O
their O
money N
not O
by O
succeeding O
in O
business N
, O
but O
by O
being O
corrupt O
rulers H
. O

The O
social O
status N
of O
women H
is O
far O
below O
what O
it O
was O
in O
the O
Western O
World N
150 O
years N
ago O
. O

Human A
rights N
are O
below O
any O
reasonable O
standard O
, O
in O
spite N
of O
the O
grotesque O
fact N
that O
Libya O
was O
elected O
Chair O
of O
the O
UN O
Human A
Rights N
commission N
. O

According O
to O
a O
report N
prepared O
by O
a O
committee N
of O
Arab O
intellectuals H
and O
published O
under O
the O
auspices N
of O
the O
U.N. O
, O
the O
number N
of O
books N
translated O
by O
the O
entire O
Arab O
world N
is O
much O
smaller O
than O
what O
little O
Greece O
alone O
translates O
. O

The O
total N
number N
of O
scientific O
publications N
of O
300 O
million O
Arabs O
is O
less O
than O
that O
of O
6 O
million O
Israelis O
. O

Birth N
rates N
in O
the O
region N
are O
very O
high O
, O
increasing O
the O
poverty N
, O
the O
social O
gaps N
and O
the O
cultural O
decline N
. O

And O
all O
of O
this O
is O
happening O
in O
a O
region N
, O
which O
only O
30 O
years N
ago O
, O
was O
believed O
to O
be O
the O
next O
wealthy O
part N
of O
the O
world N
, O
and O
in O
a O
Moslem O
area N
, O
which O
developed O
, O
at O
some O
point N
in O
history N
, O
one N
of O
the O
most O
advanced O
cultures N
in O
the O
world N
. O

It O
is O
fair O
to O
say O
that O
this O
creates O
an O
unprecedented O
breeding O
ground N
for O
cruel O
dictators H
, O
terror N
networks N
, O
fanaticism N
, O
incitement N
, O
suicide N
murders O
and O
general O
decline N
. O

It O
is O
also O
a O
fact N
that O
almost O
everybody O
in O
the O
region N
blames O
this O
situation N
on O
the O
United O
States O
, O
on O
Israel O
, O
on O
Western O
Civilization N
, O
on O
Judaism O
and O
Christianity O
, O
on O
anyone O
and O
anything O
, O
except O
themselves O
. O

A H
word N
about O
the O
millions N
of O
decent O
, O
honest O
, O
good O
people N
who O
are O
either O
devout O
Moslems O
or O
are O
not O
very O
religious O
but O
grew O
up O
in O
Moslem O
families N
: O
They O
are O
double O
victims H
of O
an O
outside O
world N
, O
which O
now O
develops O
Islamophobia N
, O
and O
of O
their O
own O
environment N
which O
breaks O
their O
heart N
by O
being O
totally O
dysfunctional O
. O

The O
problem N
is O
that O
the O
vast O
silent O
majority N
of O
these O
Moslems O
are O
not O
part N
of O
the O
terror N
and O
the O
incitement N
, O
but O
they O
also O
do O
not O
stand O
up O
against O
it O
. O

They O
become O
accomplices H
, O
by O
omission N
, O
and O
this O
applies O
to O
political O
leaders H
, O
intellectuals H
, O
business N
people N
and O
many O
others O
. O

Many O
of O
them O
can O
certainly O
tell O
right O
from O
wrong O
, O
but O
are O
afraid O
to O
express O
their O
views N
. O

The O
events N
of O
the O
last O
few O
years N
have O
amplified O
four O
issues N
, O
which O
have O
always O
existed O
, O
but O
have O
never O
been O
as O
rampant O
as O
in O
the O
present N
upheaval N
in O
the O
region N
. O

A H
few O
more O
years N
may O
pass O
before O
everybody O
acknowledges O
that O
it O
is O
a O
World N
War N
, O
but O
we H
are O
already O
well O
into O
it O
. O

These O
are O
the O
four O
main O
pillars N
of O
the O
current O
World N
Conflict O
, O
or O
perhaps O
we H
should O
already O
refer O
to O
it O
as O
" O
the O
undeclared O
World N
War N
III O
" O
: O

* O
1 O
. O
The O
first O
element N
is O
the O
suicide N
murder O
. O
* O

Suicide N
murders O
are O
not O
a O
new O
invention N
but O
they O
have O
been O
made O
popular O
, O
if O
I H
may O
use O
this O
expression N
, O
only O
lately O
. O

Even O
after O
September O
11 O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
most O
of O
the O
Western O
World N
does O
not O
yet O
understand O
this O
weapon N
. O

It O
is O
a O
very O
potent O
psychological O
weapon N
. O

Its O
real O
direct O
impact N
is O
relatively O
minor O
. O

The O
total N
number N
of O
casualties H
from O
hundreds N
of O
suicide N
murders O
within O
Israel O
in O
the O
last O
three O
years N
is O
much O
smaller O
than O
those O
due O
to O
car N
accidents N
. O

September O
11 O
was O
quantitatively O
much O
less O
lethal O
than O
many O
earthquakes N

More O
people N
die O
from O
AIDS O
in O
one N
day N
in O
Africa O
than O
all O
the O
Russians O
who O
died O
in O
the O
hands N
of O
Chechnya O
- O
based O
Moslem O
suicide N
murderers H
since O
that O
conflict N
started O
. O

Saddam H
killed O
every O
month N
more O
people N
than O
all O
those O
who O
died O
from O
suicide N
murders O
since O
the O
Coalition O
occupation N
of O
Iraq O
. O

So O
what O
is O
all O
the O
fuss N
about O
suicide N
killings N
? O

It O
creates O
headlines N
. O

It O
is O
spectacular O
. O

It O
is O
frightening O
. O

It O
is O
a O
very O
cruel O
death N
with O
bodies N
dismembered O
and O
horrible O
severe O
lifelong O
injuries N
to O
many O
of O
the O
wounded O
. O

It O
is O
always O
shown O
on O
television N
in O
great O
detail N
. O

One O
such O
murder O
, O
with O
the O
help O
of O
hysterical O
media N
coverage N
, O
can O
destroy O
the O
tourism N
industry N
of O
a O
country N
for O
quite O
a O
while O
, O
as O
it O
did O
in O
Bali O
and O
in O
Turkey O
. O

But O
the O
real O
fear N
comes O
from O
the O
undisputed O
fact N
that O
no O
defense N
and O
no O
preventive O
measures N
can O
succeed O
against O
a O
determined O
suicide N
murderer H
. O

This O
has O
not O
yet O
penetrated O
the O
thinking O
of O
the O
Western O
World N
. O

The O
U.S. O
and O
Europe O
are O
constantly O
improving O
their O
defense N
against O
the O
last O
murder O
, O
not O
the O
next O
one N
. O

We H
may O
arrange O
for O
the O
best O
airport N
security N
in O
the O
world N
. O

But O
if O
you H
want O
to O
murder O
by O
suicide N
, O
you H
do O
not O
have O
to O
board N
a O
plane N
in O
order O
to O
explode O
yourself H
and O
kill O
many O
people N
. O

Who O
could O
stop N
a O
suicide N
murder O
in O
the O
midst N
of O
the O
crowded O
line N
waiting O
to O
be O
checked O
by O
the O
airport N
metal O
detector N
? O

How O
about O
the O
lines N
to O
the O
check O
- O
in O
counters N
in O
a O
busy O
travel O
period N
? O

Put O
a O
metal O
detector N
in O
front N
of O
every O
train N
station N
in O
Spain O
and O
the O
terrorists H
will O
get O
the O
buses N
. O

Protect O
the O
buses N
and O
they O
will O
explode O
in O
movie N
theaters N
, O
concert N
halls N
, O
supermarkets N
, O
shopping O
malls N
, O
schools N
and O
hospitals N
. O

Put O
guards H
in O
front N
of O
every O
concert N
hall N
and O
there O
will O
always O
be O
a O
line N
of O
people N
to O
be O
checked O
by O
the O
guards H
and O
this O
line N
will O
be O
the O
target N
, O
not O
to O
speak O
of O
killing O
the O
guards H
themselves O
. O

You H
can O
somewhat O
reduce O
your H
vulnerability N
by O
preventive O
and O
defensive O
measures N
and O
by O
strict O
border N
controls N
but O
not O
eliminate O
it O
and O
definitely O
not O
win O
the O
war N
in O
a O
defensive O
way N
. O

And O
it O
is O
a O
war N
! O

What O
is O
behind O
the O
suicide N
murders O
? O

Money N
is O
, O
money N
and O
power N
and O
cold O
- O
blooded O
murderous O
incitement N
, O
nothing N
else O
. O

It O
has O
nothing N
to O
do O
with O
true O
fanatic O
religious O
beliefs N
. O

No O
Moslem O
preacher H
has O
ever O
blown O
himself O
up O
. O

No O
son H
of O
an O
Arab O
politician H
or O
religious O
leader H
has O
ever O
blown O
himself O
up O
. O

No O
relative O
of O
anyone O
influential O
has O
done O
it O
. O

Wouldn't O
Would O
n't O
you H
expect O
some O
of O
the O
religious O
leaders H
to O
do O
it O
themselves O
, O
or O
to O
talk O
their O
sons H
into O
doing O
it O
, O
if O
this O
is O
truly O
a O
supreme O
act N
of O
religious O
fervor N
? O

Aren't O
Are O
n't O
they O
interested O
in O
the O
benefits N
of O
going O
to O
Heaven O
? O

Instead O
, O
they O
send O
outcast O
women H
, O
naive O
children H
, O
retarded O
people N
and O
young O
incited O
hotheads H
. O

They O
promise N
them O
the O
delights N
, O
mostly O
sexual O
, O
of O
the O
next O
world N
, O
and O
pay O
their O
families N
handsomely O
after O
the O
supreme O
act N
is O
performed O
and O
enough O
innocent O
people N
are O
dead O
. O

Suicide N
murders O
also O
have O
nothing N
to O
do O
with O
poverty N
and O
despair N
. O

The O
poorest O
region N
in O
the O
world N
, O
by O
far O
, O
is O
Africa O
. O

It O
never O
happens O
there O
. O

There O
are O
numerous O
desperate O
people N
in O
the O
world N
, O
in O
different O
cultures N
, O
countries N
and O
continents N
. O

Desperation N
does O
not O
provide O
anyone O
with O
explosives N
, O
reconnaissance N
and O
transportation N
. O

There O
was O
certainly O
more O
despair N
in O
Saddam's O
Saddam H
's H
Iraq O
than O
in O
Paul H
Bremmer's O
Bremmer O
's H
Iraq O
, O
and O
no O
one N
exploded O
himself O
. O

A H
suicide N
murder O
is O
simply O
a O
horrible O
, O
vicious O
weapon N
of O
cruel O
, O
inhuman O
, O
cynical O
, O
well O
- O
funded O
terrorists H
, O
with O
no O
regard N
to O
human O
life N
, O
including O
the O
life N
of O
their O
fellow H
countrymen H
, O
but O
with O
very O
high O
regard N
to O
their O
own O
affluent O
well O
- O
being O
and O
their O
hunger N
for O
power N
. O

The O
only O
way N
to O
fight N
this O
new O
" O
popular O
" O
weapon N
is O
identical O
to O
the O
only O
way N
in O
which O
you H
fight N
organized O
crime N
or O
pirates H
on O
the O
high O
seas N
: O
the O
offensive O
way N
. O

Like O
in O
the O
case N
of O
organized O
crime N
, O
it O
is O
crucial O
that O
the O
forces N
on O
the O
offensive O
be O
united O
and O
it O
is O
crucial O
to O
reach O
the O
top N
of O
the O
crime N
pyramid N
. O

You H
cannot O
can O
not O
eliminate O
organized O
crime N
by O
arresting O
the O
little O
drug N
dealer H
on O
the O
street N
corner N
. O

You H
must O
go O
after O
the O
head N
of O
the O
" O
Family O
" O
. O

If O
part N
of O
the O
public O
supports O
it O
, O
others O
tolerate O
it O
, O
many O
are O
afraid O
of O
it O
and O
some O
try O
to O
explain O
it O
away O
by O
poverty N
or O
by O
a O
miserable O
childhood N
, O
organized O
crime N
will O
thrive O
and O
so O
will O
terrorism N
. O

The O
United O
States O
understands O
this O
now O
, O
after O
September O
11 O
. O

Russia O
is O
beginning O
to O
understand O
it O
. O

Turkey O
understands O
it O
well O
. O

I H
am O
very O
much O
afraid O
that O
most O
of O
Europe O
still O
does O
not O
understand O
it O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
Europe O
will O
understand O
it O
only O
after O
suicide N
murders O
arrive O
in O
Europe O
in O
a O
big O
way N
. O

In O
my H
humble O
opinion N
, O
this O
will O
definitely O
happen O
. O

The O
Spanish O
trains N
and O
the O
Istanbul O
bombings N
are O
only O
the O
beginning O
. O

The O
unity N
of O
the O
Civilized O
World N
in O
fighting O
this O
horror N
is O
absolutely O
indispensable O
. O

Until O
Europe O
wakes O
up O
, O
this O
unity N
will O
not O
be O
achieved O
. O

* O
2 O
. O
The O
second N
ingredient N
is O
words N
, O
more O
precisely O
lies N
. O
* O

Words O
can O
be O
lethal O
. O

They O
kill O
people N
. O

It O
is O
often O
said O
that O
politicians H
, O
diplomats H
and O
perhaps O
also O
lawyers H
and O
business N
people N
must O
sometimes O
lie O
, O
as O
part N
of O
their O
professional O
life N
. O

But O
the O
norms N
of O
politics N
and O
diplomacy N
are O
childish O
, O
in O
comparison N
with O
the O
level N
of O
incitement N
and O
total N
absolute O
deliberate O
fabrications N
, O
which O
have O
reached O
new O
heights O
in O
the O
region N
we H
are O
talking O
about O
. O

An O
incredible O
number N
of O
people N
in O
the O
Arab O
world N
believe O
that O
September O
11 O
never O
happened O
, O
or O
was O
an O
American O
provocation N
or O
, O
even O
better O
, O
a O
Jewish O
plot N
. O

You H
all O
remember O
the O
Iraqi O
Minister H
of O
Information O
, O
Mr. N
Mouhamad O
Said H
al O
- O
Sahaf O
and O
his O
press N
conferences N
when O
the O
US O
forces N
were O
already O
inside O
Baghdad O
. O

Disinformation N
at O
time N
of O
war N
is O
an O
accepted O
tactic N
. O

But O
to O
stand O
, O
day N
after O
day N
, O
and O
to O
make O
such O
preposterous O
statements N
, O
known O
to O
everybody O
to O
be O
lies N
, O
without O
even O
being O
ridiculed O
in O
your H
own O
milieu N
, O
can O
only O
happen O
in O
this O
region N
. O

Mr. N
Sahaf O
eventually O
became O
a O
popular O
icon N
as O
a O
court N
jester H
, O
but O
this O
did O
not O
stop N
some O
allegedly O
respectable O
newspapers N
from O
giving O
him O
equal O
time N
. O

It O
also O
does O
not O
prevent O
the O
Western O
press N
from O
giving O
credence N
, O
every O
day N
, O
even O
now O
, O
to O
similar O
liars H
. O

After O
all O
, O
if O
you H
want O
to O
be O
an O
anti-Semite H
, O
there O
are O
subtle O
ways N
of O
doing O
it O
. O

You H
do O
not O
have O
to O
claim O
that O
the O
holocaust O
never O
happened O
, O
and O
that O
the O
Jewish O
temple N
in O
Jerusalem O
never O
existed O
. O

But O
millions N
of O
Moslems O
are O
told O
by O
their O
leaders H
that O
this O
is O
the O
case N
. O

When O
these O
same O
leaders H
make O
other O
statements N
, O
the O
Western O
media N
report N
them O
as O
if O
they O
could O
be O
true O
. O

It O
is O
a O
daily O
occurrence N
that O
the O
same O
people N
who O
finance O
, O
arm N
and O
dispatch N
suicide N
murderers H
, O
condemn O
the O
act N
in O
English O
in O
front N
of O
western O
TV N
cameras N
, O
talking O
to O
a O
world N
audience N
, O
which O
even O
partly O
believes O
them O
. O

It O
is O
a O
daily O
routine N
to O
hear O
the O
same O
leader H
making O
opposite N
statements N
in O
Arabic O
to O
his O
people N
and O
in O
English O
to O
the O
rest N
of O
the O
world N
. O

Incitement N
by O
Arab O
TV N
, O
accompanied O
by O
horror N
pictures N
of O
mutilated O
bodies N
, O
has O
become O
a O
powerful O
weapon N
of O
those O
who O
lie O
, O
distort O
and O
want O
to O
destroy O
everything O
. O

Little O
children H
are O
raised O
on O
deep O
hatred N
and O
on O
admiration N
of O
so O
- O
called O
martyrs H
, O
and O
the O
Western O
World N
does O
not O
notice O
it O
because O
its O
own O
TV N
sets N
are O
mostly O
tuned O
to O
soap N
operas N
and O
game N
shows N
. O

I H
recommend O
to O
you H
, O
even O
though O
most O
of O
you H
do O
not O
understand O
Arabic O
, O
to O
watch O
Al H
Jazeera O
, O
from O
time N
to O
time N
. O

You H
will O
not O
believe O
your H
own O
eyes N
. O

But O
words N
also O
work N
in O
other O
ways N
, O
more O
subtle O
. O

A H
demonstration N
in O
Berlin O
, O
carrying O
banners N
supporting O
Saddam's O
Saddam H
's H
regime N
and O
featuring O
three O
- O
year N
old O
babies H
dressed O
as O
suicide N
murderers H
, O
is O
defined O
by O
the O
press N
and O
by O
political O
leaders H
as O
a O
" O
peace N
demonstration N
" O
. O

You H
may O
support N
or O
oppose O
the O
Iraq O
war N
, O
but O
to O
refer O
to O
fans H
of O
Saddam H
, O
Arafat O
or O
Bin H
Laden O
as O
peace N
activists H
is O
a O
bit N
too O
much O
. O

A H
woman H
walks O
into O
an O
Israeli O
restaurant N
in O
mid-day O
, O
eats O
, O
observes O
families N
with O
old O
people N
and O
children H
eating O
their O
lunch N
in O
the O
adjacent O
tables N
and O
pays O
the O
bill N
. O

She O
then O
blows O
herself O
up O
, O
killing O
20 O
people N
, O
including O
many O
children H
, O
with O
heads N
and O
arms N
rolling O
around O
in O
the O
restaurant N
. O

She O
is O
called O
" O
martyr H
" O
by O
several O
Arab O
leaders H
and O
called O
" O
activist H
" O
by O
the O
European O
press N
. O

Dignitaries H
condemn O
the O
act N
but O
visit O
her O
bereaved O
family H
and O
the O
money N
flows N
. O

There O
is O
a O
new O
game N
in O
town N
: O
The O
actual O
murderer H
is O
called O
" O
the O
military O
wing N
" O
, O
the O
one N
who O
pays O
him O
, O
equips O
him O
and O
sends O
him O
is O
now O
called O
" O
the O
political O
wing N
" O
and O
the O
head N
of O
the O
operation N
is O
called O
the O
" O
spiritual O
leader H
" O
. O

There O
are O
numerous O
other O
examples N
of O
such O
Orwellian O
nomenclature N
, O
used O
every O
day N
not O
only O
by O
terror N
chiefs O
but O
also O
by O
Western O
media N
. O

These O
words N
are O
much O
more O
dangerous O
than O
many O
people N
realize O
. O

They O
provide O
an O
emotional O
infrastructure N
for O
atrocities N
. O

It O
was O
Joseph H
Goebbels O
who O
said O
that O
if O
you H
repeat O
a O
lie O
often O
enough O
, O
people N
will O
believe O
it O
. O

He O
is O
now O
being O
outperformed O
by O
his O
successors H
. O

* O
3 O
. O
The O
third O
aspect N
is O
money N
. O
* O

Huge O
amounts N
of O
money N
, O
which O
could O
have O
solved O
many O
social O
problems N
in O
this O
dysfunctional O
part N
of O
the O
world N
, O
are O
channeled O
into O
three O
concentric O
spheres N
supporting O
death N
and O
murder O
. O

In O
the O
inner O
circle N
are O
the O
terrorists H
themselves O
. O

The O
money N
funds N
their O
travel O
, O
explosives N
, O
hideouts N
and O
permanent O
search N
for O
soft O
vulnerable O
targets N
. O

The O
inner O
circles O
are O
primarily O
financed O
by O
terrorist H
states N
like O
Iran O
and O
Syria O
, O
until O
recently O
also O
by O
Iraq O
and O
Libya O
and O
earlier O
also O
by O
some O
of O
the O
Communist O
regimes N
. O

These O
states N
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
Palestinian O
Authority O
, O
are O
the O
safe O
havens N
of O
the O
wholesale N
murder O
vendors H
. O

They O
are O
surrounded O
by O
a O
second N
wider O
circle N
of O
direct O
supporters H
, O
planners H
, O
commanders H
, O
preachers H
, O
all O
of O
whom O
make O
a O
living O
, O
usually O
a O
very O
comfortable O
living O
, O
by O
serving O
as O
terror N
infrastructure N
. O

Finally O
, O
we H
find O
the O
third O
circle N
of O
so O
- O
called O
religious O
, O
educational O
and O
welfare N
organizations N
, O
which O
actually O
do O
some O
good O
, O
feed O
the O
hungry O
and O
provide O
some O
schooling O
, O
but O
brainwash O
a O
new O
generation N
with O
hatred N
, O
lies N
and O
ignorance N
. O

This O
circle N
operates O
mostly O
through O
mosques N
, O
madrasas N
and O
other O
religious O
establishments N
but O
also O
through O
inciting O
electronic O
and O
printed O
media N
. O

It O
is O
this O
circle N
that O
makes O
sure O
that O
women H
remain O
inferior O
, O
that O
democracy N
is O
unthinkable O
and O
that O
exposure N
to O
the O
outside O
world N
is O
minimal O
. O

It O
is O
also O
that O
circle N
that O
leads O
the O
way N
in O
blaming O
everybody O
outside O
the O
Moslem O
world N
, O
for O
the O
miseries N
of O
the O
region N
. O

The O
outer O
circle N
is O
largely O
financed O
by O
Saudi O
Arabia O
, O
but O
also O
by O
donations N
from O
certain O

be O
noble O

agents H

the O
outer O
circle N

The O
Saudi O
regime N
, O
of O
course N
, O
will O
be O
the O
next O
victim H
of O
major O
terror N
, O
when O
the O
inner O
circle N
will O
explode O
into O
the O
outer O
circle N
. O

The O
Saudis O
are O
beginning O
to O
understand O
it O
, O
but O
they O
fight N
the O
inner O
circles O
, O
while O
still O
financing N
the O
infrastructure N
at O
the O
outer O
circle N
. O

Figuratively O
speaking O
, O
this O
outer O
circle N
is O
the O
guardian H
, O
which O
makes O
sure O
that O
the O
people N
look O
and O
listen O
inwards O
to O
the O
inner O
circle N
of O
terror N
and O
incitement N
, O
rather O
than O
to O
the O
world N
outside O
. O

Some O
parts N
of O
this O
same O
outer O
circle N
actually O
operate O
as O
a O
result N
of O
fear N
from O
, O
or O
blackmail N
by O
, O
the O
inner O
circles O

The O
horrifying O
added O
factor N

high O

Half O
of O
the O
population N

the O
Arab O
world N
is O
under O
the O
age N

20 O

the O
most O
receptive O
age N
to O
incitement N

guaranteeing O
two O
more O
generations A
of O
blind O
hatred N

Some O
of O
the O
leaders H

very O
comfortably O

The O
fourth O
element N
of O
the O
current O
world N
conflict N
is O
the O
total N
breaking O
of O
all O
laws N
. O
* O

The O
civilized O
world N
believes O
in O
democracy N
, O
the O
rule N
of O
law N
, O
including O
international O
law N
, O
human O
rights N
, O
free O
speech N
and O
free O
press N
, O
among O
other O
liberties N
. O

There O
are O
naive O
old O
- O
fashioned O
habits N
such O
as O
respecting O
religious O
sites N
and O
symbols N
, O
not O
using O
ambulances N
and O
hospitals N
for O
acts N
of O
war N
, O
avoiding O
the O
mutilation N
of O
dead O
bodies N
and O
not O
using O
children H
as O
human O
shields N
or O
human O
bombs N
. O

Never O
in O
history N
, O
not O
even O
in O
the O
Nazi O
period N
, O
was O
there O
such O
total N
disregard N
of O
all O
of O
the O
above O
as O
we H
observe O
now O
. O

Every O
student H
of O
political O
science N
debates N
how O
you H
prevent O
an O
anti-democratic O
force N
from O
winning O
a O
democratic O
election N
and O
abolishing O
democracy N
. O

Other O
aspects N
of O
a O
civilized O
society N
must O
also O
have O
limitations N
. O

Can O
a O
policeman H
open O
fire N
on O
someone H
trying O
to O
kill O
him O
? O

Can O
a O
government N
listen O
to O
phone N
conversations N
of O
terrorists H
and O
drug N
dealers N
? O

Does O
free O
speech N
protect O
you H
when O
you H
shout N
" O
fire N
" O
in O
a O
crowded O
theater N
? O

Should O
there O
be O
death N
penalty N
, O
for O
deliberate O
multiple O
murders O
? O

These O
are O
the O
old O
- O
fashioned O
dilemmas N
. O

But O
now O
we H
have O
an O
entire O
new O
set O
. O

Do O
you H
raid O
a O
mosque N
, O
which O
serves O
as O
a O
terrorist H
ammunition N
storage N
? O

Do O
you H
return O
fire N
, O
if O
you H
are O
attacked O
from O
a O
hospital N
? O

Do O
you H
storm N
a O
church N
taken O
over O
by O
terrorists H
who O
took O
the O
priests H
hostages H
? O

Do O
you H
search N
every O
ambulance N
after O
a O
few O
suicide N
murderers H
use O
ambulances N
to O
reach O
their O
targets N
? O

Do O
you H
strip N
every O
woman H
because O
one N
pretended O
to O
be O
pregnant O
and O
carried O
a O
suicide N
bomb N
on O
her O
belly N
? O

Do O
you H
shoot N
back O
at O
someone H
trying O
to O
kill O
you H
, O
standing N
deliberately O
behind O
a O
group N
of O
children H
? O

Do O
you H
raid O
terrorist H
headquarters N
, O
hidden O
in O
a O
mental O
hospital N
? O

Do O
you H
shoot N
an O
arch-murderer O
who O
deliberately O
moves O
from O
one N
location N
to O
another O
, O
always O
surrounded O
by O
children H
? O

All O
of O
these O
happen O
daily O
in O
Iraq O
and O
in O
the O
Palestinian O
areas N
. O

What O
do O
you H
do O
? O

Well O
, O
you H
do O
not O
want O
to O
face N
the O
dilemma N
. O

But O
it O
cannot O
can O
not O
be O
avoided O
. O

Suppose O
, O
for O
the O
sake N
of O
discussion N
, O
that O
someone H
would O
openly O
stay O
in O
a O
well O
- O
known O
address N
in O
Teheran O
, O
hosted O
by O
the O
Iranian O
Government O
and O
financed O
by O
it O
, O
executing O
one N
atrocity N
after O
another O
in O
Spain O
or O
in O
France O
, O
killing O
hundreds N
of O
innocent O
people N
, O
accepting O
responsibility N
for O
the O
crimes N
, O
promising O
in O
public O
TV N
interviews N
to O
do O
more O
of O
the O
same O
, O
while O
the O
Government O
of O
Iran O
issues N
public O
condemnations N
of O
his O
acts N
but O
continues O
to O
host H
him O
, O
invite O
him O
to O
official O
functions N
and O
treat O
him O
as O
a O
great O
dignitary H
. O

I H
leave O
it O
to O
you H
as O
homework N
to O
figure O
out O
what O
Spain O
or O
France O
would O
have O
done O
, O
in O
such O
a O
situation N
. O

The O
problem N
is O
that O
the O
civilized O
world N
is O
still O
having O
illusions N
about O
the O
rule N
of O
law N
in O
a O
totally O
lawless O
environment N
. O

It O
is O
trying O
to O
play O
ice N
hockey N
by O
sending O
a O
ballerina H
ice N
- O
skater H
into O
the O
ring N
or O
to O
knock O
out O
a O
heavyweight H
boxer H
by O
a O
chess N
player H
. O

In O
the O
same O
way N
that O
no O
country N
has O
a O
law N
against O
cannibals H
eating O
its O
prime O
minister H
, O
because O
such O
an O
act N
is O
unthinkable O
, O
international O
law N
does O
not O
address N
killers H
shooting N
from O
hospitals N
, O
mosques N
and O
ambulances N
, O
while O
being O
protected O
by O
their O
Government O
or O
society N
. O

International O
law N
does O
not O
know O
how O
to O
handle N
someone H
who O
sends O
children H
to O
throw O
stones N
, O
stands O
behind O
them O
and O
shoots N
with O
immunity N
and O
cannot O
can O
not O
be O
arrested O
because O
he O
is O
sheltered O
by O
a O
Government O
. O

International O
law N
does O
not O
know O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
leader H
of O
murderers H
who O
is O
royally O
and O
comfortably O
hosted O
by O
a O
country N
, O
which O
pretends O
to O
condemn O
his O
acts N
or O
just O
claims N
to O
be O
too O
weak O
to O
arrest N
him O
. O

The O
amazing O
thing N
is O
that O
all O
of O
these O
crooks H
demand N
protection N
under O
international O
law N
, O
and O
define O
all O
those O
who O
attack N
them O
as O
" O
war N
criminals H
, O
" O
with O
some O
Western O
media N
repeating N
the O
allegations N
. O

The O
good O
news N
is O
that O
all O
of O
this O
is O
temporary O
, O
because O
the O
evolution N
of O
international O
law N
has O
always O
adapted O
itself O
to O
reality N
. O

The O
punishment N
for O
suicide N
murder O
should O
be O
death N
or O
arrest N
before O
the O
murder O
, O
not O
during O
and O
not O
after O
. O

After O
every O
world N
war N
, O
the O
rules N
of O
international O
law N
have O
changed O
, O
and O
the O
same O
will O
happen O
after O
the O
present N
one N
. O

But O
during O
the O
twilight N
zone N
, O
a O
lot N
of O
harm O
can O
be O
done O
. O

The O
picture N
I H
described O
here O
is O
not O
pretty O
. O

What O
can O
we H
do O
about O
it O
? O

In O
the O
short O
run O
, O
only O
fight N
and O
win O
. O

In O
the O
long O
run O
, O
only O
educate O
the O
next O
generation N
and O
open O
it O
to O
the O
world N
. O

The O
inner O
circles O
can O
and O
must O
be O
destroyed O
by O
force N
. O

The O
outer O
circle N
cannot O
can O
not O
be O
eliminated O
by O
force N
. O

Here O
we H
need O
financial O
starvation N
of O
the O
organizing O
elite O
, O
more O
power N
to O
women H
, O
more O
education N
, O
counter-propaganda O
, O
boycott N
whenever O
feasible O
and O
access O
to O
Western O
media N
, O
internet N
and O
the O
international O
scene N
. O

Above O
all O
, O
we H
need O
a O
total N
absolute O
unity N
and O
determination N
of O
the O
civilized O
world N
against O
all O
three O
circles O
of O
evil O
. O

Allow O
me H
, O
for O
a O
moment N
, O
to O
depart O
from O
my H
alleged O
role N
as O
a O
taxi N
driver H
and O
return O
to O
science N
. O

When O
you H
have O
a O
malignant O
tumor N
, O
you H
may O
remove O
the O
tumor N
itself O
surgically O
. O

You H
may O
also O
starve O
it O
by O
preventing O
new O
blood N
from O
reaching O
it O
from O
other O
parts N
of O
the O
body N
, O
thereby O
preventing O
new O
" O
supplies N
" O
from O
expanding O
the O
tumor N
. O

If O
you H
want O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
it O
is O
best O
to O
do O
both O
. O

But O
before O
you H
fight N
and O
win O
, O
by O
force N
or O
otherwise O
, O
you H
have O
to O
realize O
that O
you H
are O
in O
a O
war N
, O
and O
this O
may O
take O
Europe O
a O
few O
more O
years N
. O

In O
order O
to O
win O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
first O
eliminate O
the O
terrorist H
regimes N
, O
so O
that O
no O
Government O
in O
the O
world N
will O
serve O
as O
a O
safe O
haven N
for O
these O
people N
. O

I H
do O
not O
want O
to O
comment O
here O
on O
whether O
the O
American O
- O
led O
attack N
on O
Iraq O
was O
justified O
from O
the O
point N
of O
view N
of O
weapons N
of O
mass O
destruction N
or O
any O
other O
pre-war O
argument N
, O
but O
I H
can O
look O
at O
the O
post-war O
map N
of O
Western O
Asia O
. O

Now O
that O
Afghanistan O
, O
Iraq O
and O
Libya O
are O
out O
, O
two O
and O
a O
half O
terrorist H
states N
remain O
: O
Iran O
, O
Syria O
and O
Lebanon O
, O
the O
latter N
being O
a O
Syrian O
colony N
. O

Perhaps O
Sudan O
should O
be O
added O
to O
the O
list N
. O

As O
a O
result N
of O
the O
conquest N
of O
Afghanistan O
and O
Iraq O
, O
both O
Iran O
and O
Syria O
are O
now O
totally O
surrounded O
by O
territories N
unfriendly O
to O
them O
. O

Iran O
is O
encircled O
by O
Afghanistan O
, O
by O
the O
Gulf O
States O
, O
Iraq O
and O
the O
Moslem O
republics N
of O
the O
former O
Soviet O
Union O
. O

Syria O
is O
surrounded O
by O
Turkey O
, O
Iraq O
, O
Jordan H
and O
Israel O
. O

This O
is O
a O
significant O
strategic O
change O
and O
it O
applies O
strong O
pressure O
on O
the O
terrorist H
countries N
. O

It O
is O
not O
surprising O
that O
Iran O
is O
so O
active O
in O
trying O
to O
incite O
a O
Shiite O
uprising N
in O
Iraq O
. O

I H
do O
not O
know O
if O
the O
American O
plan N
was O
actually O
to O
encircle O
both O
Iran O
and O
Syria O
, O
but O
that O
is O
the O
resulting O
situation N
. O

In O
my H
humble O
opinion N
, O
the O
number N
one N
danger N
to O
the O
world N
today N
is O
Iran O
and O
its O
regime N
. O

It O
definitely O
has O
ambitions N
to O
rule N
vast O
areas N
and O
to O
expand O
in O
all O
directions N
. O

It O
has O
an O
ideology N
which O
claims N
supremacy N
over O
Western O
culture N
. O

It O
is O
ruthless O
. O

It O
has O
proven O
that O
it O
can O
execute O
elaborate O
terrorist H
acts N
without O
leaving O
too O
many O
traces N
, O
using O
Iranian O
Embassies O
. O

It O
is O
clearly O
trying O
to O
develop O
nuclear O
weapons N
. O

Its O
so O
- O
called O
moderates H
and O
conservatives H
play O
their O
own O
virtuoso O
version N
of O
the O
" O
good O
- O
cop O
versus O
bad O
- O
cop O
" O
game N
. O

Iran O
sponsors O
Syrian O
terrorism N
, O
it O
is O
certainly O
behind O
much O
of O
the O
action N
in O
Iraq O
, O
it O
is O
fully O
funding N
the O
Hezbollah O
and O
, O
through O
it O
, O
the O
Palestinian O
Hamas O
and O
Islamic O
Jihad O
; O
it O
performed O
acts N
of O
terror N
at O
least O
in O
Europe O
and O
in O
South O
America O
and O
probably O
also O
in O
Uzbekistan O
and O
Saudi O
Arabia O
and O
it O
truly O
leads O
a O
multi-national O
terror N
consortium N
, O
which O
includes O
, O
as O
minor O
players H
, O
Syria O
, O
Lebanon O
and O
certain O
Shiite O
elements N
in O
Iraq O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
most O
European O
countries N
still O
trade N
with O
Iran O
, O
try O
to O
appease O
it O
and O
refuse O
to O
read O
the O
clear N
signals N
. O

In O
order O
to O
win O
the O
war N
it O
is O
also O
necessary O
to O
dry H
the O
financial O
resources N
of O
the O
terror N
conglomerate N
. O

It O
is O
pointless O
to O
try O
to O
understand O
the O
subtle O
differences N
between O
the O
Sunni O
terror N
of O
Al H
Qaeda O
and O
Hamas O
and O
the O
Shiite O
terror N
of O
Hezbollah O
, O
Sadr O
and O
other O
Iranian O
- O
inspired O
enterprises N
. O

When O
it O
serves O
their O
business N
needs N
, O
all O
of O
them O
collaborate O
beautifully O
. O

It O
is O
crucial O
to O
stop N
Saudi O
and O
other O
financial O
support N
of O
the O
outer O
circle N
, O
which O
is O
the O
fertile O
breeding O
ground N
of O
terror N
. O

It O
is O
important O
to O
monitor O
all O
donations N
from O
the O
Western O
World N
to O
Islamic O
organizations N
, O
to O
monitor O
the O
finances N
of O
international O
relief N
organizations N
and O
to O
react O
with O
forceful O
economic O
measures N
to O
any O
small O
sign N
of O
financial O
aid N
to O
any O
of O
the O
three O
circles O
of O
terrorism N
. O

It O
is O
also O
important O
to O
act N
decisively O
against O
the O
campaign N
of O
lies N
and O
fabrications N
and O
to O
monitor O
those O
Western O
media N
who O
collaborate O
with O
it O
out O
of O
naivety N
, O
financial O
interests N
or O
ignorance N
. O

Above O
all O
, O
never O
surrender N
to O
terror N
. O

No O
one N
will O
ever O
know O
whether O
the O
recent O
elections N
in O
Spain O
would O
have O
yielded O
a O
different O
result N
, O
if O
not O
for O
the O
train N
bombings N
a O
few O
days N
earlier O
. O

But O
it O
really O
does O
not O
matter N
. O

What O
matters N
is O
that O
the O
terrorists H
believe O
that O
they O
caused O
the O
result N
and O
that O
they O
won O
by O
driving O
Spain O
out O
of O
Iraq O

The O
Spanish O
story N
will O
surely O
end N
up O
being O
extremely O
costly O
to O
other O
European O
countries N
, O
including O
France O
, O
who O
is O
now O
expelling O
inciting O
preachers H
and O
forbidding O
veils N
and O
including O
others O
who O
sent O
troops N
to O
Iraq O
. O

In O
the O
long O
run O
, O
Spain O
itself O
will O
pay O
even O
more O
. O

Is O
the O
solution N
a O
democratic O
Arab O
world N
? O

If O
by O
democracy N
we H
mean O
free O
elections N
but O
also O
free O
press N
, O
free O
speech N
, O
a O
functioning N
judicial O
system N
, O
civil O
liberties N
, O
equality N
to O
women H
, O
free O
international O
travel O
, O
exposure N
to O
international O

ideas N
, O

against O

incitement N

against O

, O
and O
avoidance N
of O
lawless O
behavior N
regarding O
hospitals N
, O
places N
of O
worship N
and O
children H
, O
then O
yes O
, O
democracy N
is O
the O
solution N
. O

If O
democracy N
is O
just O
free O
elections N
, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
the O
most O
fanatic O
regime N
will O
be O
elected O
, O
the O
one N
whose O
incitement N
and O
fabrications N
are O
the O
most O
inflammatory O
. O

We H
have O
seen O
it O
already O
in O
Algeria O
and O
, O
to O
a O
certain O
extent N
, O
in O
Turkey O
. O

It O
will O
happen O
again O
, O
if O
the O
ground N
is O
not O
prepared O
very O
carefully O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand N
, O
a O
certain O
transition N
democracy N
, O
as O
in O
Jordan H
, O
may O
be O
a O
better O
temporary O
solution N
, O
paving O
the O
way N
for O
the O
real O
thing N
, O
perhaps O
in O
the O
same O
way N
that O
an O
immediate O
sudden O
democracy N
did O
not O
work N
in O
Russia O
and O
would O
not O
have O
worked O
in O
China O
. O

I H
have O
no O
doubt O
that O
the O
civilized O
world N
will O
prevail O
. O

But O
the O
longer O
it O
takes O
us H
to O
understand O
the O
new O
landscape N
of O
this O
war N
, O
the O
more O
costly O
and O
painful O
the O
victory N
will O
be O
. O

Europe O
, O
more O
than O
any O
other O
region N
, O
is O
the O
key N
. O

Its O
understandable O
recoil N
from O
wars N
, O
following O
the O
horrors N
of O
World N
War N
II O
, O
may O
cost O
thousands N

innocent O

( O

behind O
the O
earlier O
Fall N

that O
the O
mailings N

as O
a O
threat N

warning N
. O

Princeton O
islamist O
scholar H
Bernard H
Lewis H
has O
explained O
that O
while O

may O
disagree O
about O
whether O
killing O
innocents H
is O
sanctioned O
by O
the O
laws N

before O

He O
explained O
that O

The O

Al H

has O
had O
anthrax N
, O
the O
raw O
seed N

in O
its O

form N
, O
since O
at O

1997 O
, O
when O
it O
was O

known O
of O
Zawahiri's O
Zawahiri O

plans N

a O
half O

. O

The O
confidante H
and O
right O
- O
hand N
man H
of O
Dr. O
Ayman O
Zawahiri O
admitted O
that O
Zawahiri O
succeeded O
in O

intended O
to O
use O
it O
against O

he O
confirmed O
the O
report N
in O
a O
sworn O
lengthy O
confession N

Even O
Zawahiri's O
Zawahiri O

attorney H
in O
1999 O
said O
that O

Zawahiri O
were O
likely O
to O
resort N
to O
the O

A H
recently O
released O
islamist O
who O
had O
been O
a O
close O

of O
Zawahiri O
said O
that O
Zawahiri O
spent O
a O
decade N

had O
made O
15 O
separate O
attempts N
to O
recruit O
the O
necessary O
expertise N
to O
weaponize O
anthrax N
in O
Russia O
and O
the O
Middle O
East O
. O

The O
US O
Army N
recipe N
was O
not O
used O
, O
and O
obtaining O
the O
unprocessed O
Ames O
strain O
of O
anthrax N
used O
does O
not O
warrant O
the O
weight N
given O
it O
by O
some O
press N
accounts O
. O

There O
was O
lax O
control N
over O
the O
distribution N
of O
the O
Ames O
strain O
that O
was O
used O
, O
especially O
in O
light N
of O
the O
fact N
that O
transfers N
were O
not O
even O
required O
to O
be O
recorded O
prior O
to O
1997 O
. O

Significantly O
, O
the O

who O
isolated O

nearly O
a O
quarter N
century N

( O
now O
retired O
) O
, O
upon O
being O

does O
not O
even O

Senator O
Patrick H
Leahy O
at O
a O
Congressional O
hearing O
in O
the O

noted O
that O

In O

not O
evidence N

At O
least O
according O
to O
the O
public O
comments N
by O
bioweaponeer O
experts H
William H
Patrick H
and O
Kenneth H
Alibek O
, O
under O
the O
optimal O
method N

there O

no O

In O
the O
case N
of O
the O
anthrax N
used O
in O
the O
mailings N
, O
there O
was O
an O
electrostatic O
charge O

Although O
there O
was O
a O
dominance N
of O
single O
spores N

a O

, O
there O
were O
clumps N

large O

40 O

( O
Spores N
must O
be O
no O
bigger O

) O

Many O
point N
to O
the O

extraordinary O
. O

It O
is O
far O
simpler O
, O
however O
, O
to O
achieve O
a O

concentration N
in O
the O
production N
of O
a O

in O
industrial O

typical O
of O
a O

The O
" O

issue N
was O
at O
the O
heart N
of O
a O
lot N
of O
mistaken O
theories N
of O
the O

concluding O
that O
state N
sponsorship N
was O
necessarily O
indicated O

The O

undermines O
the O

the O

on O
Dr. O

they O

USDA O

Khalid H

that O
Zacarias O

related O
to O

Although O
the O
details N
of O
the O

on O
Mohammed's O
Mohammed H

may O
( O
or O
may O
not O
) O
point N

they O
are O
fully O
consistent O
with O
the O

Al H

both O

met O
with O

a O

October O
2001 O

The O

Sufaat O
was O
arrested O
in O
December O
2001 O
upon O
his O
return O

Newsweek O

Yet O
all O

the O

It O

Khalid H

Siddiqui O
, O
who O
has O
a O
PhD N

The O

late O
March O

early O
April O

If O
mistaken O
, O
how O
did O
those O
reports N
first O
come O
about O
? O

Understandably O
, O
Amerithrax O
is O
a O
confidential O
investigation N
. O

The O
Pakistan O
ISI O
and O
CIA O
rarely O
grant N
press N
interviews N
in O
connection N
with O
an O
ongoing O
manhunt N
. O

The O
CIA O
did O
not O
even O
allow O
the O
FBI O
access O
to O
KSM O
for O
10 O
days N
after O
his O
arrest N
. O

As O
agent H
Van H
Harp O
, O
then O
head N
of O
the O
Amerithrax O
investigation N
said O
, O
the O
information N
coming O
from O
Khalid H
Mohammed H
is O
classified O
with O
the O
authorities H
releasing O
only O
certain O
limited O
information N

While O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
easy O
to O
separate O
fact N
from O
fiction N
, O
Attorney H
General O
Ashcroft O
and O
Director O
Mueller O
have O
publicly O
confirmed O
Aafia O
is O
still O
being O
sought O
. O

They O
would O
know O
. O

Her O
mother H
Ismat O
last O
saw O
Aafia O
and O
her O
grandchildren H
before O
they O
left O
in O
a O
minicab N
at O
the O
end N
of O
March O

Aafia O
was O
on O
her O
way N
with O
her O
children H
to O
visit O
and O
uncle H
and O
a O
friend H
in O
Islamabad O
. O

According O
to O
the O
Pakistan O
reports N
, O
Aafia O
Siddiqui O
was O
detained O
after O
being O
spotted O
at O
Karachi O
International O

( O
after O
she O

. O

( O
Karachi O
is O
in O

. O

The O
reports N

suspected O
of O
having O
been O
a O

Al H

" O
Chemical O

" O

The O
family's O
family H

lawyer H
advises O
me H
that O
Aafia O
did O
not O
have O
enough O
money N
to O
pay O
for O
airfare N
tickets N
for O
herself O
and O
the O
kids H

called O
Ismat O
from O

That O
was O
the O

Ismat O
heard O
from O
her O
. O

Aafia O
never O
reached O
the O
uncle's O
uncle H
's H
house N

Perhaps O
something O
got O
lost O
in O
the O
translation N

but O
the O
phrase N
" O
Chemical O

" O
has O
appeared O
in O
all O
the O
english O
Pakistan O

India O
papers N

The O
family's O
family H

attorney H
advises O
me H
that O
Aafia O
had O
no O
knowledge N
of O
chemicals N
( O
and O
that O
would O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
her O

There O
still O
is O
a O
very O
hot O
pursuit N

level N
" O
Floridian O

Adnan O
El H
Shukrijumah O

His O
nickname N

Jafar O

" O

A H
senior H
DOJ O
official O
reports N
that O
Adnan O
has O
experience N
as O
a O
commercial O
pilot O
. O

He O
is O
said O
by O
one N
FBI O
agent H
to O
be O
" O
very O
, O
very O
, O
very O
" O
dangerous O
. O

He O
allegedly O
was O
at O
one N

more O
meetings N
in O
the O
Summer N
of O
2001 O
in O
Pakistan O
at O
which O
KSM O

He O
may O
have O
been O
seen O
in O
Hamilton O
, O
Canada O
-- O
along O
with O
Egyptian O
al O

Maati O
, O
who O
apparently O
also O
has O
received O
pilot O
training N
. O

The O
United O
States O
truly O
no O
longer O
has O
time N
for O
faulty O
analysis N
or O
politically O

based O
preconceptions N
. O

In O
early O
June O
2003 O
, O
a O
CIA O
report N
concluded O
that O
the O
reason N
for O
Atta's O
Atta O
's H
and O
Zacarias O
Moussaoui's O
Moussaoui O
's H
inquiries N
into O
cropdusters O
was O
in O
fact N
for O
the O
contemplated O
use O
in O
dispersing O
biological O
agents H
such O
as O
anthrax N
. O

It O
has O
long O
been O
known O
Osama O
Bin H

was O
interested O
in O
using O
cropdusters O
to O
disperse O
biological O
agents H
( O
since O
the O
testimony N
of O
millennium N
bomber H
Ahmed H

) O
. O

The O
hijacker H
Ahmed H
Alhaznawi O
appears O
to O
have O
contracted O
cutaneous O
anthrax N
in O
Afghanistan O
. O

It O
is O
reasonable O
to O
credit N
his O
statement N
that O
he O
got O
the O
lesion N
after O
bumping O
into O
a O
suitcase N
he O
was O
carrying O
at O
a O
camp N
in O
Afghanistan O
. O

The O
lesion N
is O
further O
evidence N
of O
Al H

anthrax N
production N
program N
at O
Kandahar O
. O

The O
present N
evidence N
relating O
to O
Atta's O
Atta O

alleged O
travel O
to O
Prague O
does O
not O
warrant O
a O
conclusion N
that O
Al H

obtained O
the O
Ames H
strain O
from O
Iraq O
. O

Iraq O
, O
however O
, O
remains O
a O
possible O

travel O

with O
an O

that O
an O

sent O
to O
the O
Iraqi O
capital N

March O

According O
to O
at O

some O
reports N
, O
Bin H

rejected O
the O
suggestion N
of O
a O
closer O
alliance N

preferring O
to O

The O

been O
seriously O
confused O
on O
the O
issue N
of O
motive N

the O
reason N
Senators O

would O
have O
been O
targeted O
-- O
tending O
to O
simplistically O
view N

" O

Zawahiri O
likely O
targeted O
Senators O
Daschle O
and O
Leahy O
to O
receive O
anthrax N
letters N
, O
in O
addition N
to O
various O

the O
appropriations N

pursuant O
to O
the O
" O
Leahy O
Law O
" O
to O
military O
and O
security N
forces N
. O

That O
money N
has O
prevented O
the O
militant O
islamists H
from O
achieving O
their O
goals N
. O

Al H
Qaeda O
members H
and O
sympathizers H
feel O
that O
the O
FBI's O
FBI O

involvement N
in O
countries N
like O
Egypt O
, O
Saudi O
Arabia O
, O
Pakistan O
, O

, O

the O

interferes O
with O
the O

countries N

According O
to O
a O
post N
she O
made O
on O
the O
internet N
, O
Aafia O
Siddiqui O
expressed O
the O
same O
sentiment N
in O
connection N
with O
US O
appropriations N
sought O
in O
exchange O
for O
the O
extradition N
of O
WTC O
1993 O
plotter H
Ramzi O
Yousef O
from O
Pakistan O
. O

Senator O
Leahy O
was O
Chairman O

both O
the O

Committee N
overseeing O
the O
FBI O
and O
Appropriations O
Subcommittee O
in O
charge O
of O
foreign O
aid N
to O
these O
countries N

In O
late O
September O
2001 O
, O
it O
was O
announced O
that O
the O
President H
was O
seeking O
a O
blanket N
waiver N
that O
would O
lift O
all O
restrictions N
on O
aid N
to O
military O
and O
security N
units N
in O
connection N
with O
pursuing O
the O
militant O

This O
extradition N
and O
imprisonment N
of O
Al H

leaders H
, O
along O
with O
US O
support N
for O
Israel O
and O
the O
Mubarak O
government N
in O
Egypt O
, O
remains O
foremost O
in O
the O
mind N
of O
Dr. O
Zawahiri O
. O

At O
the O
height N
of O
the O
development N
of O
his O
biological O
weapons N
program N
, O
his O
brother H
was O
extradited O
pursuant O
to O
a O
death N
sentence N
in O
the O
" O
Albanian O
returnees O
" O
case N
( O
now O
he O
faces N
retrial N
) O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
hard O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
stories N
about O
billion O
dollar N
appropriations N
, O
debt N
forgiveness N
, O
and O
loan N
guarantees N
to O
countries N
like O
Egypt O
and O
Israel O
and O
now O
even O
Pakistan O
. O

Those O
appropriations N
pale O
in O
comparison N
to O
the O
many O
tens N
of O
billions N
in O
appropriations N
relating O
to O
the O
invasion N
of O
Iraq O
. O

Al H
Qaeda O
had O
a O
motive N
in O
mind N
. O

In O
his O
Fall N
2001 O
book O
titled O
Knights O
under O
the O
Banner O
of O
the O
Prophet H
, O
Zawahiri O
argued O
that O
the O
secular O
press N
was O
telling O
" O
lies N
" O
about O
the O
militant O
islamists H
-- O
to O
include O
the O
suggestion N
that O
the O
militant O
islamists H
were O
somehow O
the O
creation N
of O
the O
United O
States O
in O
connection N
with O
expelling O
the O
Russians O
from O
Afghanistan O
. O

Zawahiri O
argued O
instead O
that O
they O
have O
been O
active O
since O
the O
assassination N
of O
Anwar O
Sadat O
in O
Egypt O
because O
of O
the O
Camp O
David H
Accord O
and O
the O
resulting O
peace N
treaty N
between O
Egypt O
and O
Israel O
. O

The O
anthrax N
letters N
were O
sent O
on O
the O
date N
of O
the O
Camp O
David H
Accord O
and O
then O
the O
date N
Anwar O
Sadat O
was O
assassinated O
as O
if O
to O
underscore O
the O
point N
to O
anyone O
paying O
attention N
. O

Most O
of O
the O
" O
talking O
heads N
" O
on O
television N
, O
however O
, O
knew O
only O
that O
Daschle O
and O
Leahy O
were O
liberal O
democrats O
and O
did O
not O
know O
anything O
of O
Al H
Qaeda O
beyond O
what O
they O
read O
in O
the O
US O
newspapers N
. O

The O
FBI's O
FBI O
's H
profile N
includes O
a O
US O
- O
based O
supporter H
of O
the O
militant O
islamists H
. O

Attorney H
General O
Ashcroft O
explained O
that O
an O
" O
either O
- O
or O
" O
approach N
is O
not O
useful O
. O

The O
media N
has O
tended O
to O
overlook O
the O
fact N
that O
when O
the O
FBI O
uses O
the O
word N
" O
domestic O
" O
the O
word N
includes O
a O
US O
- O
based O
, O
highly O
- O
educated O
supporter H
of O
the O
militant O
islamists H
. O

There O
is O
an O
emerging O
consensus N
that O
anthrax N
was O
contained O
in O
a O
letter N
to O
AMI O
, O
the O
publisher N
of O

( O
as O

the O

that O
there O
were O
not O

two O

such O
mailings N

anthrax N

( O
The O

This O
tactic N
of O
letters N
is O
not O
merely O
the O
modus O
operandi O
of O
these O
militant O
islamists H
inspired O
by O
Zawahiri O
, O
it O
is O
their O
signature N
. O

The O
islamists H
sent O
letter N
bombs N
in O
January O
1997 O
to O
newspaper N
offices N
in O
New O
York H
City N
and O
Washington O
, O
D.C. O
. O

They O
were O
sent O
in O
connection N
with O
the O
earlier O
bombing N

the O
World N

the O
imprisonment N

" O
Islamic O
Group N

) O
, O
he O
was O
also O
a O
spiritual O
leader H
of O
Al H

. O

The O
letter N
bombs N
were O
sent O
in O
connection N
with O
the O
treatment N
of O
the O
Egyptian O
islamists H
imprisoned O
for O
the O
earlier O
attack N
on O
the O

a O

plot N
. O

The O
purpose N
of O
the O
letter N
bombs N

which O
resulted O
in O
minimal O
casualty H
-- O
was O
to O
send O
a O
message N

There O
was O
no O
claim O

There O

, O
the O
next O

on O
two O

Two O
bombs N

also O
sent O
to O
Leavenworth O
, O
where O
a O

The O

Abdel O
Rahman's O
Rahman H
's H
son H
was O
captured O
in O
Quetta O
, O
Pakistan O
in O
mid-February O
2003 O
. O

That O
arrest N
in O
turn O
led O
to O
the O
dramatic O
capture O
of O
Khalid H
Mohammed H
, O
Al H

's H
# O

. O

Mohammed H
allegedly O
was O
hiding O
in O
the O
home N
of O
the O
Pakistani O
bacteriologist H
Dr. O
Abdul H
Qadoos O
Khan H
. O

Along O
with O
Zawahiri O
, O
Abdel O
Rahman H
and O
his O
two O
sons H
have O
had O
considerable O
influence N
over O
Bin H
Laden O
. O

He O
reportedly O
treated O
them O
like O
sons H
. O

Although O
while O
in O
jail N
in O
the O
early O
1980s N
, O
Zawahiri O
caused O
considerable O
tension N
by O
challenging O
the O
blind O
sheik's O
sheik H
's H
ability N
to O
lead O
a O
coalition N
of O
the O
Egyptian O
Islamic O
Jihad O
and O
the O
Egyptian O
Islamic O
Group N
, O
Zawahiri O
and O
OBL O
are O
Rahman's O
Rahman H
's H
friends H
. O

The O
imprisoned O
WTC O
1993 O
plotter H
Yousef O
was O
KSM's O
KSM O
's H
nephew H
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
leaders H
in O
charge O
of O
Al H
Qaeda's O
Qaeda O
's H
anthrax N
production N
program N
had O
a O
close O
connection N
to O
those O
imprisoned O
in O
connection N
with O
the O
earlier O
bombing N
of O
the O
World N
Trade N
Center O

According O
to O
the O
controversial O
" O
Feith O
memo N
, O
" O
which O
summarized O
purported O
intelligence N
showing O
an O
Iraqi O
/ O
Al H

connection N
, O
Osama O
Bin H

had O
asked O
Iraqi O
intelligence N
for O
technical O
assistance N
in O
sending O
letter N
bombs N
a O
half O
year N
before O
the O
Al H
Hayat O
letters N
were O
sent O
. O

Just O
because O
Al H
Qaeda O
likes O
its O
truck N
bombs N
and O
the O
like O
to O
be O
effective O
does O
not O
mean O
they O
do O
not O
see O
the O
value N
in O
a O
deadly O
missive N
. O

As O
Brian H
Jenkins H
once O
said O
, O
" O
terrorism N
is O
theater N
. O
" O

A H
sender H
purporting O
to O
be O
islamist O
sent O
cyanide N

even O
a O

in O

Al H

The O
" O
Federal O

that O

In O
the O

and O
described O
the O

In O

between O
due O
process N
and O
national O
security N
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
" O
Hatfill O
theory N
" O
seems O
to O
have O
been O
exhausted O
or O
at O
least O
lost O
public O
favor N
. O

The O
" O
Hatfill O
theory N
" O
accusing O
Dr. O
Stephen H
Hatfill O
was O
always O
highly O
dubious O
. O

The O
suspicion N
was O
founded O
on O
many O
false O
premises N
, O
and O
there O
was O
no O
reliable O
publicly O
known O
evidence N
indicating O
his O
guilt N
. O

The O
FBI's O
FBI O
's H
fixation N
on O
Hatfill O
( O
at O
least O
as O
rumored O
by O
some O
reporters H
) O
may O
have O
stemmed O
from O
a O
warning N
by O
one N
Senator O
that O
careers N
hung O
in O
the O
balance O
. O

Leahy's O
Leahy O
's H
chief O
of O
staff N
apparently O
started O
with O
the O
strong O
predisposition N
that O
some O
right O
- O
winger H
was O
involved O
because O
two O
liberal O
democrats O
had O
been O
targeted O
. O

The O
Hatfill O
theory N
-- O
to O
include O
ongoing O
interviews N
and O
ongoing O
7 O
/ O
24 O
surveillance N
by O
8 O
surveillance N
specialists H
-- O
is O
now O
the O
subject O
of O
pending O
civil O
rights N
and O
libel N
claims N
of O
uncertain O
merit N
. O

A H
suit N
against O
the O
New O
York H
Times O
and O
columnist H
Nicholas H
Kristof O
was O
dismissed O
in O
late O
November O
2004 O
. O

The O
judge H
had O
agreed O
to O
delay N
the O
civil O
rights N
matter N
from O
proceeding O
until O
at O
least O
October O
2004 O
. O

The O
judge H
, O
frustrated O
by O
the O
apparent O
lack N
of O
progress N
, O
encouraged O
that O
the O
parties N
reach O
a O
negotiated O
compromise N
that O
would O
permit N
some O
limited O
discovery N
to O
proceed O
( O
and O
the O
judge H
has O
directed O
that O
the O
government N
to O
file N
an O
Answer N
to O
the O
Complaint N
) O
. O

The O
Hatfill O
Theory O
ironically O
might O
best O
be O
understood O
as O
an O
Al H
Qaeda O
theory N
, O
with O
a O
coincidental O
Malaysian O
connection N
adding O
to O
the O
other O
circumstances N
. O

Given O
the O
regrettable O
leaks O
that O
he O
was O
under O
suspicion N
, O
it O
is O
only O
fair O
that O
the O
FBI O
leak O
with O
equal O
enthusiasm N
the O
fact N
that O
Dr. O
Hatfill O
has O
now O
been O
dropped O
as O
a O
suspect O
if O
and O
when O
that O
proves O
to O
be O
the O
case N
. O

A H
search N
of O
Dr. O
Ken H
Berry's O
Berry H
's H
residences N
likely O
will O
prove O
just O
about O
the O
last O
gasp N
of O
a O
biodefense N
insider H
theory N
. O

Senior O
officials O
have O
been O
quoted O
in O
the O
press N
as O
saying O
that O
the O
searches N
were O
for O
the O
purpose N
of O
excluding O
him O
as O
much O
as O
including O
him O
. O

Maureen H
, O

Andre H
is O
going O
to O
look O
over O
the O
list N
of O
curves O
needed O
for O
the O
global O
assets N
( O
August O
Board O
meeting N
) O
one N
more O
time N
before O
I H
forward O
it O
to O
you H
. O

He O
will O
make O
sure O
that O
we H
do O
not O
request N
FX O
and O
inflation N
( O
CPI N
, O
PPI O
, O
etc. O
) O
curves O
when O
only O
one N
of O
the O
curves O
will O
actually O
be O
used O
in O
the O
valuation N
process N
and O
to O
determine O
which O
inflation N
index N
is O
needed O
. O

Typically O
, O
we H
receive O
both O
FX O
and O
inflation N
from O
you H
, O
but O
both O
curves O
may O
not O
always O
be O
used O
. O

I H
hope O
that O
we H
can O
give O
you H
some O
time N
savings N
by O
eliminating O
any O
nonessential O
requests N
. O

For O
now O
, O
this O
is O
the O
list N
of O
countries N
for O
which O
we H
will O
probably O
need O
the O
FX O
and O
/ O
or O
inflation N
curves O
. O

I H
will O
send O
the O
specifics N
per O
Andre H
later O
today N
. O

I H

) O

Panama O

Brazil O
we H
have O
current O
data N
already O

China O
we H
have O
current O
data N
already O

Euro O
inflation N
only O

I H
am O
not O
certain O
about O
the O
needs N
for O
the O
London O
Underwriting O
/ O
IV O
group N
but O
will O
request N
the O
information N
from O
them O
if O
you H
have O
not O
done O
so O
already O
. O

Thanks N

FYI O

Vince H

Anne H
, O
Mike H
will O
call O
you H
regarding O
Sarah H
. O

Vince H
, O

As O
I H
mentioned O
in O
my H
voice H
mail N
, O
Mike H
Roberts H
going O
to O
hire O
Sara H
Woody H
, O
a O
recent O
MBA N
grad H
from O
Rice N
, O
into O
his O
group N
. O

However O
, O
when O
we H
were O
talking O
about O
this O
position N
, O
Mike H
compared O
Sara H
to O
Elena H
. O

Elena's O
Elena H
's H
title N
is O
admin O
coordinator H
, O
and O
I H
know O
that O
Sara H
should O
not O
have O
this O
title N
, O
and O
honestly O
do O
not O
think O
that O
Elena H
should O
also O
. O

Admin O
coordinator's H
do O
primarily O
administrative O
work N
. O

I H
suggest O
that O
you H
compare O
Elena H
and O
Sarah's O
Sarah H
's H
duties N
/ O
level N
to O
other O
Sr. O
Spec. O
in O
your H
group N
such O
as O
Kenneth H
Parkhill O
and O
Sevil O
to O
determine O
if O
they O
are O
equivalent N
, O
or O
if O
their O
scope N
of O
responsibilities N
and O
experience N
is O
not O
as O
broad O
. O

If O
the O
latter N
is O
the O
case N
, O
we H
could O
place N
both O
Sara H
and O
Elena H
in O
a O
specialist H
job N
group N
( O
the O
salary N
range N
is O
33 O
- O
66 O
K O
) O
. O

Please O
advise O
. O

Thanks N
, O

Anne H

Clayton H

Thanks N

Thanks N
for O
putting O
the O
paperwork N

I H
would O
have O
interest N
in O
meeting N
if O
you H
can O
present N
unique O
investment N
opportunities N
that O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
access O
to O
now O
. O

Most O
of O
my H
contact O
with O
financial O
advisors H
in O
the O
past N
has O
consisted O
of O
them O
suggesting O
a O
mutual O
fund O
, O
telling O
me H
to O
invest O
in O
Home O
Depot O
, O
Sun O
, O
and O
Coke O
, O
or O
trying O
to O
pass O
off O
their O
banks' O
banks N
' O
biased O
research N
reports N
as O
something O
valuable O
. O

The O
above O
services N
provide O
no O
value N
to O
me H
personally O

If O
you H
can O
present N
opportunities N
such O
as O

to O
private O

or O
other O

We'll O
We H

At O
some O
point N

I'd O
I H
'd O
like O
to O
talk O
about O

over O

Appreciate O
the O

However O
, O
with O
my H
natural O
long O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
looking O
to O
really O
trade N

I H
believe O

in O

it O

I H

50 O

I H

to O
lighten O
up O
exposure N

will O
use O

I H
noticed O
I H

I H

John H

I H
was O
looking O
at O
the O

thinking O
it O
might O
be O
an O
opportunity N

buy O
back O
the O

you H
sold O

Of O

you H
would O
then O
be O
in O
a O

sell O

again O
if O
the O
stock N

I'm O
I H

pretty O
easy O

I H
know O
it O
seems O
like O
a O
stretch O
, O
but O
the O

I H
have O
a O
few O
entities N
that O
may O
need O
to O
change O
groups N
or O
be O
assigned O
to O
a O
group N
. O

18T O
- O
EI O
Indonesia O
Operations O
LLC O

This O
entity N
is O
not O
in O
TIS O
, O
SAP N
, O
nor O
Hyperion O
. O

The O
2000 O
tax N
return O
has O
no O
income N
, O
assets N
, O
or O
liabilities N
. O

There O
is O
a O
corporate O
data N
sheet N
for O
this O
company N
, O
but O
this O
entity N
seems O
to O
have O
been O
inactive O
since O
it's O
creation N
. O

86M O
- O
Enron O
Net O
Works N
LLC O

Despite O
the O
name N
, O
this O
entity N
appears O
to O
be O
a O
MTM O
company N
. O

Per O
September O
financials O
, O
this O
company N
has O
about O
$ O
3 O
M N
of O
MTM O
and O
about O
$ O
8 O
K O
of O
expenses N
, O
nothing N
else O
. O

The O
next O
5 O
companies N
were O
my H
responsibility N
while O
in O
EBS O
, O
and O
did O
not O
get O
assigned O
during O
the O
reorg O
. O

80Y O
- O
Enron O
Broadband O
Acquisition O
, O
Inc O
. O

This O
entity N
was O
created O
in O
2000 O
for O
the O
acquistion O
of O
WarpSpeed O
Communications O
( O
now O
Enron O
WarpSpeed O
Services N
, O
Inc. O
83N O
) O
, O
and O
then O
dissolved O
upon O
completion N
of O
merger N
. O

Company O
is O
around O
with O
a O
small O
amount N
of O
assets N
and O
liabilities N
, O
but O
no O
I/S O
items N
. O

83N O
is O
my H
responsibility N
. O

I H
think O
this O
entity N
should O
stay O
with O
83N O
. O

So O
I H
suggest O
it O
be O
assigned O
to O
Leon H
. O

It O
should O
be O
4 O

easy O
. O

1579 O
- O
EBS O
Network O

Division N
of O
17H O

This O
one N
should O
possibly O
be O
assigned O
to O
Networks O
& O
Services N
group N
. O

Not O
currently O
on O
our H
list N
of O
companies N
. O

I H
think O
this O
could O
go O
to O
either O
Holding N
/ O
Administrative O
Companies N
( O
Same O
as O
17H O
) O
or O

was O
assigned O
to O
Commodity N
and O
Trade N
( O
Todd H

so O
this O
one N

( O

Maybe O

Virginia H
, O

Hello O
. O

I H
was O
originally O
inquiring O
about O
purchasing O
a O
Cross O
or O
Signac O
impressionist O
lithograph N
. O

I H
found O
them O
and O
purchased O
both O
from O
a O
gallery N
in O
London O
, O
William H
Weston H
. O

They O
should O
be O
delivered O
this O
week N
. O

They O
are O
beautiful O
and O
will O
add O
a O
lot N
to O
our H
collection N
. O

By O
the O
way N
the O
Lichtenstein O
is O
up O
and O
hanging O
in O
our H
formal O
living O
room N
and O
it O
is O
magnificent O
. O

I H
have O
also O
purchased O
an O
Appel O
in O
the O
last O
month N
. O

I H
am O
interested O
in O
several O
artists H
. O

Actually O
, O
a O
lot N
. O

I H
will O
be O
looking O
for O
one N
or O
more O
of O
the O
following O
. O

My H
concept N
is O
that O
over O
time N
I H
would O
like O
to O
own O
one N
of O
all O
the O
following O
artists H
and O
they O
are O
all O
depending O
when O
I H
find O
something O
that O
we H
really O
like O
. O

I H
listed O
all O
of O
our H
( O
sometimes O
mine H
vs. O
my H
wife's O
wife H
's H
favorites N
and O
priorities N
) O
. O

They O
are O
kind N
of O
in O
rank N
order O
but O
as O
I H
stated O
if O
I H
find O
the O
piece N
that O
I H
like O
we H
will O
purchase N
it O
. O

I H
want O
signed O
and O
numbered O
. O

I H
realize O
that O
some O
were O
not O
signed O
by O
the O
artist H
but O
it O
is O
an O
important O
fact N
in O
my H
buying O
decision N
. O

I H
also O
realize O
that O
some O
may O
not O
have O
done O
any O
works O
on O
paper N
or O
they O
are O
outrageously O
expensive O
. O

For O
example N
, O
I H
would O
like O
to O
know O
if O
Rothko O
or O
Kline O
did O
any O
work N
on O
paper N
. O

At O
least O
that O
is O
what O
I H
am O
thinking O
now O
. O

Bonnard O
( O
colorful O
only O
) O

Lautrec O

Suerat O
( O
any O
works O
on O
paper N
? O
- O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
that O
he O
did O
any O
) O

Other O
impressionist O
or O
post N
impressionist O
lithos O

Braque O

Moore H

Arp O

Rouault O

Modrian O

Rothko O

Kline O

Motherwell O

By O
the O
way N
, O
I H
am O
interested O
in O
re-looking O
at O
a O
Picasso O
( O
although O
we H
have O
2 O
) O
that O
your H
gallery N
had O
a O
couple N
of O
years N
ago O
. O

It O
was O
a O
cubist O
piece N
from O
the O
1920s N
and O
I H
believe O
you H
called O
the O
technique N
a O
" O
push O
wa N
" O
( O
pronunciation N
Vs O
an O
attempt N
at O
the O
proper O
spelling O
) O
. O

It O
was O
for O
sale N
in O
a O
couple N
of O
galleries N
in O
SF O
and O
was O
about O
$ O
20,000 O
. O

Is O
there O
1 O
available O
? O

Also O
I H
am O
still O
thinking O
about O
the O
Matisse O
we H
discussed O
before O
but O
as O
you H
can O
see O
, O
I H
have O
a O
lot N
of O
other O
artists H
I H
am O
interested O
in O
and O
it O
may O
remain O
on O
the O

I H
have O
a O

I H
can O
wrap N
up O
the O
LOI O
: O

We H
refer O
to O

Fuel O
Cell N

equipment N

Do O
we H
intend O
to O
reference N
a O
particular O
manufacturer N
, O
or O
should O
this O
be O
more O
generic O
? O

Do O
we H
want O

attach O
a O
draft N
of O
the O
Development N
Agreement N
, O
and O
condition N
the O
final O
deal O
on O
agreeing O

the O

what's O
what O
's H
in O

I H
have O
a O
concern N
that O
the O
Enron O
optionality O
bug A
could O
bite N
us H
on O

with O
that O

Do O
we H

may O

Forget O
the O
ONE O
or O
more O
contract N
questions N

I H
see O
we H

of O

On O
the O
issue N
of O
the O
contracts N
, O
the O
draft N
says O
that O
the O
$ O
170 O
m O
is O
paid O
when O
the O
EPC O
contract N
is O
signed O
. O

Are O
we H
expecting O
that O
the O
portion N
attributable O
to O
each O
project N
will O
be O
paid O
as O
the O
individual O
EPC O
contracts N
are O
signed O
? O

Thanks N

1 O
. O
The O
pricing N
that O
we H
have O
given O
CRRA O
is O
specific O
to O
FuelCell O
Energy N
and O
would O
not O
be O
meaningful O
without O
listing O
the O
manufacturer N
( O
i.e. O
, O
ONSI O
would O
be O
a O
lot N
more O
money N
) O
. O

Hence O
, O
I H
think O
that O
we H
have O
to O
reference N
the O
manufacturer N
. O

2 O
. O
The O
attachment N
of O
the O
Development N
Agreement N
is O
a O
Jeff H
question N
. O

In O
order O
to O
mark N
any O
2000 O
income N
, O
we H
will O
need O
to O
get O
CRRA O
to O
execute O
the O
Development N
Agreement N
in O
2000 O
. O

In O
my H
opinion N
, O
we H
should O
show O
CRRA O
a O
copy N
of O
the O
LOI O
with O
the O
assumption N
that O
the O
Development N
Agreement N
is O
attached O
. O

I H
would O
actually O
send O
them O
the O
draft N
Development N
Agreement N
a O
couple N
days N
after O
the O
LOI O
. O

Based O
on O
how O
CRRA O
reacts O
, O
I H
would O
make O
an O
ultimate O
determination N
if O
the O
agreement N
needs N
to O
be O
attached O
to O
the O
LOI O
. O

3 O
. O
I H
expect O
at O
least O
one N
EPC O
contract N
per O
project N
. O

We H
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
condition N
the O
acceptance N
of O
one N
project N
on O
the O
performance N
of O
another O
project N
. O

Performance N
tests N
will O
either O
be O
performed O
on O
a O
project N
basis N
or O
a O
unit N
by O
unit N
basis N
in O
a O
given O
project N
. O

clear N
explanation N

Gentle O

I H
have O
pulled O
together O
a O
one N
page N
communication N
note N
on O
our H
fundamental O
operating O
standards N
( O
itself O
a O
one N
page N
summary N
) O
. O

We H
are O
in O
the O
final O
stages N
of O
this O
process N
- O
where O
we H
draft N
a O
cover O
letter N

which O
will O

this O

Have O
you H
any O

or O

note N
? O

Mike H

Late O
Jan H
sounds N
great O
. O

Meagan O
does O
have O
a O
couple N
of O
big O
things N
on O
the O
weekend N
in O
January O
-- O
National O
Charity O
League O
Senior O
Presentation O
( O
big O
dance O
that O
she O
and O
I H
are O
committed O
to O
help O
with O
) O
, O
the O
Bearkadette O
Ball O
and O
a O
winter N
party N
for O
Cotillion O
. O

I H
believe O
that O
these O
are O
three O
weekends N
in O
a O
row N
, O
January O
6 O
, O
13 O
and O
20th O
. O

So O
the O
last O
weekend N
in O
January O
would O
work N
well O
( O
and O
I H
will O
need O
a O
rest N
from O
formal O
affairs N
! O
) O
. O

Does O
that O
work N
for O
you H
? O

And O
do O
you H
want O
to O
do O
it O
on O
a O
Saturday O
or O
Sunday O
? O

Saturday O
probably O
works O
better O
for O
me H
, O
just O
so O
that O
I H
am O
back O
in O
Houston O
and O
doing O
laundry N
by O
Sunday O
afternoon N
!! O

Hi O
... O

Talked O
to O
the O
little O
mother H
- O
to O
- O
be O
. O

She O
said O
a O
shower N
would O
be O
grand O
. O

She O
has O
some O
big O
presentation N
mid-January O
. O

How O
does O
late O
January O
sound N
to O
you H
. O

Should O
we H
set O
a O
date N
now O
? O

Am O
I H
turning O
into O
Mother H
? O

Cindy H

I H
think O
that O
it O
is O
a O
great O
idea N
to O
get O
some O
press N
regarding O
our H
fundamental O
operating O
standards N
, O
but O
I H
wonder O
about O
the O
most O
appropriate O
timing N
, O
enough O
of O
a O
global O
message N
and O
the O
means N
of O
delivery N
. O

On O
the O
means N
of O
delivery N
, O
I H
am O
not O
sure O
from O
your H
note N
whether O
or O
not O
I H
fully O
understand O
the O
intent N
. O

Is O
there O
an O
article N
to O
be O
included O
in O
an O
Enron O
publication N
and O
in O
addition N
is O
a O
letter N
to O
be O
sent O
under O
John's O
John H
's H
name N
( O
if O
so O
, O
to O
whom O
will O
the O
letter N
be O
sent O
) O
? O

Or O
is O
the O
letter N
from O
John H
an O
introduction N
to O
be O
included O
as O
a O
lead O
in O
to O
the O
article N
? O

With O
regard N
to O
a O
global O
message N
, O
I H
think O
that O
one N
of O
the O
key N
points O
around O
fundamental O
operating O
standards N
are O
that O
they O
are O
intended O
to O
be O
global O
in O
nature N
, O
applied O
to O
every O
commodity N
and O
every O
location N
where O
we H
engage O
in O
trading N
activities N
. O

With O
these O
operating O
standards N
implemented O
worldwide O
, O
we H
will O
know O
as O
operations N
professionals H
that O
risk N
is O
being O
mitigated O
and O
we H
will O
be O
able O
to O
ensure O
Enron O
top N
management N
that O
there O
is O
consistency N
in O
operating O
standards N
worldwide O
. O

These O
global O
standards N
also O
should O
enable O
Enron O
to O
expand O
its O
business N
reach O
more O
quickly O
, O
with O
well O
defined O
requirements N
with O
regard N
to O
trading N
operations N
. O

I H
am O
not O
sure O
from O
the O
article N
as O
written O
that O
the O
global O
nature N
of O
this O
effort N
comes O
across O
. O

Finally O
, O
a O
question N
regarding O
timing N
. O

The O
last O
I H
knew O
after O
you H
and O
Brent H
drafted O
this O
starting O
point N
for O
fundamental O
operating O
standards N
was O
that O
this O
was O
being O
circulated O
( O
Shona O
took O
this O
to O
do O
after O
Brent's O
Brent H
's H
return O
to O
Houston O
) O
for O
comments N
to O
all O
business N
controllers H
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
believe O
that O
we H
are O
quite O
at O
the O
point N
that O
we H
can O
say O
that O
all O
business N
controllers H
worldwide O
have O
reviewed O
, O
understand O
and O
have O
implemented O
these O
standards N
. O

And O
not O
to O
belittle O
the O
process N
of O
creating O
the O
standards N
, O
the O
tough O
part N
( O
and O
the O
real O
meat N
behind O
this O
) O
will O
be O
an O
effective O
exception N
report N
on O
a O
global O
basis N
against O
these O
standards N
. O

My H
commitment N
to O
Rick H
Causey O
is O
that O
I H
will O
have O
that O
global O
report N
in O
production N
by O
the O
end N
of O
the O
year N
. O

There O
is O
much O
work N
to O
do O
in O
defining O
the O
content N
and O
regularity N
of O
the O
report N
and O
even O
more O
work N
to O
do O
to O
identify O
reliable O
sources N
of O
data N
for O
compiling O
the O
report N
. O

Shona O
has O
commissioned O
Mike H
Moscoso O
to O
work N
on O
this O
, O
and O
I H
believe O
that O
Mike H
has O
already O
been O
working O
with O
James H
New H
. O

So O
I H
question N
whether O
or O
not O
you H
want O
to O
publish O
info N
about O
fundamental O
standards N
that O
we H
can O
not O
yet O
report N
against O
. O

Would O
a O
more O
appropriate O
time N
be O
after O
the O
Global O
Operations O
Controller O
meeting N
in O
October O
when O
we H
should O
have O
worldwide O
buy O
- O
in O
and O
commitment N
to O
these O
standards N
and O
( O
hopefully O
) O
our H
first O
draft N
of O
a O
meaningful O
exception N
report N
? O

Sorry O
that O
this O
response N
looks O
so O
long O
. O

I H
have O
been O
interrupted O
20 O
times N
while O
responding O
, O
so O
I H
hope O
that O
it O
makes O
sense N
. O

Thanks N
for O
sharing N
this O
with O
me H
. O

Since O
you H
asked O
for O
input N
, O
I H
hope O
that O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
mind N
that O
I H
gave O
you H
some O
. O

Steve H
: O

At O
this O
point N
, O
our H
IT N
contacts N
are O
backpedalling O
a O
bit N
and O
suggesting O
they O
can O
overcome O
the O
TIBCO O
and O
Terminal O
Server H
problems N
. O

There O
are O
still O
four O
important O
issues N
, O
however O
: O

IT N
still O
cannot O
can O
not O
commit O
to O
transferring O
messages N
across O
domains N
. O

This O
means N
that O
messages N
initiated O
at O
Corp O
and O
intended O
for O
the O
entire O
Enron O
organization N
will O
not O
reach O
any O
business N
units N
outside O
the O
Corp O
domain N
. O

No O
messages N
will O
reach O
the O
EES N
organization N
unless O
IBM O
agrees O
not O
to O
use O
their O
proprietary O
message N
delivery N
tool N
, O
WebSphere O
, O
and O
will O
use O
WebLogic O
instead O
. O

WebLogic O
is O
required O
by O
BackWeb O
, O
although O
it O
is O
designed O
by O
a O
separate O
company N
. O

HR O
, O
intended O
to O
be O
a O
key N
user H
of O
this O
tool N
, O
will O
not O
use O
BackWeb O
because O
survey N
responses N
cannot O
can O
not O
be O
made O
anonymous O
. O

HR O
has O
already O
purchased O
a O
tool N
called O
CONFIRMIT O
that O
can O
execute O
anonymous O
surveys N
. O

Messages N
will O
not O
be O
delivered O
simultaneously O
to O
all O
users H
in O
the O
same O
domain N
, O
nor O
will O
they O
be O
delivered O
for O
two O
to O
five O
hours N
after O
they O
are O
sent O
by O
the O
message N
administrator H
. O

Another O
thing N
to O
consider O
is O
that O
these O
messages N
will O
be O
set O
to O
expire O
and O
disappear O
within O
a O
set O
period N
of O
time N
, O
meaning N
users H
cannot O
can O
not O
retrieve O
them O
and O
read O
them O
later O
( O
as O
they O
can O
with O
e-mail N
) O
. O

This O
means N
that O
I H
could O
be O
away O
from O
the O
office N
for O
several O
days N
and O
miss O
a O
message N
entirely O
, O
because O
it O
would O
have O
expired O
and O
disappeared O
by O
the O
time N
I H
returned O
. O

The O
plain O
fact N
is O
that O
a O
few O
members H
of O
IT N
are O
pushing O
this O
initiative N
, O
but O
they O
lack N
commercial O
sponsorship N
. O

They O
are O
hoping O
Corp O
will O
foot N
the O
bill N
for O
a O
pilot O
which O
will O
allow O
them O
to O
fully O
test N
this O
tool N
before O
implementing O
it O
company N

Barbara H
Walters H
did O
a O

She O
noted O

that O
women H
customarily O
walked O
about O
10 O
feet N
behind O
their O
husbands H
. O

She O
returned O
to O
Kuwait O
recently O
and O
observed O
that O
the O
men H
now O
walked O
several O
yards N
behind O
their O
wives H
. O

Ms. O
Walters H
approached O
one N
of O
the O
women H
and O
said O
, O
" O

do O
you H
think O
? O

Joe_Lardy@cargill.com O
on O
03/02/2001 O
10:39:03 O
AM O

Currently O
Cargill O
and O
Enron O
have O
a O
15 O
MM O
collateral O
threshold N
. O

If O
possible O
, O
I H
think O
the O
cleanest O
way N
to O
run O
this O
biz N
would O
be O
to O
put O
a O
box N
around O
the O
prime O
broker H
biz N
. O

We H
would O
still O
operate O
under O
the O
master O
isda O
but O
could O
set O
up O
a O
mutually O
agreeable O
credit N
support N
annex N
for O
this O
biz N
. O

We H
would O
still O
keep O
the O
20,000,000 O
line N
referenced O
in O
Schedule O
B O
of O
the O
POA A
agreement N
. O

The O
line N
in O
the O
POA A
is O
a O
seperate O
and O
distinct O
measure N
from O
the O
daily O
collateral O
. O

The O
20 O
mill N
reflects O
gross O
exposure N
. O

Let O
me H
know O
if O
you H
think O
this O
is O
reasonable O
and O
workable O
. O

We H
too O
, O
are O
open O
to O
suggestion N
as O
the O
Global O
and O
Enron O
relationships N
are O
very O
important O
and O
a O
high O
priority N
to O
us H
. O

Thanks N

a O
few O
things N

the O

I H
am O
going O
to O
find O
out O
how O
much O
line N
we H
currently O
have O
available O
... O
you H
probably O
already O
have O
this O
. O

We H
should O
allocate O
a O
piece N
to O
Global O
which O
would O
solve O
the O
problem N
of O
other O
Cargill O
people N
using O
the O
line N
, O
putting O
us H
over O
the O
limit O
, O
without O
me H
knowing O
... O

We H
could O
change O
the O
language N
of O
the O
POA A
to O
this O
... O

we H
will O
not O
go O
over O
Global's O
Global O
's H
piece N
of O
the O
Cargill O
line N
... O

I H
think O
this O
would O
solve O
our H
main O
concern N
... O

Please O
let O
me H
know O
... O
we H
are O
eager O
to O
keep O
trading N

Hello O
Janice H
: O

I H
enjoyed O
your H
recent O
e-mail N
but O
was O
sorry O
to O
hear O
about O
your H
dad H
. O

It O
sounds N
as O
though O
his O
health N
has O
deteriorated O
significantly O
. O

These O
are O
always O
difficult O
times N
. O

As O
I H
watched O
my H
mother H
and O
father's O
father H
's H
health N
deteriorate O
and O
ultimately O
watched O
them O
die O
, O
it O
is O
a O
very O
defining O
time N
in O
our H
lives O
. O

But O
we H
can O
be O
very O
thankful O
to O
have O
such O
great O
parents H
and O
to O
have O
had O
the O
privilege N
to O
have O
been O
raised O
in O
such O
loving O
homes N
. O

Sounds O
as O
though O
Eric H
has O
done O
very O
well O
as O
SMSU O
. O

He O
is O
joining O
an O
excellent O
company N
. O

I H
am O
also O
delighted O
to O
hear O
that O
he O
will O
continue O
his O
education N
working O
toward O
an O
MBA N
. O

As O
we H
are O
living O
in O
an O
age N
where O
intellectual O
capital N
is O
so O
valuable O
, O
it O
is O
important O
for O
every O
young O
person H
to O
obtain O
the O
very O
best O
possible O
education N
they O
can O
. O

As O
to O
our H
family H
, O
within O
the O
last O
ten O
days N
our H
youngest O
daughter H
Elizabeth H
was O
married O
to O
a O
young O
man H
from O
Buenos O
Aires O
, O
Argentina O
. O

They O
met O
while O
they O
were O
both O
working O
on O
a O
project N
as O
lawyers H
in O
Buenos O
Aires O
. O

They're O
They O
're O
currently O
on O
their O
honeymoon N
but O
shortly O
after O
returning O
will O
be O
moving O
from O
Buenos O
Aires O
to O
Miami O
, O
Florida O
. O

This O
past N
Thursday O
night N
our H
sixth O
grandchild H
was O
born O
. O

It O
was O
born O
to O
our H
son H
David H
and O
his O
wife H
Courtney H
. O

It O
was O
a O
7 O
lb. O
, O
10 O
oz. N
, O
20 O
inch N
little O
boy H
. O

So O
we H
now O
have O
three O
grandsons H
and O
three O
granddaughters H
ranging O
from O
about O
2 O
years N
- O
4 O
months N
down O
to O
a O
few O
days N
. O

They O
are O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
fun O
. O

We H
are O
doing O
quite O
well O
. O

I H
am O
looking O
forward O
to O
seeing O
Ginger H
" O
Rees H
" O
Copeland O
when O
she O
comes O
to O
Houston O
. O

I H
would O
be O
delighted O
to O
arrange O
tickets N
for O
you H
and O
your H
family H
should O
you H
ever O
have O
occasion N
to O
visit O
Houston O
. O

I H
hope O
you H
have O
a O
great O
summer N
. O

Thank O
you H
for O
your H
recent O
request N
for O
Mr. N
Lay H
to O
speak O
at O
your H

. O

Unfortunately O

it O

even O
greater O
progress N
in O
our H
public O

He O
also O
still O

the O

if O
we H

When O

the O
wedding N
? O

We're O
We H
're O
set O
for O
11/01/01 O

Be O
sure O
to O
take O
your H
sweety O
out O
on O
the O
balcony N
tonight N

gaze O
at O
the O
full O
moon N
. O

It O
was O
sure O
beautiful O
coming O
up O
last O
night N
. O

We H
used O
to O
go O
out O
and O
lay O
in O
the O
pasture N
on O
a O
blanket N
and O
watch O
for O
the O
space N
shuttle N
. O

I H
had O
a O
couple N
of O
hickies O
on O
my H
neck N
the O
day N
after O
and O
the O
guys H
all O
wanted O
to O
know O
if O
those O
were O
shuttle N
burns N
. O

Just O
jealous O
. O

My H
kid H
is O
making O
wonderful O
grades N
and O
has O
reassured O
me H
she O
will O
graduate H
within O
the O
four O
year N
period N
. O

She O
still O
has O
some O
sort N
of O
scholarship N
but O
I H
am O
not O
for O
sure O
how O
much O
it O
pays O
. O

She O
is O
going O
to O
be O
a O
kinesiologist O
, O
sports N
injury N
therapist H
. O

I H
think O
she O
just O
wants O
to O
be O
able O
to O
touch O
football N
players H
legs N
. O

She O
will O
be O
20 O
on O
11/03 O

I H
am O
really O
proud O
of O
her O
. O

Cindy H
said O
Jaime H

grown O
up O
very O
much O
. O

You H
should O
e O
mail N
her O
sometimes O
. O

I H
am O
sure O
she O
would O
like O
to O
hear O
from O
you H
. O

Jgerma5@aol.com O
. O

At O
any O
rate N
, O
be O
careful O

that O

in O
July O
and O
August O
of O

not O
invoiced O
. O

Hello O

I H
spoke O
with O
Jeff H
Hodge H
yesterday N
regarding O
the O
additional O
language N
from O
Peoples N
regarding O
Audit N
Rights N
. O

His O
initial O
reaction N
was O
that O
their O
request N
was O
probably O
reasonable O
and O
in O
line N
with O
the O
spirit N
of O
a O
jointly O
owned O
L.L.C O
. O

However O
, O
he O
did O
suggest O
a O
couple N
slight O
revisions N
to O
protect O
Enron's O
Enron O
's H
interests N
. O

that O
each O

an O

This O

been O

My H

It O
is O
less O
complicated O
for O
me H
to O
initial O
and O
fax N
than O
to O
track N
down O
someone H
who O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
know O
anything O
about O
it O
and O
get O
them O
to O
initial O
it O

I H
can O
print N
it O
here O
, O
initial O
it O
, O
and O
fax N
it O
to O
whomever O
you H
want O
. O

Plus O
, O
I H
work N
with O
Janet H
a O
lot N
so O
she O
may O
get O
some O
comfort O
from O
that O
, O
instead O
of O
having O
a O
lawyer H
she O
hasn't O
has O
n't O
dealt O
with O
initial O
it O
. O

She O
is O
very O
conscientious O
about O
what O
she O
signs N
, O
and O
who O
initials N
what O
. O

Is O
the O
attached O
form N
the O
final O
final O
form N
? O

Where O
and O
to O
whom O
do O
you H
want O
it O
faxed O
? O

Thanks N

Kay H

Since O
it O
will O
be O
Janet H
signing O
, O
it O
will O
probably O
be O
better O
to O
have O
the O
initials N
on O
the O
pages N
first O
. O

Either O
fax N
or O
someone H
else O
works O
fine O
. O

Let O
me H
know O
which O
is O
easier O
and O
we H
can O
coordinate O

Hello O
- O

I H
spoke O
with O
Jeff H
Hodge H
yesterday N
regarding O
the O
additional O
language N
from O
Peoples N
regarding O
Audit N
Rights N
. O

His O
initial O
reaction N
was O
that O
their O
request N
was O
probably O
reasonable O
and O
in O
line N
with O
the O
spirit N
of O
a O
jointly O
owned O
L.L.C O
. O

However O
, O
he O
did O
suggest O
a O
couple N
slight O
revisions N
to O
protect O
Enron's O
Enron O
's H
interests N
. O

1 O
) O
Highlighting O
that O
information N
will O
only O
be O
provided O
that O
is O
related O
to O
enovate O
and O
2 O
) O
that O
each O
designated O
representative O
should O
sign N
an O
appropriate O
confidentiality N
agreement N
. O

This O
language N
has O
been O
included O
in O
the O
attached O
draft N
. O

My H
goal N
, O
however O
optimistic O
, O
is O
to O
execute O
the O
risk N
policy N
by O
the O
end N
of O
today N
. O

Activity N
is O
picking O
up O
dramatically O
and O
the O
fine O
line N
is O
getting O
further O
blurred O
each O
passing O
day N
. O

Therefore O
, O
I H
need O
to O
know O
ASAP O
if O
there O
are O
any O
problems N
with O
the O
draft N
as O
written O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
I H
will O
be O

Kay H

It O
was O
good O
to O
hear O
from O
you H
! O

We H
had O
a O
nice O
Thanksgiving O
here O
too O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
funny O
, O
because O
usually O
it's O
it O
's H
just O
me H
, O
Mom H
, O
Craig H
and O
Danelia O
, O
and O
Danelia O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
really O
like O
roasted O
turkey A
or O
roast O
beef N
( O
not O
that O
she O
would O
say O
it O
to O
me H
! O
) O
, O
so O
there O
is O
not O
just O
the O
same O
joy N
in O
cooking O
it O
would O
be O
elsewise O
. O

It O
was O
good O
having O
the O
girls H
down O
. O

We H
played O
a O
new O
version N
of O
Uno O
called O
" O
African O
Uno O
" O
that O
was O
complex O
, O
fast O
and O
at O
times N
, O
physically O
challenging O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
not O
for O
the O
meek O
. O

It O
was O
incredible O
what O
a O
good O
player H
Alena O
was O
. O

She O
had O
her O
cards N
memorized O
as O
well O
as O
everyone O
elses O
else O
s O
( O
when O
you H
play O
you'll O
you H
'll O
see O
why O
you H
can O
know O
everyone O
elses O
else O
s O
hands N
! O
) O
. O

I H
expect O
Craig H
didn't O
did O
n't O
want O
Mom H
to O
see O
his O
place N
because O
it O
was O
messy O
. O

I H
think O
compared O
to O
my H
house N
, O
he's O
he O
's H
embarrased O
about O
his O
apartment N
. O

Then O
, O
also O
, O
he's O
he O
's H
got O
so O
much O
stuff N
in O
there O
right O
now O
, O
that O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
he's O
he O
's H
going O
to O
fit O
baby H
stuff N
. O

They O
would O
only O
give O
him O
a O
6 O
month N
lease N
when O
he O
renewed O
his O
lease N
last O
month N
because O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
3 O
people N
in O
that O
small O
apartment N
. O

So O
he's O
he O
's H
going O
to O
have O
to O
start O
looking O
for O
another O
place N
. O

And O
his O
apartment N
is O
so O
run O
down O
down O
I'm O
I H
'm O
afraid O
roaches A
might O
be O
crawling O
over O
the O
baby H
. O

I H
guess O
Mom H
is O
going O
to O
come O
back O
down O
sometime O
in O
March O
or O
April O
to O
see O
the O
new O
baby H
. O

You'll O
You H
'll O
have O
to O
come O
visit O
to O
check O
out O
my H
new O
house N
. O

The O
upstairs O
" O
guest H
suite N
" O
is O
pretty O
neat O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
got O
its O
own O
bathroom N
and O
tv N
, O
and O
is O
pretty O
cozy O
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
call O
with O
Uncle H
Ben H
goes O
, O
if O
he O
was O
thrilled O
to O
hear O
from O
me H
I H
couldn't O
could O
n't O
tell O
by O
his O
voice H
. O

It O
was O
a O
pretty O
stilted O
conversation N
for O
both O
of O
us H
. O

But O
, O
I H
guess O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
a O
start O
... O

I've O
I H
've O
already O
made O
my H
XMAS O
plans N
. O

I H
leave O
the O
evening N
of O
the O
21st O
, O
my H
flight N
comes O
in O
about O
10 O
pm O
, O
and O
leave O
the O
morning N

the O
27th O

It O

Russell H

Hey O
there O
yourself H
, O

Sorry O
I H
haven't O
have O
n't O
written O
you H
guys H
in O
a O
while O
to O
keep O
you H
properly O
updated O
. O

I H
am O
indeed O
checking O
on O
flights N
to O
Seoul O
and O
don't O
do O
n't O
think O
I'm O
I H
'm O
going O
to O
go O
at O
exactly O
the O
same O
time N
as O
my H
parents H
. O

As O
much O
fun O
as O
they O
are O
, O
I H
figured O
we H
would O
probably O
do O
some O
different O
things N
than O
what O
you H
have O
planned O
for O
them O
. O

As O
for O
Ted H
, O
things N
are O
still O
going O
well O
although O
I H
haven't O
have O
n't O
see O
him O
at O
all O
this O
week N
( O
we H
are O
two O
very O
busy O
people N
) O
. O

But O
, O
we H
had O
a O
great O
laid O
back O
day N
last O
Saturday O
and O
I H
think O
have O
hit O
that O
comfortable O
stage N
... O
you H
know O
, O
not O
quite O
so O
formal O
about O
dates O
etc O
. O

In O
one N
sense N
it's O
it O
's H
great O
, O
but O
it O
also O
makes O
things N
a O
lot N
harder O
to O
read O
. O

Anyway O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
sure O
my H
Mom H
told O
you H
guys H
but O
Travis H
and O
Kathy H
got O
to O
meet O
him O
and O
I H
think O
it O
went O
well O
. O

Hopefully O
, O
if O
we're O
we H
're O
still O
dating O
come O
December O
, O
you H
and O
Chuck H
can O
meet O
him O
when O
you H
come O
back O
to O
visit O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
planning O
on O
dragging O
him O
to O
at O
least O
one N
of O
the O
U.T. O
games N
, O
I H
just O
have O
to O
find O
out O
when O
he O
wants O
to O
go O
( O
as O
well O
as O
properly O
prepare O
him O
for O
the O
Scott H
/ O
Kelley O
/ O
Parks O
/ O
Wild O
Card O
gang N
and O
the O
full O
- O
day N
affair N
that O
is O
a O
U.T. O
game N
) O
. O

Things N
in O
Houston O
are O
good O
and O
definitely O
warm O
. O

I H
went O
with O
Emily H
and O
her O
Mom H
last O
night N
to O
see O
the O
musical N
" O
Rent O
" O
and O
it O
was O
wonderful O
. O

Also O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
going O
out O
to O
San O
Diego O
for O
the O
Labor N
Day O
weekend N
to O
visit O
Hoot's O
Hoot O
's H
daughter H
Julie H
. O

Needless O
to O
say O
I H
am O
very O
excited O
. O

Talk O
to O
you H
guys H
soon O
, O

Susan H

Hey O
girlie O
, O

How O
are O
you H
doing O
? O

Haven't O
Have O
n't O
heard O
from O
you H
in O
a O
while O
. O

A H
little O
birdie N
told O
me H
that O
you H
were O
checking O
into O
tickets N
for O
Seoul O
. O

Are O
you H
really O
? O

Would O
you H
come O
with O
your H
parents H
or O
separately O
? O

In O
any O
case N
, O
we H
have O
had O
some O
more O
time N
to O
do O
some O
exploring O
( O
and O
shopping O
) O
, O
so O
we H
have O
some O
good O
ideas N
about O
what O
to O
do O
if O
you H
come O
. O

I H
think O
that O
we H
will O
stay O
in O
Korea O
when O
your H
parents H
come O
and O
do O
the O
whole O
base N
thing N
( O
which O
will O
take O
only O
a O
few O
minutes N
, O
actually O
) O
, O
but O
are O
considering O
going O
to O
China O
or O
somewhere O
during O
part N
of O
Thanksgiving O
. O

We'll O
We H
'll O
do O
whatever O
you H
want O
want O
if O
you H
still O
are O
coming O
! O

Let O
us H
know O
the O
latest O
with O
Ted H
and O
also O
with O
what's O
what O
's H
going O
on O
in O
Houston O
. O

Take O
care N

, O
side N
- O
kick N
to O
the O
Lone O
Ranger H
or O
in O
this O
case N
the O
Big O
D H
) O

The O
play O
was O
very O
good O
and O
I H
think O
well O
received O
. O

I'd O
I H
'd O
forgotten O
how O
blown O
away O
I H
was O
by O
some O
of O
the O
songs N
the O
first O
time N
I H
saw O
it O
in O
NY O
. O

The O
cast N
members H
really O
have O
to O
have O
incredibly O
powerful O
voices N
to O
pull O
off O
a O
few O
of O
the O
most O
poignant O
numbers N
( O
I H
think O
this O
could O
be O
your H
true O
calling O
) O
. O

I H
caught O
the O
third O
day N
of O
Corey's O
Corey H
's H
Jeopardy O
run O
last O
night N
here O
at O
the O
office N
( O
yes O
, O
I H
had O
to O
come O
back O
after O
the O
play O
... O
I H
love O
my H
job N
! O
) O
. O

Anyway O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
sure O
I'd O
I H
'd O
mentioned O
it O
before O
but O
yes O
she O
is O
a O
very O
smart O
girl H
. O

As O
a O
result N
of O
that O
, O
she O
has O
managed O
on O
several O
occasions N
over O
the O
years N
to O
detract O
from O
my H
enjoyment N
of O
playing O
Trivial O
Pursuit O
or O
watching O
Jeopardy O
by O
absolutely O
obliterating O
me H
( O
The O
girl H
actually O
did O
her O
senior H
thesis N
on O
Trivia N
) O
. O

Kori O
told O
me H
she O
saw O
you H
last O
night N
at O
Steak N
Night N
and O
introduced O
herself O
since O
I H
failed O
to O
do O
so O
the O
last O
time N
we H
went O
. O

I H
should O
let O
you H
know O
though O
that O
she O
was O
very O
offended O
this O
morning N
that O
you H
didn't O
did O
n't O
spell O
her O
name N
right O
in O
the O
email N
- O
I H
mean O
it's O
it O
's H
such O
a O
common O
spelling O
. O

So O
was O
Darren H
there O
last O
night N
to O
meet O
her O
or O
do O
you H
just O
think O
they'd O
they O
'd O
make O
a O
good O
match O
? O

She's O
She O
's H
a O
very O
fun O
girl H
. O

Hope O
you H
day N
is O
going O
well O
and O
that O
the O
move O
to O
30 O
went O
off O
without O
a O
hitch N
. O

Good O
luck N
with O
all O
of O
the O
" O
fun O
" O
meetings N
. O

Shorty O

-- O
Due O
to O
the O
lack N
of O
response N
yesterday N
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
beginning O
to O
worry O
about O
your H
success N
with O
the O
road N
test N
... O

I'm O
I H
'm O
going O
to O
assume O
that O
you H
didn't O
did O
n't O
get O
around O
to O
it O
. O

How O
was O
the O
play O
? O

I H
forgot O
to O
tell O
you H
that O
I H
saw O
your H
friend H
on O
a O
re-run O
Jeopardy O
the O
other O
night N
and O
I H
almost O
called O
you H
but O
it O
came O
on O
at O
11:30 O
. O

Smart O
girl H
. O

I H
ran O
into O
Corey H
last O
night N
at O
LWs O
LW O
s O
and O
I H
am O
thinking O
this O
is O
a O
girl H
for O
Darren H
. O

Anyway O
, O
lots N
of O
fun O
meetings N
today N
. O

I'll O
I H
'll O
talk O
to O
you H
later O
. O

Maybe O
you H
should O
ignore O
the O
sentiment N
of O
the O
quote N
I H
sent O
earlier O
... O

I H
think O
you H
may O
be O
adhering O
to O
it O
too O
faithfully O
. O

At O
this O
rate N
we H
may O
have O
to O
start O
pinning O
notes N
to O
your H
shirt N
to O
remind O
you H
to O
do O
things N
. O

However O
, O
having O
driven O
with O
you H
on O
several O
occasions N
I H
feel O
confident O
you H
will O
be O
able O
to O
pass O
the O
test N
with O
flying O
colors N
. O

Keep O
in O
mind N
though O
that O
if O
you H
end N
up O
failing O
I H
will O
not O
let O
you H
forget O
it O
( O
and O
, O
as O
we H
have O
established O
, O
I H
have O
the O
memory N
of O
an O
elephant A
) O
. O

I'll O
I H
'll O
keep O
discussion N
of O
me H
to O
a O
minimum O
and O
just O
say O
that O
things N
are O
well O
on O
32 O
. O

Now O
back O
to O
what's O
what O
's H
really O
important O
... O
you H
. O

Thought O
you'd O
you H
'd O
like O
to O
know O
that O
the O
Dixie O
Chicks A
are O
coming O
back O
to O
Houston O
Dec. O
12 O
and O
will O
performing N
just O
down O
the O
street N
from O
you H
at O
the O
Compaq O
Center O
... O
it's O
it O
's H
all O
about O
you H
and O
your H
needs N

I H

take O

There O
is O
no O
pleasure N

I H

it's O
it O

a O

Travis H
is O
the O

lawyer H
who O
has O
taken O

he O

better O

Hi O
everyone O
, O

I H
just O
got O
of O
the O
phone N
with O
Hai H
and O
he O
told O
me H
how O
to O
make O
an O
adjustment N
on O
a O
day N
to O
day N
basis N
in O
regards O
to O
incorrect O
liquidations N
but O
he O
also O
explained O
this O
is O
just O
to O
make O
the O
daily O
P&L O
#'s O
right O
, O
if O
nothing N
were O
done O
the O
month N
end N
P&L O
would O
still O
somehow O
work N
out O
because O
adjustments N
would O
be O
made O
. O

Does O
this O
mean O
that O
for O
June O
and O
for O
a O
certain O
portion N
of O
July O
we H
should O
not O
do O
anything O
and O
just O
make O
adjustments N
on O
a O
going O
forward O
basis N
( O
and O
assume O
everything O
will O
work N
out O
at O
month N
end N
) O
? O

If O
this O
is O
the O
case N
I H
would O
like O
someone H
to O
walk O
me H
through O
June O
to O
see O
if O
the O
numbers N
did O
really O
work N
themselves O
out O
as O
there O
was O
a O
large O
swing O
in O
second N
order O
on O
June O
29 O
that O
was O
not O
adjusted O
for O
. O

Let O
me H
know O
if O
one N
of O
you H
could O
help O
me H
do O
this O
. O

As O
we H
discussed O
yesterday N
, O
Laird O
and O
I H
spoke O
and O
we H
think O
that O
the O
presentation N
is O
good O
to O
go O
for O
Thursday O
. O

We'll O
We H
'll O
need O
to O
update O
the O
numbers N
for O
the O
offer O
we H
made O
to O
S.D. O
last O
week N
. O

You H
had O
mentioned O
that O
you H
might O
want O
to O
include O
a O
shaped O
product N
. O

You H
still O
considering O
it O
? O

Let O
us H
know O
and O
we H
can O
add O
it O
, O
and O
make O
any O
other O
changes N
you'd O
you H
'd O
like O
to O
make O
at O
this O
end N
. O

My H
flight N
gets O
into O
S.D. O
at O
at O
8:35 O
on O
southwest O
. O

Best O

it's O
it O

actually O
happening O
at O
10 O
AM O
and O
it's O
it O

renewable O

Dear O
Justin H

Marly O
asked O
me H
to O
respond O
to O
you H
. O

As O
you H
know O
, O
the O
suffix N
ONLINE O
is O
purely O
descriptive O
and O
now O
used O
by O
many O
companies N
. O

Therefore O
, O
any O
trade N
mark N
registration N
that O
incorporates O
the O
word N
ONLINE O
as O
a O
suffix N
in O
the O
way N
that O
you H
use O
it O
will O
not O
enable O
its O
owner H
to O
prevent O
others O
from O
using O
the O
word N
ONLINE O
. O

Given O
the O
above O
, O
if O
you H
have O
adequate O
protection N
for O
the O
word N
ENRON O
( O
which O
covers O
the O
services N
that O
you H
offer O
on O
- O
line N
as O
well O
as O
your H
core N
activities N
) O
, O
I'd O
I H
'd O
say O
that O
another O
application N
for O
the O
words N
ENRON O
ONLINE O
is O
probably O
unnecessary O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you H
use O
a O
particular O
logo N
for O
the O
on O
- O
line N
service N
, O
that O
should O
be O
registered O
. O

I H
hope O
the O
above O
is O
clear N
. O

If O
you H

on O
this O
request N

Can O
one N

give O

Thanks N

I H
believe O
we H
are O
to O
some O
extent N
already O
protected O
with O

Enron O
" O
proceeded O
with O
anything O
, O
but O
EnronOnline O
( O
TM N
) O
, O

just O
affords O
us H
more O
protection N

I H
assume O
this O

akin O
to O
why O

Paul H

Can O
you H
please O
give O
me H
a O
call O
to O
discuss O
trademarking O
? O

i.e. O
Are O
we H
covered O
if O
we H
proceed O
a O
word N
with O
" O
Enron O
" O
? O

e.g. O
: O

If O
we H
are O

then O
was O
it O
necessary O

Perhaps O
you H

We H

the O
amendment N

Gas N
ISDA O
Master O
executed O
by O
BC O
Gas N
, O
which O
adds O
the O
Canadian O

so O
we H
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
add O
the O

. O

BC O
Gas N
won't O
wo O
n't O
sign N
the O

with O
the O
rep H
in O

and O
this O
has O
caused O
much O
difficulties N

I H
am O
going O
to O
count O
it O

since O

we H
still O
need O
it O

It O

Tom H
had O
the O

you H
probably O
didn't O
did O
n't O
see O

I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
either O

he O
said O
that O
his O
current O
understanding N
is O
that O
all O
of O
the O

will O
be O
done O
out O
of O
London O
. O

I H
communicated O
that O
to O

Though O
I H

I H
am O
still O
determined O

attend O
The O

next O

I H
understand O
how O
competitive O
the O

become O
, O
but O
I H
felt N
that O
with O
my H
work N

, O
personality N
, O

activities N
, O
etc. O
that O
this O
would O
compensate O

After O
talking O
with O

, O

I H
was O
sure O
that O

I H

so O
I H
want O
you H

know O
that O
I H
am O
going O
to O
do O
whatever O
it O
takes O
to O
get O
in O
next O

I H
plan N

taking O
two O
or O
three O

this O

I H
also O
plan N

retaking O
the O

Due O
to O
my H

this O
will O
be O
a O
monumental O
task N

but O
I H
am O
determined O
to O

to O
the O
Committee N
that O
I H

be O
successful O
at O

, O
that O

would O

After O

Due O

I H

I H
would O
like O
to O
thank O
you H
for O
taking O
the O
time N
to O
recommend O
me H
to O
the O
MBA N
Program N
. O

In O
the O
end N
, O
the O
results N
were O
not O
favorable O
. O

I H
understand O
that O
it O
is O
a O
competitive O
process N
, O
but O
I H
felt N
that O
with O
my H
work N
experiences N
, O
recommendations N
, O
extrcurricular O
activities N
, O
etc. O
, O
that O
this O
would O
help O
my H
chances N
and O
possibly O
compensate O
my H
disability N
. O

After O
talking O
with O
you H
and O
Professors O
Ronn O
, O
Brown H
and O
Jemison O
, O
I H
was O
sure O
that O
UT O
was O
the O
right O
place N
to O
continue O
learning O
about O
energy N
- O
finance O
. O

I H
am O
still O
sure O
that O
UT O
is O
the O
place N
for O
getting O
an O
excellent O
graduate H
- O
level N
education N
, O
so O
I H
want O
you H
to O
know O
that O
I H
am O
going O
to O
do O
what O
ever O
it O
takes O
to O
get O
in O
next O
year N
. O

I H
plan N
on O
taking O
a O
couple N
of O
graduate H
level N
finance O
courses N
at O
the O
University N
of O
Houston O
this O
Summer N
and O
Fall N
to O
demonstrate O
to O
the O
Admissions N
office N
that O
I H
can O
compete O
at O
this O
level N
. O

I H
also O
plan N
on O
trying O
to O
retake O
the O
GMAT O
test N
. O

Due O
to O
my H
disability N
, O
this O
will O
be O
a O
monumental O
task N
, O
but O
I H
am O
determined O
to O
prove O
to O
the O
Admissions N
committment O
that O
I H
can O
do O
the O
work N
at O
The O
Texas O
University N
Graduate O
School N
of O
Business N
. O

Also O
, O
I H
would O
like O
to O
continue O
our H
dialague O
regarding O
creating O
an O
Energy N
- O
Finance N
Private O
Equity N
Fund N
at O
UT O
. O

I H
know O
that O
with O
my H
industry N
- O
wide O
and O
investment N
banking N
contacts N
that O
I H
can O
help O
raise O
capital N
for O
the O
fund O
. O

I H
am O
very O
interested O
in O
energy N
- O
finance O
and O
think O
that O
your H
idea N
is O
a O
very O
good O
. O

Thanks N
again O
for O
taking O
the O
time N
to O
listen O
and O
talk O
with O
me H
. O

It O
has O
been O
a O
pleasure N
to O
meet O

you H
and O
I H
hope O

can O
continue O
to O

Yvan O

please O

Thank O

Furthermore O
, O
I H
would O
like O
to O
reiterate O
that O
RAC's O
RAC O
's H
goal N
, O
prior O
to O
quoting O
any O
credit N
reserve O
, O
is O
to O
be O
100 O
% O
confident O
that O
: O
( O
i H
) O
the O
methodology N
that O
is O
being O
employed O
is O
consistent O
among O
the O
internal O
groups N
; O
and O
( O
ii O
) O
the O
inherent O
value N
of O
the O
price N
risk N
management N
contracts N
matches O
. O

This O
enables O
RAC O
to O
manage O
the O
associated O
risk N
during O
the O
life N
of O
the O
transaction N
both O
effectively O
and O
appropriately O
. O

Article N
6 O
of O
the O
Gallup O
Compression O
Services N
Agreement N
( O
which O
I H
am O
sending O
to O
you H
separately O
) O
with O
ECS O
obligates O
ECS O
to O
" O
work N
in O
good O
faith N
with O
CDEC O
" O
to O
establish O
an O
automated O
system N
that O
would O
automatically O
have O
alerted O
us H
to O
peak N
loading O
conditions N
on O
CDEC's O
CDEC O
's H
system N
. O

We H
had O
a O
pretty O
good O
idea N
when O
we H
signed O
the O
contract N
that O
ECS O
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
complete O
that O
by O
the O
contract N
start O
date N
, O
so O
we H
negotiated O
a O
fall N
back O
plan N
under O
which O
ECS O
is O
obligated O
to O
" O
assist O
[ O
Transwestern O
] O
in O
developing O
a O
manual N
system N
to O
accomplish O
the O
same O
result N
and O
will O
hold O
harmless O
and O
keep O
[ O
Transwestern O
] O
whole O
for O
all O
cost O
and O
expenses N
" O
associated O
with O
the O
manual N
system N
. O

We H
will O
fight N
with O
them O
about O
who O
owes O
the O
$ O
200 O
k O
that O
James H
mentions O
below O
based O
on O
their O
failure N
to O
" O
assist O
" O
us H
in O
managing O
the O
cost O
. O

In O
the O
mean O
time N
, O
we H
need O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
we H
are O
doing O
everything O
we H
can O
to O
get O
a O
handle N
on O
the O
situation N
to O
mitigate O
future N
costs O
. O

Do O
we H
have O
someone H
who O
is O
watching O
this O
out O
there O
? O

We H
are O
running O
so O
full O
tilt O
on O
TW O
that O
we H
may O
not O
have O
as O
much O
flexibiltiy N
to O
manage O
this O
situation N
as O
we H
expected O
, O
but O
let O
me H
know O
what O
we H
can O
do O
. O

James H
had O
heard O
that O
one N
hold O
up O
was O
the O
absence N
of O
a O
confidentiality N
agreement N
-- O
I H
guess O
between O
ECS O
and O
Transwestern O
-- O
that O
would O
permit N
ECS O
to O
communicate O
to O
us H
the O
details N
on O
how O
to O
access O
teh O
key N
info. O
from O
CDEC O
. O

That O
sounds N
like O
a O
BS N
excuse O
from O
ECS O
, O
but O
it O
that's O
that O
's H
what O
they O
are O
saying O
, O
let O
me H
know O
and O
we H
can O
figure O
out O
a O
solution N
. O

Would O
you H
please O
contact O
Gerald H
Nemec O
and O
review N
the O
Gallup O
Compression O
Service O
Contract O
in O
respect N
to O
the O
Load N
Control O
Management O
. O

My H
understanding N
was O
that O
ECS O
was O
to O
provide O
a O
means N
to O
access O
CDEC's O
CDEC O
's H
online O
profile N
in O
order O
for O
us H
to O
make O
a O
decision N
to O
avoid O
running O
the O
compressor N
during O
CDEC's O
CDEC O
's H
peak N
load N
periods N
. O

We H
have O
not O
received O
access O
to O
this O
information N
which O
has O
resulted O
so O
far O
in O
additional O
electric O
cost O
of O
$ O
200,987.33 O
for O
the O
period N
of O
July O
through O
September O
. O

Additional O
cost O
will O
be O
incurred O
for O
the O
remainder N
of O
this O
year N
, O
that O
I H
have O
not O
been O
able O
to O
review N
yet O
. O

This O
cost O
is O
averaging O
$ O
79,000 O
per O
month N
if O
we H
continue O
to O
run O
the O
compressor N
as O
we H
have O
in O
August O
and O
September O
. O

Good O
point N
, O
but O
I'm O
I H
'm O
comfortable O
we're O
we H
're O
covered O
because O
our H
bidders H
were O
all O
bidding N
on O
a O
chunk N
of O
capacity N
and O
primary O
points O
. O

They O
are O
deemed O
to O
be O
on O
notice O
that O
they O
had O
alternate O
point N
rights N
( O
its O
it O
s H
in O
the O
tariff N
) O
and O
if O
they O
wanted O
to O
submit O
a O
bid N
that O
had O
a O
different O
rate N
for O
primaries N
and O
alternates H
, O
they O
could O
have O
done O
so O
. O

None O
of O
them O
did O
, O
and O
most O
importantly O
, O
the O
winning O
bidders H
did O
not O
. O

Our H
letter N
agreement N
simply O
memorializes O
that O
we H
will O
charge O
the O
same O
negotiated O
rate N
whether O
the O
gas N
flows N
on O
primaries N
or O
alternates H
. O

I H
assume O
from O
your H
message N
you H
are O
OK O
with O
this O
and O
they O
can O
get O
it O
nailed O
down O
? O

DF O

I H
just O
got O
done O
looking O
at O
the O
underlying O
contract N
language N
as O
set O
forth O
in O
the O
pro O
forma O
service N
agreement N
in O
the O
tariff N
and O
it O
specifically O
says O
that O
the O
max N
rate N
would O
apply O
unless O
a O
discount N
or O
negotiated O
rate N
has O
been O
agreed O
to O
. O

My H
concern N
with O
adding O
the O
language N
below O
is O
, O
could O
it O
be O
argued O
that O
not O
everyone O
knew O
the O
rate N
would O
or O
could O
apply O
at O
any O
point N
, O
since O
we H
just O
stated O
Topack O
and O
Needles O
and O
if O
they O
knew O
they O
might O
have O
bid N
a O
different O
rate N
?? O

chair N
, O
but O
we H
rarely O
, O
if O
ever O
, O
have O
a O
surplus O
because O
they O
are O
so O
popular O
. O

The O
cost O
is O
$ O
567.77 O
per O
chair N
plus O
tax N

Please O
approve O
the O
purchase N
of O
two O

Thanks N
! O

I H
believe O
you H
got O
a O
copy N
of O
the O
John H
Sommer O
letter N
to O
producers H
dated O
Jan H
6 O
that O
MKM's O
MKM O
's H
spies H
intercepted O
. O

She O
forwarded O
the O
Sommer O
letter N
to O
Stan H
and O
discussed O
it O
with O
him O
. O

Dari O
and O
I H
vented O
our H
aggravation N
by O
drafting O
the O
attached O
letter N
to O
Gibson H
and O
Kyle H
complaining O
of O
Sommer's O
Sommer O
's H
duplicity N
, O
but O
after O
tempers N
cooled O
, O
MKM O
and O
I H
decided O
not O
to O
send O
it O
to O
Stan H
or O
urge N
him O
to O
send O
a O
written O
response N
. O

As O
it O
stands O
, O
MKM O
and O
I H
will O
probably O
bring O
it O
up O
with O
Sommer O
in O
OK O
City N
and O
strongly O
suggest O
the O
importance N
of O
coordinated O
communication N
to O
the O
producers H
. O

Stan H
may O
also O
bring O
the O
letter N
up O
orally O
next O
time N
he's O
he O
's H
on O
the O
phonne O
with O
Gibson H
or O
Kyle H
as O
an O
example N
of O
how O
not O
to O
handle N
this O
situation N
. O

Yea O
-- O
it O
was O
outstanding O
news N
! O

What O
a O
hoss N
. O

Can't O
Ca O
n't O
catch O
you H
this O
time N
but O
14721 O
keep O
me H
posted O
on O
your H
next O
trip N

Jean O
& O
Thane O
-- O

Can O
we H
have O
a O
meeting N
this O
week N
( O
maybe O
Thursday O
at O
3:30 O
) O
to O
discuss O
this O
? O

Jim H

We H
do O
need O
a O
formal O
plan N
. O

We H
have O
been O
working O
closely O
together O
to O
identify O
the O
issues N
as O
they O
develop O
and O
propose O
solutions N
. O

Doug H
has O
been O
providing O
us H
with O
the O
necessary O
specific O
market N
information N
. O

We H
have O
been O
successful O
in O
communicating O
that O
information N
to O
the O
new O
commissioners H
and O
Ercot O
and O
seeking O
resolution N
. O

The O
commission N
is O
definitely O
more O
responsive O
to O
market N
participants H
that O
are O
articulating O
the O
issue N
, O
providing O
specific O
examples N
and O
proposing O
the O
solution N
. O

Grand O
- O
standing N
is O
ignored O
. O

Those O
who O
show O
up O
with O
complaints N
but O
cannot O
can O
not O
point N
to O
specifics N
are O
virtually O
ignored O
. O

Those O
who O
show O
up O
and O
complain O
, O
but O
are O
not O
participating O
in O
the O
working O
groups N
and O
the O
daily O
Ercot O
phone N
calls O
, O
board N
meetings N
, O
etc. O
are O
ignored O
. O

Doug H
and O
I H
met O
with O
the O
Chairman O
of O
PUCT O
and O
have O
had O
subsequent O
conversations N
. O

Thane O
and O
I H
also O
visited O
with O
him O
. O

Pat H
Wood H
made O
a O
phone N
call O
to O
Tom H
Noel H
and O
told O
him O
to O
get O
the O
Texas O
market N
fixed O
. O

( O
Even O
though O
he O
has O
bigger O
things N
to O
do O
in O
D.C. O
, O
this O
is O
his O
legacy N
and O
he O
recognizes O
that O
if O
deregulation N
does O
not O
work N
in O
Texas O
, O
the O
repercussions N
could O
be O
global O
. O
) O

Chairman O
Sibley O
and O
Chairman O
Wolens O
( O
of O
the O
Texas O
legislature N
) O
are O
also O
engaged O
in O
market N
developments N
. O

We H
have O
been O
working O
with O
the O
State N
Affairs N
legislative O
committee N
and O
keeping N
them O
apprised O
. O

There O
is O
an O
Electric O
Restructuring O
Committee N
hearing O
scheduled O
for O
September O
6th O
or O
7th O
. O

The O
forum N
is O
expected O
to O
be O
invited O
testimony N
only O
. O

Those O
currently O
listed O
as O
invitees H
are O
PUCT O
Commissioners H
and O
Ercot's O
Ercot O
's H
Sam H
Jones H
and O
Tom H
Noel H
. O

The O
hearing O
is O
focused O
on O
the O
pilot O
and O
we H
have O
an O
opportunity N
to O
provide O
some O
probing O
questions N
for O
Wolens O
to O
direct O
to O
Sam H
and O
Tom H
. O

Now O
that O
Sibley O
is O
not O
a O
candidate H
for O
Lt. O
Governor H
, O
there O
is O
more O
freedom N
to O
open O
up O
and O
ask O
some O
difficult O
questions N
. O

Thane O
is O
in O
Austin H
on O
Friday O
, O
but O
is O
available O
by O
phone N
. O

I H
will O
be O
on O
a O
plane N
to O
Houston O
at O
8:00 O
a.m O
. O

Can O
we H
find O
another O
time N
that O
works O
for O
us H
to O
meet O
? O

Thane O
is O
in O
an O
Ercot O
PRS N
meeting N
Friday O
from O
9:30 O
until O
3:00 O
. O

I H
am O
available O
after O
Rick's O
Rick H
's H
Friday O
budget N
meeting N
... O
are O
you H
available O
then O
? O

You H
are O
right O
, O
we H
do O
need O
a O
formal O
plan N
, O
Thane O
has O
started O
an O
initial O
draft N
. O

Thanks N

Walking O
out O
last O
night N
, O
Kevin H
Presto O
indicated O
that O
there O
were O
games N
being O
played O
in O
ERCOT O
with O
the O
new O
market N
rules N
and O
prices N
in O
certain O
markets N
were O
not O
reflective O
of O
working O
markets N
. O

Enron O
needs N
to O
use O
this O
situation N
to O
quickly O
get O
our H
viewpoints N
up O
into O
the O
PUCT O
and O
ERCOT O
ISO O
on O
what O
is O
driving O
these O
problems N
and O
our H
proposed O
fixes O
. O

If O
ERCOT O
goes O
the O
way N
of O
California O
- O
either O
due O
to O
market N
power N
or O
poor O
market N
design N
rules N
- O
it O
will O
be O
a O
bad O
day N
for O
deregulation N
and O
for O
Pat H
Wood H
. O

As O
important O
, O
the O
new O
PUCT O
Commissioners H
need O
some O
help O
right O
now O
in O
messaging N
the O
market N
. O

Let's O
Let O
's H
get O
them O
to O
support N
constructive O
solutions N
that O
will O
make O
a O
real O
difference N
. O

Jean H
and O
Thane O
, O
I H
think O
that O
we H
need O
a O
FORMAL O
PLAN N
on O
what O
to O
do O
over O
the O
next O
3 O
- O
6 O
months N
to O
leverage N
this O
situation N
. O

I H
would O
like O
to O
discuss O
this O
with O
you H
on O
Friday O
am O
. O

I H
am O
free O
at O
8 O

before O
Rick's O

You H
may O

Jim H

As O
an O
outgrowth N
of O
the O
meeting N
Leslie H
and O
I H
had O
with O
Scott H
and O
Hunter O
a O
couple N
of O
weeks N
ago O
, O
we H
have O
begun O
work N
to O
develop O
an O
electronic O
tool N
that O
would O
allow O
us H
to O
provide O
ongoing O
summaries N
of O
FERC O
gas N
activities N
, O
and O
possibly O
electric O
activities N
, O
in O
a O
format N
that O
can O
be O
linked O
to O
the O
Fundamentals O
intranet N
site N
used O
by O
the O
traders H
. O

We H
envision O
a O
format N
that O
would O
provide O
a O
brief N
summary N
and O
analysis N
of O
the O
order O
, O
filing O
, O
etc. O
with O
a O
link N
to O
the O
source N
document N
as O
well O
for O
those O
who O
would O
like O
more O
detailed O
information N
. O

This O
would O
replace O
the O
paper N
copies N
you H
and O
your H
people N
are O
currently O
getting O
. O

Many O
details N
remain O
to O
be O
worked O
out O
, O
but O
we H
will O
keep O
you H
advised O
. O

In O
the O
meantime N
, O
could O
you H
please O
provide O
a O
contact O
on O
your H
side N
with O
whom O
we H
could O

The O
application N
of O
recent O

numerical O
methods N
can O
help O
Enron O
to O
improve O
further O

reduce O
the O
consumption N
of O
compressor N

let O
me H
know O

you H
interested O
in O
introducing O
Peter H

I H
enjoyed O
your H
presentation N
, O
and O
meeting N
you H
briefly O
afterwards O
, O
at O
the O
SIAM O
Workshop O
last O
Friday O
. O

I H
have O
extensive O
experience N
as O
a O
technical O
leader H
in O
the O
design N
and O
development N
of O
modeling N
and O
simulation N
software N
products N
, O
mostly O
for O
the O
oil N
and O
gas N
pipeline N
industry N

I H
am O
looking O
for O
a O
position N
that O
can O
utilize O
my H
software N
development N
and O
mathematical O
skills N
. O

Getting O
out O
of O
the O
narrow O
confines N
of O
the O
pipeline N
simulation N
industry N
would O
be O
a O
plus O
. O

Please O
consider O
whether O
I H
might O
fit O
in O
your H
group N
. O

Your H
answer N
to O
a O
question N
indicated O
that O
I H
have O
several O
of O
the O
skills N
you H
look O
for O
. O

Also O
, O
please O
let O
me H
know O
, O
by O
email N

the O
names N
and O
contact O
information N
of O
other O
managers H
within O
Enron O
who O
might O
benefit N
from O
having O
someone H
with O
my H
qualifications N
in O
their O
group N

Attached O
are O
my H
resume N

an O
addendum N
covering O
academic O

I H
will O
call O

it O

Counterparty O
, O
the O
confirmation N
goes O
out O
with O
the O
wrong O
legal O
name N
on O
it O
seriously O
compromising O
the O
contract N
itself O
. O

That O
is O
the O
source N
of O
Tana's O
Tana O
's H
concern N
regarding O
the O
correct O
entering O
of O
divisions N
in O
the O
system N
. O

My H
suggestion N
is O
that O
Global O
Counterparty O
use O
the O
same O
name N
that O
the O
customer H
has O
signed O
on O
the O
EnronOnline O
Password N
Application O
-- O
my H
understanding N
is O
that O
the O
EnronOnline O
team N
returns O
inappropriate O
Applications N
to O
the O
customer H
until O
they O
are O
correctly O
completed O
. O

In O
this O
particular O
case N
since O
the O
counterparty O
is O
still O
not O
allowed O
to O
transact O
on O
EnronOnline O
almost O
a O
month N
after O
sending O
in O
their O
application N
they O
are O
understandably O
upset O
and O
are O
now O
complaining O
. O

I H
would O
appreciate O
it O
if O
you H
could O
get O
this O
one N
fixed O
today N
and O
, O
if O
you H
have O
any O
problem N
with O
changing O
the O
GCP O
procedure N
, O
please O
let O
me H
know O
. O

To O
Whom O
It O
May O
Concern O
: O

Through O
TV N
and O
newspapers N
, O
I H
hear O
constantly O
about O
identity N
fraud N
using O
stolen O
social O
security N
information N
. O

I H
am O
very O
concerned O
about O
this O
issue N
. O

I H
have O
the O
following O
suggestion N
for O
our H
company N
. O

Since O
Enron's O
Enron O
's H
employees H
are O
assigned O
an O
SAP N
identification N
numbers N
( O
P H
number N
) O
and O
an O
HR O
number N
, O
could O
Enron O
as O
a O
company N
use O
these O
IDs N
instead O
of O
the O
SS N
numbers N
? O

This O
will O
be O
safer O
for O
all O
employees H
. O

For O
example N
, O
I H
am O
concerned O
when O
I H
buy O
the O
monthly O
bus N
passes O
and O
I H
have O
to O
fill O
in O
my H
SS N
number N
. O

I H
do O
not O
feel O
secure O
at O
all O
to O
see O
my H
SS N
in O
so O
many O
databases N
at O
Enron O
, O
especially O
when O
some O
databases N
are O
from O
third O
- O
parties N
( O
out O
- O
sourcing O
) O
. O

We H
could O
use O
our H
badge N
number N
there O
instead O
of O
our H
SS N
. O

Please O
let O
me H
know O
how O
your H
organization N
can O
help O
the O
Enron O
employees H
feel O
safer O
about O
the O
safeguard N
of O
their O
SS N
number N
. O

Please O
calendar N
and O
print N
for O
my H
files N
on O
this O
meeting N
. O

Two O
in O
one N
day N

We H
understand O
that O
the O

planning O
to O
picket H
the O
Lake O

Our H
execution N

needs N

get O
some O
guidance N

planning O
for O
this O
picketing O
should O
it O
interfere O
with O
the O
progress N

the O

In O
that O

we H
need O
to O

plan N
and O
communicate O
that O
plan N
to O
the O

I H
think O
the O
first O
step O
is O
a O
call O
between O

then O
another O

Jeff H
- O

instead O
of O
suggesting O
a O
specific O
rate N
increase O
- O
10 O
or O
15 O
% O
, O
I H
think O
we H
should O
acknowledge O
that O
a O
" O
modest O
" O
increase O
may O
be O
necessary O
and O
may O
in O
fact N
be O
desirable O
- O
but O
that O
the O
specific O
amount N
of O
increase O
should O
be O
reasoned O
and O
subject O
to O
well O
thought O
out O
evidence N
and O
hearings N
, O
not O
just O
determined O
by O
whim N
. O

In O
general O
, O
we H
should O
not O
be O
overly O
prescriptive O
at O
this O
point N
and O
I H
know O
you H
agree O
with O
that O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
I H
think O
you H
have O
captured O
the O
points O
excellently O
. O

We're O
We H
're O
in O
the O
process N
of O
developing O
a O
strategy N
to O
take O
us H
through O
the O
next O
few O
months N
. O

But O
while O
the O
( O
otherwise O
perishable O
) O
thoughts N
are O
still O
fresh O
in O
my H
mind N
from O
the O
hearings N
on O
Monday O
and O
Tuesday O
, O
I H
wanted O
to O
throw O
out O
some O
observations N
for O
discussion N
in O
the O
days N
/ O
weeks N
ahead O
. O

OBSERVATION N
-- O
The O
pressure O
to O
finger N
somebody H
for O
" O
price N
gouging O
" O
is O
increasing O
. O

The O
administration N
is O
hell N
bent O
on O
finding O
a O
" O
fall N
guy H
. O
" O

The O
price N
spikes N
pose O
real O
political O
risks N
for O
Davis H
and O
he O
and O
his O
folks N
need O
and O
want O
an O
easy O
way N
out O
. O

His O
press N
release N
following O
the O
hearing O
renewed O
the O
call O
for O
" O
refunds N
. O
" O

On O
my H
panel N
, O
Loretta O
Lynch H
asked O
Reliant O
and O
Duke O
to O
supply N
her O
with O
the O
details N
of O
the O
contracts N
they O
cut O
to O
sell O
their O
power N
forward O
to O
marketers H
. O

And O
Carl H
Wood's O
Wood H
's H
remarks N
were O
extreme O
. O

At O
the O
Barton H
hearing O
, O
a O
liberal O
democrat O
( O
Filner O
) O
and O
a O
conservative O
Republican O
( O
Hunter H
) O
locked O
arms N
in O
calling O
for O
refunds N
. O

Bilbray O
joined O
the O
" O
gouging O
" O
band N
wagon N
. O

The O
utilities N
repeatedly O
called O
on O
FERC O
to O
do O
a O
" O
real O
" O
investigation N
, O
with O
hearings N
, O
testimony N
, O
data N
discovery N
--- O
the O
works O
. O

On O
the O
positive N
side N
, O
the O
FERC O
commissioners H
lauded O
Wolak O
, O
his O
analysis N
, O
and O
his O
remarks N
on O
the O
panel N
. O

Wolak O
said O
somewhat O
emphatically O
that O
the O
nature N
of O
California's O
California O
's H
market N
structure N
makes O
it O
impossible O
to O
single O
out O
a O
single O
participant H
as O
the O
culprit H
. O

He O
also O
stated O
that O
just O
everyone's O
everyone O
's H
just O
acting N
in O
their O
own O
self O
- O
interest N
, O
responding O
to O
the O
screwed O
incentives N
embedded O
in O
the O
structure N
. O

IMPLICATION N
-- O
It O
seems O
prudent O
for O
Enron O
to O
understand O
better O
its O
risks N
of O
getting O
fingered O
. O

In O
the O
best O
case N
, O
the O
clamoring N
for O
a O
" O
refund N
" O
subsides O
. O

In O
which O
case N
, O
the O
only O
cost O
to O
Enron O
is O
the O
internal O
cost O
incurred O
to O
understand O
better O
the O
risks N
of O
getting O
fingered O
. O

In O
the O
medium N
case N
, O
investigations N
find O
that O
Enron O
( O
like O
others O
) O
" O
played O
by O
the O
rules N
, O
" O
but O
the O
rules N
stunk O
, O
and O
Enron O
profited O
at O
the O
expense N
of O
California O
consumers H
. O

You're O
You H
're O
right O
, O
Sue H
. O

Rates N
can't O
ca O
n't O
go O
up O
w/out O
declaring O
the O
rate N
freeze O
over O
in O
some O
fashion N
--- O
trying O
to O
finesse O
it O
. O

Thanks N
very O
much O
for O
the O
comments N
. O

Harry H
also O
had O
a O
good O
comment O
--- O
don't O
do O
n't O
specify O
the O
amount N
of O
rate N
increase O
in O
our H
comments N
; O
rather O
note N
that O
the O
rate N
increase O
needs N
to O
be O
well O
- O
reasoned O
and O
based O
on O
facts N
and O
evidence N
. O

Will O
make O
that O
change O
. O

Just O

what O

Enron's O
Enron O

are O

more O
interest N

than O
natural O

They O
are O
currently O
working O

Callon O
in O

The O
initial O
reservoir N
reports N
estimate N
reserves N
of O
80 O
- O
120 O
million O
barrels N
of O
sour O
crude O
and O
they O
estimate N
initial O
production N
to O
be O
40,000 O
bpd O
starting O
in O
1Q O
2003 O

Quality N
is O

Tom's O
Tom H

if O
we H
have O
any O
interesting O
in O
buying O
the O
crude O
on O
either O
a O
fixed O
or O
floating O
basis N

The O
floating O
could O
be O
tied O
to O
a O
Platt's O
Platt O

index N
or O
the O
NYMEX O
. O

It O
is O
far O
too O
early O
to O
expect O
Murphy H
to O
enter O
into O
a O
physical O
or O
financial O
contract N
, O
but O
Tom H
hopes N
to O
get O
us H
first O
and O
/ O
or O
last O
look O
from O
Murphy H
when O
the O
time N
is O
right O
. O

Another O
alternative O
is O
to O
give O
Murphy H
barrels N
at O
their O
95,000 O

Meraux O

Louisiana O
refinery N

for O

yesterday N
; O
for O
these O
types N
of O
deals N
, O
i H
dont O
do O
nt O
think O
its O
it O
s H
necessary O
to O
have O
all O
the O
documentation N
of O
our H
counterparty's O
counterparty O
's H
authorization N
to O
enter O
into O
the O
agreement N
. O

these O
are O
short O
term N
transactions N
and O
requiring O
this O
documentation N
will O
cause N
us H
to O
lose O
business N
because O
competitive O
alternatives N
do O
not O
have O
such O
burdensome O
requirements N
. O

the O
primary O
reason N
we H
need O
these O
things N
is O
for O
the O
scenario N
where O
a O
muni O
does O
a O
derivative N
deal O
with O
an O
open O
- O
ended O
downside N
, O
loses O
$ O
50 O
million O
, O
and O
then O
claims N
that O
it O
was O
not O
a O
valid O
contract N
. O

in O
our H
case N
, O
they O
are O
only O
hedging O
. O

we H
are O
collecting O
a O
premium N
up O
front N
and O
their O
total N
cost O
is O
known O
up O
front N
. O

therefore O
they O
will O
not O
attempt N
to O
make O
this O
claim O
. O

even O
if O
they O
did O
, O
our H
risk N
is O
limited O
to O
the O
premium N
, O
not O
some O
big O
payout O
. O

the O
risk N
of O
losing O
business N
is O
far O
greater O
than O
the O
risk N
of O
a O
counterparty O
trying O
to O
get O
their O
premium N
back O
. O

seems O
like O
a O
5 O
second N
decision N
to O
me H
. O

is O
it O
possible O
to O
combine O
the O
standard O
isda O
and O
our H
confirm O
into O
a O
single O
long O
form N
? O

by O
going O
away O
from O
the O
standard O
isda O
maybe O
we H
can O
eliminate O
these O
requirements N
because O
the O
payout O
liability N
is O
only O
1 O

What O
happened O
? O

Here's O
Here O
's H
a O
story N
... O
as O
I H
was O
waiting O
at O
the O
bus N
stop N
( O
7:35 O
am O
) O
to O
go O
to O
school N
, O
a O
lady H
approached O
me H
and O
asked O
if O
I'd O
I H
'd O
make O
sure O
her O
daughter H
got O
on O
a O
certain O
bus N
. O

The O
mother H
was O
running O
late O
for O
work N
and O
could O
not O
wait N
. O

I H
couldn't O
could O
n't O
say O
no O
... O
so O
Nicki O
( O
the O
little O
girl H
- O
10 O
yrs. N
old O
) O
and O
I H
waited O
for O
the O
bus N
. O

It O
was O
now O
, O
8:15 O
and O
there O
was O
no O
sign N
of O
her O
bus N
. O

On O
top N
of O
things N
, O
I H
had O
quiz N
at O
8 O
am O
. O

Which O
I H
then O
realized O
I H
missed O
. O

I H
decided O
that O
Nicki O
would O
just O
have O
to O
wait N
on O
her O
own O
. O

I H
asked O
her O
if O
she O
had O
any O
relatives A
that O
would O
want O
to O
know O
of O
her O
whereabouts N
. O

I H
called O
her O
grandmother H
and O
explained O
things N
to O
her O
. O

Pretty O
strange O
... O
aye O
. O

A H
bus N
that O
runs O
through O
UofH O
arrived O
and O
I H
almost O
got O
on O
without O
her O
, O
but O
I H
couldn't O
could O
n't O
do O
it O
. O

Finally O
, O
I H
told O
the O
little O
girl H
that O
she O
would O
have O
to O
accompany O
me H
to O
school N
( O
8:30 O
am O
) O
. O

There O
were O
only O
15 O
minutes N
left O
of O
class N
. O

I H
stayed O
for O
the O
remainder N
of O
the O
lecture N
. O

After O
class N
we H
went O
back O
to O
bus N
stop N
and O
within O
minutes N
her O
bus N
arrived O
. O

I H
told O
the O
bus N
driver H
where O
to O
drop O
her O
off O
. O

I H
notified O
her O
grandmother H
with O
the O
time N
of O
the O
departure N
. O

And O
I H
was O
relieved O
when O
Nicki O
called O
to O
let O
me H
know O
she O
was O
home N
safe O
. O

Please O
send O
the O
memo N
to O
the O
EGM O
business N
heads N
as O
well O
. O

Thanks N
. O

Carol H
: O

I H
have O
attempted O
to O
incorporate O
the O
changes N
that O
Jim H
has O
incorporated O
in O
our H
long O
form N
power N
agreement N
which O
ENA O
has O
suggested O
to O
date N
into O
the O
short O
form N
. O

Attached O
please O
find O
a O
sample N
short O
form N
( O
for O
the O
Con O
Ed H
market N
) O
for O
your H
review N
. O

Please O
note N
the O
following O
as O
you H
review N
: O

1 O
. O
The O
short O
forms N
do O
not O
contain O
the O
optionality O
relating O
to O
our H
performing N
billing N
services N
-- O
all O
of O
our H
midmarket O
forms N
anticipate O
that O
we H
will O
act N
as O
customer's O
customer H
's H
billing N
agent H
and O
that O
we H
will O
collect O
all O
amounts N
due O
related O
to O
T&D O
and O
the O
like O
from O
the O
customer H
( O
and O
reflect O
same O
on O
our H
invoice N
) O
and O
pass O
those O
amounts N
on O
to O
the O
customer's O
customer H
's H
utility N
. O

2 O
. O
I H
did O
not O
include O
a O
" O
Setoff N
" O
provision N
in O
this O
draft N
, O
mainly O
because O
the O
vast O
majority N
of O
the O
time N
, O
we H
will O
not O
, O
nor O
will O
an O
affiliate H
, O
have O
another O
agreement N
in O
place N
with O
these O
customers H
. O

If O
you H
feel O
strongly O
about O
our H
including O
a O
setoff N
provision N
, O
we H
will O
do O
so O
. O

3 O
. O
The O
change O
in O
law N
provision N
reads O
a O
bit N
differently O
from O
the O
long O
form N
-- O
the O
thinking O
here O
is O
that O
the O
long O
form N
language N
is O
very O
lengthy O
and O
rather O
harsh O
( O
and O
we've O
we H
've O
had O
great O
difficulty N
selling O
it O
in O
the O
past N
) O
. O

Taking O
into O
consideration N
this O
class N
of O
customer H
, O
we H
decided O
to O
include O
certain O
items N
, O
including O
our H
inability N
to O
cover O
our H
costs O
due O
to O
a O
change O
in O
law N
, O
rules N
or O
practices N
as O
a O
" O
force N
majeure O
event N
" O
in O
an O
effort N
to O
soften O
the O
approach N
( O
see O
the O
GTCs O
) O
. O

Also O
we H
do O
not O
address N
calculation N
of O
a O
termination N
payment N
in O
the O
event N
of O
a O
change O
in O
law N
as O
the O
long O
form N
does O
-- O
again O
, O
more O
in O
the O
interest N
of O
" O
saving O
space N
" O
than O
anything O
else O
... O

Let O
us H
know O
your H
thoughts N
on O
this O
document N
and O
if O
you H
are O
comfortable O
with O
our H
using O
this O
until O
such O
time N
as O
the O
hybrid N
form N
is O
launched O
. O

If O
you H
are O
comfortable O
, O
we H
will O
drive O
these O
changes N
into O
our H
other O
midmarket O
power N
forms N

Carol H

I H
think O
Valerie H
Mooney O
( O
our H
credit N

) O
and O
Ed H
Sacks O
are O
still O
discussing O
some O
minor O
fine O
tuning N

the O

I H
spoke O
to O
Bob H

this O

we're O
we H
're O
all O
set O
on O
the O

the O

and O
there O
is O
a O
minor O
credit N

billing N
issue N
in O
Paragraph N
13 O
related O
to O
the O
timing N
of O
transfer H
of O
interest N
on O
collateral O
that O
Val H
will O
discuss O
with O
Ed H
as O
well O
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
EEI O
goes O
, O
the O
only O
remaining O
issue N
that O
I'm O
I H
'm O
aware O
of O
( O
aside O
from O
finalizing O
the O
LOC O
) O
is O
whether O
we've O
we H
've O
finished O
coordinating O
the O
Attachment N

does O
n't O
understand O
why O
the O

It O

the O

the O

It O
is O
a O
fairly O

fully O
reimbursable O

Transwestern O

own O

to O

California O
's H
energy N

to O
determine O
whether O
they O
acted O
in O
concert N
to O
manipulate O

The O
investigative O
committee N

headed O
by O
state N
Sen. O
Joe H

, O

Santa O

focusing O
on O
a O
series N

with O
enough O

that O
it O

into O
the O
power N
- O
buying O
business N
and O
helped O
make O
billions N
of O
dollars N
for O
power N
producers H
. O

The O
central O
question N
behind O
the O
palace N
coup O
is O
whether O
Terry H
Winter H
, O
the O
president H
of O
the O
Independent O
System O
Operator O
, O
acted O
alone O
when O
he O
took O
steps N
to O
remove O
key N
price N
caps N
designed O
to O
limit O
the O
amount N
power N
generators N
could O
charge O
. O

Winter H
defied O
his O
own O
board N
and O
Gov. O
Gray H
Davis H
when O
he O
filed O
a O
50 O

page N
request N

the O

. O

" O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
these O
events N
could O
have O
taken O
place N
without O
some O
concerted O
effort N
, O
" O
said O
Dunn H
. O

The O
subpoenas N
will O
force N
those O
involved O
, O
including O
Winter H
, O
to O
provide O
sworn O
testimony N
about O
the O
events N
to O
the O
committee N
, O
and O
to O
turn O
over O
e-mails N
, O
personal O

memos N
. O

Davis H
spokesman H
Steve H
Maviglio O
said O
the O
governor H
felt N
" O
betrayed O
" O
by O
the O
actions N
of O
Winter H
. O

" O
The O
governor H
believes O
it O
was O
the O
defining O
moment N
, O
when O
what O
was O
a O
mounting N
problem N
turned O
into O
an O
instant O
crisis N

Maviglio O
said O

all O

ISO O
spokesman H
Gregg H
Fishman O
said O
Dunn's O
Dunn H

committee N
will O
find O
no O
criminal O
conduct O
. O

The O
decision N
was O
made O
by O
ISO O
upper O
management N
with O
one N
goal N
in O
mind N
: O
to O
keep O
the O
lights N
on O
. O

At O
the O
time N
, O
generators N
were O
refusing O
to O
sell O
power N
in O
California O
because O
of O
the O
price N
caps N
. O

" O
It O
was O
an O
emergency N
, O
" O
Fishman O
said O
. O

" O
We H
had O
to O
take O
action N
. O
'' O

What O
became O
known O
as O
the O
palace N
coup O
began O
on O
Oct. O
26 O
when O
ISO O
board N
members H
voted O
for O
severe O
restrictions N
on O
the O
amount N
of O
money N
electricity N
producers H
could O
charge O
for O
power N
. O

The O
restrictions N
would O
drive O
prices N
as O
low O
as O
$ O
65 O
per O
megawatt N
- O
nearly O
12 O
times N
below O
the O
$ O
750 O
per O
megawatt N
limits N
of O
seven O
months N
earlier O
. O

" O
They O
( O
electricity N
generators N
) O
grinned O
and O
beared O
the O
$ O
750 O
price N
cap N
, O
but O
this O
new O
plan N
by O
ISO O
was O
too O
much O
, O
" O
said O
Dunn H
, O
whose O
committee N
has O
been O
investigating O
since O
March O
. O

" O
All O
hell N
broke O
loose O
. O
'' O

Records N
show O
that O
on O
Oct. O
31 O
, O
power N
generators N
and O
electricity N
traders H
filed O
letters N
with O
the O
Federal O
Energy N
Regulatory O
Commission N
, O
demanding O
that O
the O
new O
plan N
be O
killed O
. O

The O
letters N
, O
six O
in O
all O
, O
were O
sent O
within O
two O
hours N
of O
each O
other O
and O
represented O
dozens N
of O
power N
generators N
. O

" O
If O
not O
removed O
immediately O
, O
the O
( O
ISO O
) O
price N
cap N
will O
sow O
confusion N
in O
the O

threaten O

investment N
in O

capacity N
, O
'' O
read O
one N
letter N
written O
by O
Duke O
Energy N
Vice N
President H
William H
Hall H
III O
. O

Although O
there O
is O
nothing N
illegal O
about O
the O
generators N
acting N
together O
to O
lobby N
against O
price N
caps N
, O
Dunn H
believes O
the O
letters N
and O
other O
actions N
around O
the O
same O
time N
showed O
clear N
coordination N
among O
energy N
officials O
. O

He O
said O
the O
main O
aim N
of O
the O
subpoenas N
will O
be O
to O
determine O
whether O
collusion N
occurred O
to O
" O
fix O
" O
prices N
, O
which O
would O
violate O
federal O
trade N
laws N
. O

In O
the O
Oct. O
31 O
letters N
, O
electricity N
producers H
told O
federal O
officials O
that O
if O
price N
caps N
weren't O
were O
n't O
removed O
it O
would O
lead O
to O
a O
collapse N
of O
the O
energy N
market N
. O

The O
generators N
got O
their O
way N
. O

The O
next O
day N
, O
the O
federal O
commission N
killed O
the O
new O
pricing N
plan N
. O

What O
was O
left O
in O
place N
was O
a O
$ O
250 O
price N
cap N
established O
five O
months N
earlier O
. O

Power N
producers H
then O
turned O
their O
attention N
toward O
killing O
that O
cap N
, O
saying O
they O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
make O
a O
profit N
even O
under O
these O
constraints N
. O

They O
began O
to O
withhold O
power N
from O
California O
, O
and O
on O
Dec. O
7 O
the O
ISO O
declared O
its O
first O
Stage N
3 O
emergency N
and O
braced O
for O
blackouts N
, O
which O
were O
narrowly O
averted O
. O

What O
followed O
the O
next O
day N
is O
considered O
by O
the O
governor H
and O
Dunn H
to O
be O
the O
pivotal O
moment N
of O
the O
energy N
crisis N
. O

Winter H
, O
who O
in O
his O
position N
as O
president H
and O
chief O
operating O
officer H
of O
the O
ISO O

request N

asking O
federal O
officials O
to O
abolish O
the O

Final O
authority N
over O
lifting O
the O

rested O
with O
the O

Neither O
the O
ISO O

" O
It O
was O
beyond O

something O

significant O

This O
action N

Robinson H
said O
the O
filing O

granted O
two O
hours N

the O
request N

helped O
rather O
than O
hurt O
Californians O

Prices N
, O
he O
said O
, O
did O
not O
spike O
as O
a O
result N

Instead O
they O
followed O

I H
am O

discuss O
our H
view N

the O
ability N

extend O
our H
current O

( O
for O

already O

) O
. O

Can O
we H
discuss O
this O
today N
or O
soon O
thereafter O
. O

My H
take O
is O
that O
the O
UDCs O
will O
be O
indifferent O
to O
this O
( O
maybe O
? O
) O
and O
our H
# O
1 O
priority N
is O
to O
work N
to O
get O
the O
PG&E O
model N

the O

Any O
news N

how O

move O

good O

I H
suggest O
a O
" O
blind O
draw O

best O
ball N
not O

as O
for O
the O

no O

team N

one N

Is O
there O
any O
question N

I'll O
I H

leave O

a O
two O
way N

Have O
they O
expressed O
any O
interest N
in O
negotiating O
? O

There O
is O
nothing N
wrong O
with O
a O
REAL O
negotiation N
, O
but O
nothing N
particularly O
helpful O
about O
generating O
one N

in O
the O
absence N

Where O
is O
the O
" O
simple O
" O
explanation N
of O
the O
transportation N
piece N

As O
I H
have O
told O
RNR O
, O
I H
think O
we H
should O
advise O
Duke O
in O
writing N
that O
its O
IP O
is O
not O
in O
conformity N
with O
the O
contract N
, O
since O
it O
is O
in O
the O
alternative O
, O
and O
that O
our H
IP O
is O
hence O
the O
only O
one N
that O
will O
be O
before O
the O
arbitrators H
( O
since O
Duke O
clearly O
cannot O
can O
not O
change O
it's O
ineffective O
IP O
at O
this O
stage N
, O
having O
already O
seen O
ours H
) O
. O

Accordingly O
, O
the O
only O
issue N
left O
for O
arbitration N
is O
whether O
our H
IP O
( O
the O
only O
one N
and O
therefore O
the O
one N
they O
have O
to O
choose O
) O
is O
or O
is O
not O
an O
economic O
hardship N
under O
the O
contract N
. O

Dear O
Mr. N
Sanders H
- O

? O

While O
I H
left O
a O
you H
a O
phone N
message N
with O
some O
information N
about O
our H
project N
, O
I H
thought O
I H
could O
give O
you H
some O
additional O
details N
by O
e-mail N
as O
well O
... O

? O

We H
are O
still O
very O
interested O
in O
having O
Enron O
support N
our H
eCommerce O
Dispute N
Management O
Protocol N
.? O

We H
have O
had O
enthusiastic O
responses N
from O
companies N
such O
as O
AT&T O
, O
Duke O
Energy N
, O
Pitney O
Bowes O
and O
Daimler O
Chrysler O
, O
and O
I H
would O
be O
pleased O
to O
answer N
any O
questions N
you H
may O
have O
about O
this O
focal O
point N
for O
our H
educational O
efforts N
.? O

The O
real O
purpose N
of O
my H
call O
, O
however O
, O
is O
related O
to O
the O
services N
we H
will O
provide O
to O
support N
the O
aspirational O
statements N
of O
the O
Protocol N
. O

I H
am O
a O
member N
of O
the O
design N
group N
that O
has O
been O
developing O
the O
American O
Arbitration O
Association's O
Association N
's H
dispute N
management N
systems N
and O
services N
for O
eCommerce O
B2B O
transactions N
.? O

At O
this O
time N
we H
are O
putting O
together O
small O
working O
groups N
to O
validate O
some O
of O
our H
assumptions N
and O
refine O
our H
initial O
service N
offerings N
. O

Initially O
our H
design N
group N
, O
along O
with O
perhaps O
one N
of O
our H
technology N
consultants H
, O
would O
like O
to O
meet O
with O
a O
group N
of O
Enron O
people N
for O
half O
a O
day N
.? O

Ideally O
this O
group N
would O
consist O
of O
four O
to O
six O
people N
from O
finance O
, O
legal O
, O
and O
operations N
so O
that O
we H
get O
good O
cross-functional O
feedback N
about O
our H
services N
.? O

Before O
the O
meeting N
we H
would O
provide O
you H
with O
a O
brief N
description N
of O
our H
proposed O
service N
offerings N
and O
a O
list N
of O
points O
for O
discussion N
at O
the O
meeting N
. O

The O
real O
focus O
of O
the O
meeting N
will O
be O
on O
how O
we H
should O
build O
these O
services N
to O
meet O
the O
needs N
of O
businesses N
operating O
in O
B2B O
marketplaces N
.? O

We H
are O
very O
concerned O
with O
providing O
services N
that O
are O
relevant O
to O
that O
environment N
. O

We H
would O
like O
to O
meet O
between O
November O
14 O
and O
? O
December O
1 O
? O
since O
construction N
of O
our H
services N
is O
already O
underway O
.? O

Please O
let O
me H
know O
what O
is O
possible O
, O
and O
feel O
free O
to O
give O
me H
a O
call O
if O
you H
have O
any O
questions N
( O

the O
industry N
of O
Marriage N
and O
Kids O
, O
you H
heard O
me H
. O

Marriage N
is O
, O
in O
and O
of O
itself O
, O
a O
noble O
concept N
, O
but O
it O
too O
often O
leads O
to O
kids H
and O
kids H
flat O
out O
suck O
. O

How O
can O
I H
say O
such O
an O
abomination H
, O
ask O
you H
? O

Look O
around O
you H
and O
notice O
all O
the O
mind N
numbing O
trailor O
trash N
cretins H
out O
there O
who O
should O
not O
be O
procreating O
, O
yet O
they O
do O
. O

These O
are O
the O
people N
who O
keep O
Jerry H
springer O
on O
the O
air N
. O

These O
are O
the O
kids H
who O
will O
destroy O
society N
, O
because O
of O
the O
crapfest O
the O
American O
family H
has O
become O
under O
the O
post N
hippie O
culture N
, O
you H
heard O
again O
. O

And O
you H
might O
think O
by O
reading O
this O
I H
blame N
the O
kids H
..... O

Not O
so O
, O
Kids O
are O
what O
kids H
are O
and O
will O
do O
what O
they O
do O
. O

It O
is O
literally O
monkey A
see O
and O
monkey A
do O
with O
them O
. O

That O
will O
likely O
never O
change O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
the O
bad O
parents H
out O
there O
who O
fuck O
up O
their O
lives O
and O
dont O
do O
nt O
seem O
to O
understand O
that O
once O
you H
decide O
to O
have O
kids H
, O
it O
is O
indeed O
time N
to O
grow O
up O
and O
be O
a O
responsible O
role N
model N
for O
those O
kids H
. O

Very O
few O
parents H
do O
this O
. O

And O
this O
is O
a O
direct O
result N
of O
the O
Politically O
correct O
, O
permissive O
, O
time N
out O
granting O
bullshit N
liberal O
culture N
that O
has O
caused O
this O
. O

When O
you H
blame N
it O
all O
on O
society N
, O
there's O
there O
's H
noone O
to O
to O
take O
responsibility N
and O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
you H
have O
generation N
of O
fucked O
up O
kids H
who O
are O
likley O
smoking O
, O
drinking O
, O
doing O
drugs N
, O
fucking O
the O
neighbor H
or O
some O
internet N
perv O
just O
because O
you H
are O
too O
lazy O
to O
see O
waht O
they're O
they O
're O
doing O
. O

People N
like O
this O
will O
never O
have O
my H
sympathy N
, O
nor O
do O
they O
deserve O
my H
sympathy N
. O

Look O
inside O
yourselves H
parents H
, O
is O
this O
you H
? O

Probably O
it O
is O
. O

Fuck O
you H
. O

Stop O
trying O
to O
pawn O
your H
brats H
off O
on O
others O
to O
" O
get O
a O
break O
" O
. O

You H
made O

choice N

be O
a O
mommy H
, O
you H
dont O
do O
nt O
get O
a O
break O
until O
they O
move O
out O
, O
thats O
that O
s H
the O
choice N
that O
you H
madea O
and O
that's O
that O
's H
life N

Tough O

you're O
you H

It O
looks O
like O
NASA O
is O
ready O
to O
sour O
again O
after O
it's O
devastating O
loss N
from O
the O
Columbia O
accident N
which O
occurred O
nearly O
two O
years N
ago O
. O

Now O
, O
NASA O
engineers H
and O
astronauts H
are O
almost O
giddy O
with O
" O
go O
" O
fever N
as O
the O
tentative O
date N
for O
the O
first O
launch N
since O
the O
Columbia O
disaster N
approaches O
. O

The O
most O
important O
question N
isn't O
is O
n't O
whether O
Discovery O
is O
technically O
ready O
to O
fly O
with O
new O
safety N
features O
and O
emergency N
procedures N
, O
but O
whether O
the O
agency N
itself O
has O
learned O
from O
the O
crucial O
errors N
most O
common O
to O
Challenger O
and O
Columbia O
, O
errors N
that O
grew O
out O
of O
a O
management N
culture N
that O
discouraged O
criticism N
and O
sacrificed O
safety N
for O
image N
- O
puffing N
and O
budget N
- O
cutting N
. O

I H
hope O
so O
. O

Seeing O
another O
" O
Columbia O
" O
incident N
can O
be O
quite O
frightening O
( O
I H
woke O
up O
to O
it O
early O
in O
the O
morning N
when O
I H
was O
in O
Texas O
) O
. O

We H
don't O
do O
n't O
need O
another O
incident N
as O
exploring O
the O
cosmos N
is O
something O
that O
keeps O
our H
imagination N
going O
as O
a O
species A
. O

Maybe O
one N
day N
they O
will O
allow O
space N
tourism N
, O
( O
hopefully O
that O
will O
be O
in O
the O
near O
future N
) O
although O
I H
would O
recommend O
that O
NASA O
build O
new O
shuttles N
instead O
of O
trying O
to O
preserve O
the O
older O
ones N
. O

You H
do O
have O
to O
give O
NASA O
credit N
on O
some O
things N
as O
they O
have O
eliminated O
the O
" O
fear N
of O
reporting N
failure N
" O
culture N
that O
probably O
led O
to O
the O
lack N
of O
reporting N
defects N
on O
the O
Columbia O
shuttle N
. O

Instead O
they O
are O
encouraging O
everyone O
to O
come O
forward O
if O
they O
see O
any O
potential N
problems N
( O
as O
it O
is O
clear N
that O
overlooked O
problems N
could O
result N
in O
unnecessary O
losses N
) O
. O

But O
supporters H
are O
pointing O
a O
few O
good O
things N
out O
: O

Clearly O
, O
the O
agency N
has O
worked O
hard O
at O
tackling O
the O
technical O
challenges N
posed O
by O
a O
superb O
and O
surprisingly O
independent O
- O
minded O
investigative O
panel N
. O

A H
few O
weeks N
ago O
, O
shuttle N
workers H
at O
the O
Kennedy H
Space N
Center O
received O
a O
rocket N
- O
like O
boost N
in O
morale N
with O
two O
important O
deliveries N
for O
the O
next O
shuttle N
to O
carry O
. O

One O
is O
a O
special O
tool N
to O
detect O
damage N
to O
the O
thermal O
- O
protective O
tile N
while O
in O
orbit N
- O
something O
the O
Columbia O
crew N
would O
have O
welcomed O
. O

The O
other O
is O
a O
new O
fuel N
tank N
" O
guaranteed O
" O
by O
NASA O
not O
to O
shed O
potentially O
fatal O
hunks N
of O
insulation N
. O

NASA O
has O
some O
PR N
hurdles N
to O
overcome O
in O
the O
future N
. O

But O
lets O
let O
s H
hope O
for O
their O
sake N
( O
and O
the O
sake N
of O
all O
space N
lovers H
out O
there O
) O
that O
they O
can O
redefine O
their O
image N
and O
rekindle O
the O
hope O
of O
space N
colonization N
again O
. O

In O
George H
Orwell's O
Orwell O
's H
influential O
novel N
" O
1984 O
" O
doublethink N

a O
device N

state N

make O

of O

power N

shape N

personal O

at O

all O
one N

, O
we H
are O
all O
together O
in O
this O
thing N
called O
life N
, O
we H
human O
beings A
, O
the O
birds A
and O
the O
tress A
, O
the O
rocks N
and O
the O
sky O
, O
all O
of O
it O
. O

I H
have O
written O
a O
lot N
recently O
about O
healing O
the O
self O
so O
today N
here O
are O
a O
few O
words N
on O
healing O
our H
collective O
body N
, O
mind N
and O
soul N
. O

Think O
of O
all O
life N
, O
if O
you H
will O
, O
as O
one N
great O
choir N
or O
one N
grand O
congregation N
. O

Our H
strength N
is O
in O
our H
unity N
and O
harmony N
. O

Any O
major O
dischord O
and O
we H
all O
suffer O
. O

Any O
insult N
to O
the O
collective O
good O
brings O
us H
all O
down O
. O

Living O
out O
of O
synch O
with O
nature N
is O
the O
great O
disease N
, O
from O
that O
flows N
all O
the O
tributaries N
we H
have O
come O
to O
think O
of O
as O
sickness N
. O

We H
are O
only O
as O
strong O
as O
our H
weakest O
, O
we H
are O
only O
as O
healthy O
as O
the O
sickest O
amongst O
us H
- O
playing O
sports N
and O
being O
in O
the O
army N
taught O
me H
that O
lesson N
before O
I H
was O
finished O
being O
a O
teenager H
. O

When O
the O
healthy O
treat O
the O
sick O
with O
scorn N
and O
intolerance N
it O
brings O
us H
all O
down O
. O

When O
those O
lucky O
enough O
not O
to O
have O
Herpes N
create O
a O
climate N
of O
shame N
and O
indignity N
for O
those O
of O
us H
who O
do O
, O
not O
only O
are O
they O
hurting O
us H
, O
but O
they O
are O
hurting O
themselves O
. O

There O
is O
no O
escape O
from O
the O
collective O
ocean N
we H
all O
swim O
in O
. O

What O
you H
project N
will O
always O
come O
back O
to O
either O
reward O
or O
haunt O
you H
. O

We H
are O
now O
suffering N
from O
the O
consequences N
of O
our H
rape N
of O
the O
environment N
, O
our H
rejection N
of O
the O
natural O
for O
the O
industrial O
, O
and O
our H
embrace O
of O
violence N
over O
peace N
. O

Jesus H
said O
that O
what O
you H
do O
the O
least O
of O
the O
people N
you H
do O
to O
him O
. O

What O
are O
you H
doing O
to O
the O
least O
of O
the O
people N
? O

If O
we H
are O
all O
in O
this O
thing N
together O
, O
let's O
let O
's H
play O
nice O
. O

Remember O
that O
what O
you H
do O
to O
yourself H
affects O
me H
and O
everybody O
else O
, O
remember O
that O
what O
you H
do O
to O
me H
and O
anyone O
else O
shapes O
your H
destiny N
. O

No O
matter N
what O
progress N
we H
make O
as O
individuals H
in O
becoming O
healthier O
, O
we H
will O
never O
achieve O
real O
health N
until O
we H
collectively O
decide O
to O
create O
a O
healthier O
reality N
. O

Fortunately O
circumstances N
will O
force N
our H
hand N
soon O
since O
our H
collective O
bad O
behaviour N
cannot O
can O
not O
continue O
indefinitely O
. O

In O
the O
near O
future N
collective O
choices N
will O
need O
to O
be O
made O
. O

Will O
we H
choose O
to O
live O
in O
harmony N
with O
this O
planet N
or O
crash O
and O
burn O
in O
a O
conflagration N
of O
arrogance N
and O
disregard N
? O

Will O
we H
choose O
to O
rise N
about O
prejudice N
and O
intolerance N
or O
go O
down O
kicking O
and O
screaming O
with O
holding O
on O
to O
fear N
and O
anger N
? O

There O
is O
no O
health N
without O
peace N
and O
no O
peace N
without O
health N

Kaoshikii O
is O
a O
dance O
which O
was O
invented O
in O
1978 O
by O
Shrii O
Shrii O
A'nandamu'rti O
. O

It O
is O
a O
psycho-spiritual O
exercise N
and O
benefiting O
the O
mind N
by O
developing O
stamina N
and O
strength N
. O

Kaoshikii O
is O
especially O
good O
for O
women H
. O

It O
can O

, O
keeps O
the O
body N

and O
enables O
an O
easy O

Kaoshikii O
comes O
from O
the O
Sanskrit O
word N
' O
kosa O
' O
meaning N
shell N
or O
layer O
of O
mind N
. O

The O
self O
of O
the O
individual O
lies N
hidden O
in O
the O
innermost O
layers N
of O
existence N
( O
kosas O
) O
. O

Thus O
kaoshikii O
is O
a O
blossoming N
of O
the O
microcosm N
( O
unit N
being O
) O
in O
its O
attempt N
to O
attain O
a O
link N
with O
the O
Macrocosm N
( O
Cosmic O
Consciousness N
) O
. O

This O
attempt N
is O
normally O
referred O

as O
mysticism N

The O

Hi O
all O
, O

There O
are O
already O
several O
forums N
around O
the O
net O
focused O
on O
discussing O
Guild O
Wars O
, O
so O
why O
create O
a O
new O
one N
? O

I H
say O
why O
not O
? O

The O
main O
reason N
is O
Google O
is O
more O
accessible O
to O
the O
global O
community N
and O
you H
can O
rest N
assured O
that O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
going O
to O
go O
away O
. O

I H
have O
seen O
great O
fan N
sites N
suddenly O
disappear O
without O
notice O
and O
for O
no O
reason N
. O

Usually O
this O
happens O
because O
the O
developer H
of O
the O
site N
can O
no O
longer O
afford O
the O
cost O
of O
bandwidth N
being O
used O
. O

That O
said O
, O
the O
maintenance N
of O
this O
forum N
is O
handled O
by O
Google O
and O
thus O
will O
remain O
reliable O
and O
it O
will O
ultimately O
give O
us H
more O
time N
to O
play O
:) O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
nothing N
more O
than O
a O
devoted O
fan N
of O
the O
game N
myself H
and O
I H
hope O
that O
this O
area N
can O
become O
a O
haven N
for O
deep O
fan N
discussions N
. O

This O
letter N
might O
surprise O
you H
because O
we H
have O
not O
met O
neither O
in O

nor O
by O

I H
came O
to O
know O
of O
you H
in O
my H
search N
for O
a O
reliable O
and O
reputable O
person H
to O
handle N
a O
very O
confidential O
business N
transaction N
, O
which O
involves O
the O
transfer H
of O
a O
huge O
sum N
of O
money N
to O
an O
account O
requiring O
maximum O
confidence N
. O

I H
am O
writing N
you H
in O
absolute O
confidence N
primarily O
to O
seek O
your H
assistance N
in O
acquiring O
oil N
funds N
that O
are O
presently O
trapped O
in O
the O
republic O
of O
Iraq O
. O

My H
partners H
and O
I H
solicit O
your H
assistance N
in O
completing O
a O
transaction N
begun O
by O
my H
father H
, O
who O
has O
long O
been O
actively O
engaged O
in O
the O
extraction N
of O
petroleum N
in O
the O
United O
States O
of O
America O
, O
and O
bravely O
served O
his O
country N
as O
director H
of O
the O
United O
States O
Central O
Intelligence O
Agency O
. O

In O
the O
decade N
of O
the O
nineteen O
- O
eighties N
, O
my H
father H
, O
then O
vice O
- O
president H
of O
the O
United O
States O
of O
America O
, O
sought O
to O
work N
with O
the O
good O
offices N
of O
the O
President H
of O
the O
Republic O
of O
Iraq O
to O
regain O
lost O
oil N
revenue N
sources N
in O
the O
neighboring O
Islamic O
republic O
of O
Iran O
. O

This O
unsuccessful O
venture N
was O
soon O
followed O
by O
a O
falling O
- O
out O
with O
his O
Iraqi O
partner H
, O
who O
sought O
to O
acquire O
additional O
oil N
revenue N
sources N
in O
the O
neighboring O
emirate N
of O
Kuwait O
, O
a O
wholly O
- O
owned O
U.S. O
- O
British O
subsidiary N
. O

My H
father H
re-secured O
the O
petroleum N
assets N
of O
Kuwait O
in O
1991 O
at O
a O
cost O
of O
sixty O
- O
one N
billion O
U.S. O
dollars N
( O
$ O
61,000,000,000 O
) O
. O

Out O
of O
that O
cost O
, O
thirty O
- O
six O
billion O
dollars N
( O
$ O
36,000,000,000 O
) O
were O
supplied O
by O
King O
Hussein H
, O
Kingdom O
of O
Saudi O
Arabia O
and O
other O
Persian O
Gulf O
monarchies N
, O
and O
sixteen O
billion O
dollars N
( O
$ O
16,000,000,000 O
) O
supplied O
by O
German O
and O
Japanese O
partners H
. O

But O
my H
father's O
father H
's H
former O
Iraqi O
business N
partner H
remained O
in O
control N
of O
the O
republic O
of O
Iraq O
and O
its O
petroleum N
reserves N
. O

My H
family H
is O
calling O
for O
your H
urgent O
assistance N
in O
funding N
the O
removal N
of O
the O
President H
of O
the O
Republic O
of O
Iraq O
and O
acquiring O
the O
petroleum N
assets N
of O
his O
country N
, O
as O
compensation N
for O
the O
costs O
of O
removing O
him O
from O
power N
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
our H
partners H
from O
1991 O
are O
not O
willing O
to O
shoulder N
the O
burden N
of O
this O
new O
venture N
, O
which O
in O
its O
upcoming O
phase N
may O
cost O
the O
sum N
of O
100 O
billion O
to O
200 O
billion O
dollars N
( O
$ O
100,000,000,000 O
- O
$ O
200,000,000,000 O
) O
, O
both O
in O
the O
initial O
acquisition N
and O
in O
long O
- O
term N
management N
. O

Without O
the O
funds N
from O
our H
1991 O
partners H
, O
we H
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
acquire O
the O
oil N
revenue N
trapped O
within O
Iraq O
. O

That O
is O
why O
my H
family H
and O
our H
colleagues H
are O
urgently O
seeking O
your H
gracious O
assistance N
. O

Our H
distinguished O

the O
venture N
was O
demonstrated O
in O
the O
naming O
of O

her O
. O

I H
would O

make O
this O
transfer H
before O
the O
fifteenth N

) O

. O

I H
know O
that O
a O
transaction N
of O
this O
magnitude N
would O
make O
anyone O
apprehensive O
and O
worried O
. O

But O
I H
am O
assuring O
you H
that O
all O
will O
be O
well O

you H

Please O

this O
business N

is O
100 O

please O
contact O
our H

Let O
me H
add O
some O

You H

get O

, O

reasons N
why O
NASA O

important O

in O
a O
5th O

I H
guess O
if O
you H
are O
someone H
not O
familiar O
with O
how O
NASA O

our H
society N
I H
can O
see O
how O

form N
the O
opinion N

yheggy O

Let O
me H
put O
it O
this O
way N

If O
you H

then O
you H

somehow O

i H

there O

i H
also O

China's O
China O
's H
insatiable O
demand N
for O
energy N
is O
prompting O
fears N
of O
financial O
and O
diplomatic O
collisions N
around O
the O
globe N
as O
it O
seeks O
reliable O
supplies N
of O
oil N
from O
as O
far O
away O
as O
Brazil O
and O
Sudan O
. O

An O
intrusion N
into O
Japanese O
territorial O
waters N
by O
a O
Chinese O
nuclear O
submarine N
last O
week N
and O
a O
trade N
deal O
with O
Brazil O
are O
the O
latest O
apparently O
unconnected O
consequences N
of O
China's O
China O
's H
soaring O
economic O
growth N
. O

Increased O
car N
usage N
in O
China O
is O
creating O
a O
high O
demand N
for O
petrol N

The O
connection N
, O
however O
, O
lies N
in O
an O
order O
issued O
last O
year N
by O
President H
Hu H
Jintao O
to O
seek O
secure O
oil N
supplies N
abroad O
- O
preferably O
ones N
which O
could O
not O
be O
stopped O
by O
America O
in O
case N
of O
conflict N
over O
Taiwan O
. O

The O
submarine N
incident N
was O
put O
down O
to O
a O
" O
technical O
error N
" O
by O
the O
Chinese O
government N
, O
which O
apologised O
to O
Japan O
. O

But O
even O
before O
the O
incident N
the O
People's O
People N
's H
Daily O
, O
the O
government N
mouthpiece H
, O
had O
commented O
that O
competition N
over O
the O
East O
China O
Sea N
between O
the O
two O
countries N
was O
" O
only O
a O
prelude N
of O
the O
game N
between O
China O
and O
Japan O
in O
the O
arena N
of O
international O
energy N
" O
. O

The O
Brazil O
trade N
deal O
included O
funding N
for O
a O
joint O
oil N
- O
drilling O
and O
pipeline N
programme N
at O
a O
cost O
that O
experts H
said O
would O
add O
up O
to O
three O
times N
the O
cost O
of O
simply O
buying O
oil N
on O
the O
market N
. O

The O
West O
, O
however O
, O
has O
paid O
little O
attention N
to O
these O
developments N
. O

For O
the O
United O
States O
and O
Europe O
are O
far O
more O
concerned O
with O
the O
even O
more O
sensitive O
issues N
of O
China's O
China O
's H
relations N
with O
" O
pariah H
states N
" O
. O

In O
September O
, O
China O
threatened O
to O
veto O
any O
move O
to O
impose O
sanctions N
on O
Sudan O
over O
the O
atrocities N
in O
Darfur O
. O

It O
has O
invested O
$ O
3 O
billion O
in O
the O
African O
country's O
country N
's H
oil N
industry N
, O
which O
supplies N
it O
with O
seven O
per O
cent O
of O
its O
needs N
. O

Then O
, O
this O
month N
, O
it O
said O
that O
it O
opposed O
moves O
to O
refer O
Iran's O
Iran O
's H
nuclear O
stand O
- O
off O
with O
the O
International O
Atomic O
Energy N
Agency O
to O
the O
United O
Nations O
Security N
Council N
. O

A H
week N
before O
, O
China's O
China O
's H
second N
biggest O
state N
oil N
firm O
had O
signed O
a O
$ O
70 O
billion O
deal O
for O
oilfield N
and O
natural O
gas N
development N
with O
Iran O
, O
which O
already O
supplies N
13 O
per O
cent O
of O
China's O
China O
's H
needs N
. O

China O
has O
its O
own O
reserves N
of O
oil N
and O
natural O
gas N
and O
once O
was O
a O
net O
oil N
exporter H
. O

But O
as O
its O
economy N
has O
expanded O
by O
an O
average O
of O
nine O
per O
cent O
per O
year N
for O
the O
last O
two O
decades N
, O
so O
has O
its O
demand N
for O
energy N
. O

This O
year N
it O
overtook O
Japan O
as O
the O
world's O
world N
's H
second N
largest O
consumer H
of O
energy N
, O
behind O
the O
US O
. O

Its O
projected O
demand N
, O
boosted O
by O
a O
huge O
rise N
in O
car N
ownership N
as O
well O
as O
the O
need O
to O
find O
alternatives N
to O
polluting O
coal N
for O
electricity N
generation N
, O
has O
contributed O
to O
the O
surge N
in O
the O
price N
of O
oil N
this O
year N
. O

Shortages N
are O
already O
leading N
to O
power N
cuts O
in O
the O
big O
cities N
. O

Since O
President H
Hu H
ordered O
state N
- O
owned O
oil N
firms N
to O
" O
go O
abroad O
" O
to O
ensure O
supply N
, O
they O
have O
begun O
drilling O
for O
gas N
in O
the O
East O
China O
Sea N
, O
just O
west O
of O
the O
line N
that O
Japan O
regards O
as O
its O
border N
. O

Japan O
protested O
, O
to O
no O
avail N
, O
that O
the O
project N
should O
be O
a O
joint O
one N
. O

The O
two O
are O
also O
set O
to O
clash O
over O
Russia's O
Russia O
's H
oil N
wealth N
. O

China O
is O
furious O
that O
Japan O
has O
outbid O
it O
in O
their O
battle N
to O
determine O
the O
route N
of O
the O
pipeline N
that O
Russia O
intends O
to O
build O
to O
the O
Far O
East O
. O

Japan O
favoured O
a O
route N
to O
the O
sea N
, O
enabling O
oil N
to O
be O
shipped O
to O
both O
Japan O
and O
China O
. O

China O
wanted O
an O
overland O
route N
through O
its O
own O
territory N
, O
which O
would O
give O
it O
ultimate O
control N
if O
hostilities N
broke O
out O
. O

Increasingly O
, O
analysts H
are O
saying O
that O
China's O
China O
's H
efforts N
have O
gone O
beyond O
what O
is O
safe O
or O
even O
in O
its O
own O
interests N
. O

Claude H
Mandil O
, O
the O
executive O
director H
of O
the O
International O
Energy N
Agency O
in O
Paris O
, O
said O
the O
reserves N
in O
the O
East O
China O
Sea N
were O
hardly O
worth N
the O
trouble N
. O

" O
Nobody O
thinks O
that O
there O
will O
be O
a O
lot N
of O
oil N
and O

in O
this O
part N

political O
issue N

I H
don't O

such O
an O

the O
cost O
for O
the O

it O

up O
with O

three O
times N

, O
which O
, O
in O
my H

, O
appears O

meditation N

more O
than O
that O

Meditation N
has O
to O
do O
with O
what O
is O
called O
ideation N

It O
is O
always O
good O
to O
stick N
to O
a O

With O
each O
breath N

feel O
the O
muscles N
in O
your H
body N
becoming O
lighter O
and O
lighter O
, O
and O
also O
your H
external O
motor N
and O
sensory O
organs N
are O
feeling O
like O
they O
are O
withdrawing O
from O
the O
world N
into O
a O
special O
inner O
quietness N
. O

Imagine O
the O
tension N
melting N
away O
as O
you H
continue O
breathing N
rhythmically O
and O
naturally O
. O

Picture O
yourself H
sitting O
on O
a O
warm O
, O
tropical O
beach N
basking O
in O
the O
glow N
of O
the O
sun N
... O

colours N
of O
the O
earth N
( O
its O
flowers A
and O
plants A
) O
, O
the O
sea N
next O
to O
you H
, O
and O
the O
sky O
above O
you H
. O

Feel O
yourself H
floating O
above O
the O
earth N
and O
sea N
. O

As O
you H
sit O
above O
the O
world N
, O
the O
warmth N
of O
the O
golden O
sun N
penetrates O
your H
body N
and O
makes O
you H
feel O
warmer O
and O
warmer O
. O

It O
surrounds O
you H
. O

The O
golden O
rays N
feel O
soft O
and O
soothing O
. O

Now O
you H
are O
far O
above O
the O
earth N
- O
into O
space N
. O

Everything O
around O
you H
is O
so O
vast O
. O

Yet O
, O
there O
is O
warmth N
and O
a O
familiarity N
with O
the O
vastness N

You H
want O
to O
merge O
your H
mind N
with O
the O
greater O
universal O
Mind N
that O
surrounds O
you H

Continue O
to O
ideate O
on O
this O
intense O
desire N
for O
your H
mind N
to O
merge O
with O
the O
that O
universal O
Consciousness N

And O
while O
doing O
so O
continue O
using O
the O
Baba H
Nam O
Kevalam O
mantra N
( O
breathe O
in O
with O
Baba H
Nam O
, O
breathe O
out O
with O
Kevalam O
) O
. O

Try O
this O
for O
5 O
to O
10 O
minutes N
. O

Now O
come O
back O
to O
earth N
again O
- O
slowly O
. O

Imagine O
yourself H
sitting O
on O
the O
beach N
serenely O
and O
restfully O
. O

Your H
muscles N
are O
loose O
and O
limp O
. O

Feel O
your H
body N
sinking O
slightly O
into O
the O
sand N
making O
that O
earthly O
connection N
again O
. O

The O
sun's O
sun N

rays N
and O
warmth N
are O
still O
with O
you H

You H
are O

With O
each O
breath N
, O
watch O
your H
body N
and O
ensure O
that O
it O
remains O

Continue O
to O
feel O
the O
warmth N
of O
the O
sunlight N
all O
over O
your H
body N
, O
warming O
you H
deeply O
and O
gently O
. O

You H
want O
to O
bring O
something O
back O
with O
you H
from O
your H
deep O
space N
experience N
where O
you H
sensed O
your H
mind N
merging O
with O
the O
universal O
Mind N
. O

This O
will O
be O
the O
warmth N
of O
the O
sun N
- O
a O
close O
reminder N
and O
link N
between O
earth N
and O
the O
infinite O
space N
. O

Visualize O
the O
inside O
of O
your H
body N
bathed O
in O
the O
golden O
light N
, O
absorbing O
every O
ray N
and O
glowing O
as O
radiantly O
as O
the O
sun N

A H
warm O

gentle O
breeze N
swirls O
around O
your H
body N

relaxes O
you H
even O
more O

Let O
your H
mind N

body N
be O
totally O
at O
peace N

Now O
feel O
yourself H
returning O
to O
where O
you H
sit O
... O
move O
your H
hands N

feet N
a O
little O
, O
stretch O
them O
. O

Open O
your H

Mountain O
Visualization N

Another O
thing N
you H
can O
try O
. O

Imagine O
you're O
you H
're O
sitting O
on O
top N
of O
a O
mountain N
, O
and O
that O
it's O
it O
's H
the O
most O
peaceful O
place N
you H
can O
think O
of O
. O

Feel O
that O
you're O
you H
're O
sitting O
there O
in O
complete O
peace N
, O
right O
on O
top N
of O
the O
world N
. O

Now O
imagine O
that O
infinite O
happiness N
is O
surrounding O
you H
in O
every O
direction N
. O

Feel O
you're O
you H
're O
completely O
surrounded O
by O
that O
infinite O
peace N
and O
happiness N
. O

Now O
start O
to O
repeat O
within O
your H
mind N
the O
mantra N
: O
BABA N
NAM O
KEVALAM O
. O

Its O
meaning N
is O
" O
Infinite O
happiness N
is O
everywhere O
" O
. O

Feel O
the O
meaning N
, O
don't O
do O
n't O
just O
think O
of O
its O
wordy O
meaning N
or O
try O
to O
translate O
from O
Sanskrit O
( O
BABA N
NAM O
KEVALAM O
) O
to O
an O
English O
meaning N
( O
Infinite O
peace N
and O
happiness N
) O
. O

Think O
internally O
, O
intuitively O
, O
not O
by O
words N
, O
of O
the O
meaning N
, O
as O
you're O
you H
're O
repeating N
it O
. O

This O
is O
called O
ideation N
. O

It O
is O
important O
to O
take O
the O
idea N
, O
not O
just O
the O
intellectual O
analysis N
. O

Touching O
deep O
into O
the O
idea N
is O
what O
builds O
intuition N
- O
it O
is O
a O
synthetic O
process N
. O

Whereas O
, O
trying O
to O
translate O
and O
grapple O
with O
wordy O
meanings N
is O
an O
intellectual O
mechanism N
- O
an O
analytical O
process N
. O

Feel O
you're O
you H
're O
surrounded O
by O
infinite O
peace N
and O
happiness N
, O
and O
feel O
that O
your H
own O
sense N
of O
existence N
is O
in O
direct O
contact O
with O
that O
endless O
peace N
and O
happiness N
all O
around O
you H
. O

You H
can O
go O
further O
and O
feel O
that O
your H
unit N
consciousness N
, O
a O
dot N
in O
the O
Infinite O
Consciousness N
, O
is O
merging O
with O
Infinity N
. O

Continue O
for O
as O
long O
as O
you H
like O
, O
then O
open O
your H
eyes N
. O

OK O
that O
is O
fairly O
basic O
:) O
. O

The O
important O
point N
is O
to O
develop O
some O
psycho-spiritual O
connection N
between O
your H
mind N
and O
the O
universal O
Consciousness N
or O
Supreme O
Consciousness N
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
worry O
if O
you H
have O
trouble N
concentrating O
on O
the O
mantra N
and O
ideation N
- O
that's O
that O
's H
normal O
. O

It O
takes O
some O
time N
and O
practice O
to O
be O
able O
to O
focus O
on O
the O
one N
thought O
. O

The O

to O
keep O

If O
you H
don't O
do O

then O
nothing N

Well O
maybe O
a O

NORTH O
CAROLINA O
RELIGIOUS O
COALITION O
FOR O
MARRIAGE O
EQUALITY O

From O
what O
we H
hear O
from O
the O
news N
media N
, O
one N
could O
easily O
conclude O
that O
all O
Christians H
are O
opposed O
to O
gay O
marriage N
. O

But O
that’s O
that O
’s H
not O
the O
case N
. O

Last O
year N
an O
organization N
named O
the O
North H
Carolina O
Religious O
Coalition O
for O
Marriage N
Equality O
was O
formed O
to O
get O
out O
the O
message N
that O
at O
least O
some O
people N
of O
faith N
are O
not O
opposed O
to O
extending O
the O
rights N
and O
responsibilities N
of O
civil O
marriage N
to O
same O
- O
gender N
couples N
. O

One O
of O
“ O
NCRC4ME’s O
NCRC4ME O
’s H
” O
major O
efforts N
is O
to O
collect O
signatures N
for O
the O
attached O
“ O
Declaration O
of O
Religious O
Leaders H
, O
” O
which O
has O
been O
and O
will O
again O
be O
presented O
to O
members H
of O
the O
NC O
legislature N
. O

It O
presents O
the O
case N
for O
marriage N
equality N
and O
states N
, O
“ O
We H
are O
resolved O
that O
the O
State N
should O
not O
interfere O
with O
same O
- O
gender N
couples N
who O
choose O
to O
marry O
and O
share O
fully O
and O
equally O
in O
the O
rights N
, O
responsibilities N
, O
and O
commitments N
of O
civil O
marriage N
. O
” O

A H
measure N
to O
amend O
the O
NC O
Constitution O
to O
ban N
gay O
marriage N
was O
defeated O
last O
year N
but O
already O
has O
been O
reintroduced O
in O
the O
2005 O
legislative O
session N
, O
so O
there O
is O
a O
real O
need O
for O
visible O
support N
for O
the O
“ O
pro-same O
- O
gender N
- O
marriage N
” O
side N
of O

issue N

North H
Carolina O
Religious O
Coalition O
for O
Marriage N
Equality O
Declaration O
of O
Religious O
Leaders H
April O
19 O
, O
2004 O

The O
most O
fundamental O
human O
right O
, O
after O
the O
necessities N
of O
food N
, O
clothing N
and O
shelter N
, O
is O
the O
right O
to O
affection N
and O
the O
supportive O
love O
of O
other O
human O
beings A
. O

We H
become O
most O
fully O
human O
when O
we H
love O
another O
person H
. O

We H
can O
grow O
in O
our H
capacity N
to O
be O
human O
- O
to O
be O
loving O
- O
in O
a O
family H
unit N
. O

This O
right O
to O
love O
and O
form N
a O
family H
is O
so O
fundamental O
that O
our H
United O
States O
Constitution O
takes O
it O
for O
granted O
in O
its O
dedication N
to O
" O
secure O
the O
blessings N
of O
liberty N
to O
ourselves H
and O
our H
posterity A
. O
” O

The O
North H
Carolina O
Constitution O
likewise O
affirms O
the O
“ O
inalienable O
rights N
” O
of O
human O
beings A
to O
" O
life N
, O
liberty N
, O
the O
enjoyment N
of O
the O
fruits N
of O
their O
own O
labor N
, O
and O
the O
pursuit N
of O
happiness N
. O
" O

Throughout O
history N
, O
tyrants H
have O
known O
that O
by O
denying O
the O
right O
of O
oppressed O
peoples N
to O
form N
and O
nurture N
families N
, O
they O
can O
kill O
the O
spirit N
of O
those O
peoples N
. O

> O
From O
the O
shameful O
history N
of O
slavery N
in O
America O
, O
the O
injustice N
of O
forbidding O
people N
to O
marry O
is O
evident O
as O
a O
denial N
of O
a O
basic O
human O
right O
. O

The O
American O
laws N
forbidding O
interracial O
marriage N
, O
now O
struck O
down O
, O
were O
clearly O
discriminatory O
. O

Denial N
of O
the O
status N
of O
marriage N
to O
those O
who O
would O
freely O
accept O
its O
responsibilities N
creates O
legal O
and O
economic O
inequities N
and O
social O
injustice N
. O

We H
feel O
called O
to O
protest N
and O
oppose O
this O
injustice N
. O

As O
religious O
people N
, O
clergy N
and O
lay O
leaders H
, O
we H
are O
mandated O
by O
faith N
to O
stand O
for O
justice N
in O
our H
common O
civic O
life N
. O

We H
oppose O
the O
use H
of O
sacred O
texts N
and O
religious O
traditions N
to O
deny O
legal O
equity N
to O
same O
- O
gender N
couples N
. O

As O
concerned O
citizens H
we H
affirm O
the O
liberty N
of O
adults H
of O
the O
same O
gender N
to O
love O
and O
marry O
. O

We H
insist O
that O
no O
one N
, O
especially O
the O
state N
, O
is O
allowed O
to O
coerce O
people N
into O
marriage N
or O
bar N
two O
consenting O
adults H
, O
whether O
of O
the O
same O
or O
differing O
genders N
, O
from O
forming O
the O
family H
unit N
that O
lets O
them O
be O
more O
fully O
loving O
, O
thus O
more O
fully O
human O
. O

We H
respect N
the O
fact N
that O
debate N
and O
discussion N
continue O
in O
many O
of O
our H
religious O
communities N
as O
to O
the O
scriptural O
, O
theological O
and O
liturgical O
issues N
involved O
. O

However O
, O
we H
draw O
on O
our H
many O
faith N
traditions N
to O
arrive O
at O
a O
common O
conviction N
. O

We H
are O
resolved O
that O
the O
State N
should O
not O
interfere O
with O
same O
- O
gender N
couples N
who O
choose O
to O
marry O
and O
share O
fully O
and O
equally O
in O
the O
rights N
, O
responsibilities N
, O
and O
commitments N
of O
civil O
marriage N
. O

We H
affirm O
freedom N
of O
conscience N
in O
this O
matter N
. O

We H
recognize O
that O
the O
state N
may O
not O
require O
religious O
groups N
to O
officiate O
at O
, O
or O
bless O
, O
same O
- O
gender N
marriages N
. O

Likewise O
, O
a O
denial N
of O
state N
civil O
recognition N
dishonors O
the O
religious O
convictions N
of O
those O
communities N
and O
clergy N
who O
officiate O
at O
, O
and O
bless O
, O
same O
- O
gender N
marriages N
. O

The O
state N
may O
not O
favor N
the O
convictions N
of O
one N
religious O
group N
over O
another O
by O
denying O
individuals H
their O
fundamental O
right O
to O
marry O
and O
to O
have O
those O
marriages N
recognized O
by O
civil O
law N
. O

As O
faith N
leaders H
, O
we H
commit O
ourselves H
to O
public O
action N
, O
visibility N
, O
education N
, O
and O
mutual O
support N
in O
the O
service N
of O
the O
right O
and O
freedom N
to O
marry O
. O

The O
One O
Reason N
Why O
All O
Americans O
Should O
Oppose O
The O
Nomination N
Of O
Samuel H
Alito O

He O
Would O
Tear O
Down O
Our H
System O
Of O
Checks N
And O
Balances N
, O
Giving O
Far O
Too O
Much O
Power N
To O
The O
President H

My H
Fellow H
Americans O
: O

As O
many O
of O
you H
may O
have O
heard O
, O
President H
Bush H
has O
nominated O
a O
long O
- O
time N
Federal O
Judge O
named O
Samuel H
Alito O
to O
become O
the O
next O
member N
of O
the O
United O
States O
Supreme O
Court N
, O
to O
fill O
a O
vacancy N
created O
by O
the O
retirement N
of O
another O
member N
of O
the O
Court N
. O

Under O
our H
Constitution O
, O
this O
nomination N
cannot O
can O
not O
take O
effect N
unless O
and O
until O
the O
United O
States O
Senate O
gives O
its O
Consent N
, O
as O
described O
in O
our H
Constitution O
, O
Article N
II O
, O
Section N
2 O
. O

A H

of O
the O
Constitution O
, O

to O
the O
official O

http://loveallpeople.org/usconstitutiona.txt O

Judge O
Samuel H
Alito O
is O
very O
highly O
qualified O
by O
all O
of O
the O
normal O
standards N
used O
to O
evaluate O
candidates H
for O
this O
position N
: O

He O
has O
a O
very O
high O
intellect N
. O

He O
graduated O
very O
high O
in O
his O
class N
, O
from O
Princeton O
undergraduate O
and O
from O
Law O
School N
at O
Yale O
. O

He O
has O
a O
long O
and O
distinguished O
record N
, O
including O
many O
years N
as O
a O
Federal O
Appeals N
Judge O
, O
the O
next O
level N
below O
Supreme O
Court N
. O

He O
has O
encyclopedic O
knowledge N
of O
hundreds N
of O
different O
Supreme O
Court N
cases N
, O
and O
he O
can O
recite O
details N
from O
memory N
. O

He O
demonstrates O
an O
excellent O
" O
Judicial O
Temperament N
, O
" O
being O
courteous O
, O
mild O
- O
mannered O
, O
respectful O
of O
all O
people N
; O
careful O
in O
his O
work N
, O
meticulous O
in O
detail N
. O

His O
co-workers H
love O
him O
. O

His O
fellow H
judges H
love O
him O
. O

His O
family H
loves O
him O
. O

President H
Bush H
loves O
him O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
is O
true O
that O
some O
people N
don't O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
way N
they O
think O
he O
will O
vote N
on O
the O
Supreme O
Court N
. O

But O
other O
people N
do O
like O
the O
way N
they O
think O
he O
will O
vote N
, O
and O
the O
ones N
who O
favor N
him O
seem O
to O
outnumber O
the O
ones N
who O
oppose O
him O
. O

So O
now O
the O
Senate O
is O
getting O
ready O
to O
vote N
soon O
, O
on O
whether O
to O
approve O
him O
or O
not O
; O
and O
at O
this O
moment N
( O
evening N
of O
Jan. O
27 O
, O
2006 O
) O
it O
looks O
like O
he O
has O
more O
than O
the O
fifty O
- O
one N
votes N
needed O
for O
approval N
. O

The O
President H
is O
very O
eager O
to O
go O
ahead O
quickly O
and O
get O
this O
vote N
, O
because O
he O
very O
much O
wants O
to O
have O
Samuel H
Alito O
on O
the O
Supreme O
Court N
, O
to O
be O
judging O
the O
cases N
Bush H
is O
interested O
in O
. O

So O
there O
is O
a O
lot N
of O
hurry N
- O
up O
pressure O
on O
the O
Senate O
to O
give O
its O
prompt O
vote N
of O
approval N
. O

There O
is O
an O
old O
saying O
that O
applies O
in O
this O
situation N
: O
" O
Act O
in O
haste N
, O
repent O
at O
leisure N
. O
" O

Sometimes O
you H
can O
make O
a O
bad O
decision N
very O
quickly O
, O
then O
regret O
it O
for O
many O
years N
to O
come O
. O

That O
is O
what O
is O
about O
to O
happen O
with O
Judge O
Samuel H
Alito O
, O
in O
my H
opinion N
, O
because O
he O
has O
one N
tragic O
flaw N
- O
a O
very O
serious O
blind O
spot N
in O
his O
thinking O
- O
which O
makes O
him O
completely O
unacceptable O
for O
the O
position N
of O
Supreme O
Court N
Justice H
: O
He O
does O
not O
really O
agree O
with O
the O
system N
of O
" O
Checks N
and O
Balances N
" O
built O
into O
the O
Constitution O
, O
and O
he O
is O
ready O
to O
start O
tearing O
it O
down O
in O
order O
to O
follow O
the O
" O
Unitary O
Executive O
Theory O
, O
" O
which O
calls O
for O
vastly O
- O
increased O
Presidential O
Power N
at O
the O
expense N
of O
Congress N
and O
the O
Supreme O
Court N
. O

And O
because O
of O
this O
tragic O
flaw N
. O
. O
. O

" O
He O
Would O
Tear O
Down O
Our H
System O
Of O
Checks N
And O
Balances N
, O
Giving O
Far O
Too O
Much O
Power N
To O
The O
President H
. O
" O

In O
our H
Constitutional O
system N
, O
we H
have O
three O
branches N
of O
the O
Federal O
Government O
: O
the O
Legislative O
, O
Executive O
, O
and O
Judicial O
branches N
. O

And O
the O
basic O
idea N
behind O
the O
Checks N
and O
Balances N
we H
have O
is O
that O
if O
one N
branch N
of O
the O
Government O
goes O
crazy O
, O
the O
other O
two O
can O
hold O
it O
down O
. O

But O
Samuel H
Alito O
believes O
in O
a O
little O
- O
known O
Constitutional O
theory N
- O
called O
the O
" O
Unitary O
Executive O
Theory O
" O
- O
which O
says O
that O
the O
President H
should O
have O
complete O
control N
over O
the O
Executive O
Branch N
, O
and O
that O
the O
Executive O
Branch N
should O
be O
in O
charge O
of O
almost O
everything O
that O
the O
Government O
actually O
does O
, O
including O
the O
functions N
of O
the O
Independent O
Agencies N
which O
were O
designed O
to O
be O
free O
of O
Presidential O
control N
, O
and O
the O
Military O
, O
which O
exists O
, O
which O
is O
regulated O
, O
and O
which O
is O
funded O
by O
specific O
authority N
given O
by O
the O
Constitution O
to O
Congress N
, O
not O
to O
the O
President H
. O

The O
Military O
is O
not O
part N
of O
the O
Executive O
Branch N
: O
it O
is O
a O
separate O
entity N
. O

" O
Commander O
In O
Chief O
" O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
mean O
that O
he O
is O
the O
boss A
of O
the O
Military O
, O
merely O
mean O
that O
he O
is O
the O
Administrator O
, O
just O
as O
he O
is O
the O
Administrator O
of O
the O
Executive O
Branch N
, O
charged O
with O
" O
executing O
faithfully O
" O
all O
the O
laws N
passed O
by O
Congress N
and O
all O
the O
Decisions N
rendered O
by O
the O
Supreme O
Court N
. O

Under O
the O
Unitary O
Executive O
Theory O
, O
the O
Laws O
of O
Congress N
and O
Decisions N
of O
the O
Supreme O
Court N
have O
no O
actual O
authority N
unless O
the O
President H
agrees O
with O
them O
. O

And O
so O
Congress N
and O
the O
Supreme O
Court N
become O
mere O
advisors H
to O
the O
President H
, O
with O
no O
real O
authority N
over O
him O
. O

And O
the O
President H
becomes O
a O
Dictator H
, O
unrestrained O
by O
anything O
in O
the O
Constitution O
, O
backed O
up O
by O
the O
Armed O
Forces O
, O
which O
would O
be O
entirely O
under O
his O
personal O
control N
. O

And O
thus O
the O
United O
States O
of O
America O
- O
The O
Land N
Of O
The O
Free O
And O
The O
Home O
Of O
The O
Brave O
- O
becomes O
just O
another O
Military O
Dictatorship N
, O
no O
better O
than O
Nazi O
Germany H
or O
Fascist O
Italy O
during O
World N
War N

phase N
Chinese O
space N
initiative N
, O
Johnson H

Freese O
said O

The O
first O
phase N
, O
she O
said O
, O
will O
demonstrate O
the O
capability N
of O
a O
multi-compartment O
spacecraft N
that O
will O
leave O

The O

The O
final O
phase N
will O
feature N
the O
assembly N
and O
operation N
of O
a O
longer O

duration N
space N
lab N
. O

At O
least O
one N
expert H
believes O
China's O
China O
's H
intentions N
might O
include O
a O
surprise O
attempt N
to O
circle N
the O
moon N
with O
astronauts H
before O
NASA's O
NASA O
's H
planned O
lunar O
return O
. O

" O
The O
Americans O
would O
be O
wise O
to O
plan N
accordingly O
, O
" O
said O
John H
E. O
Pike H
, O
director H
of O
the O
Alexandria O
, O
Va. O
- O
based O
GlobalSecurity.org O
, O
a O
small O
national O
security N
think O
tank N

" O
There O
is O
always O
the O
possibility N
they O
could O
jam N
us H
up O
, O
make O
us H
look O
like O
we H
are O
not O
numero O
uno O
, O
" O
Pike H
said O
. O

During O
the O
U.S. O
and O
Russian O
lunar O
race N
during O
the O
Cold O
War N
, O
NASA O
scored O
an O
early O
coup O
by O
circling O
the O
moon N
with O
the O
Apollo O
8 O
crew N
over O
the O
1968 O
Christmas O
holidays N
. O

As O
it O
turned O
out O
, O
the O
Soviets O
never O
made O
it O
to O
the O
moon N
. O

" O
( O
China O
) O
could O
be O
the O
second N
country N
to O
do O
that O
, O
" O
Pike H
said O
. O

" O
They O
would O
get O
in O
line N
in O
front N
of O
the O
Russians O
. O

And O
they O
would O
not O
have O
to O
land O
on O
the O
moon N
to O
take O
us H
down O
a O
notch N
. O
" O

Pike's O
Pike H
's H
concern N
is O
based O
on O
China's O
China O
's H
development N
of O
a O
new O
medium N
- O
lift O
rocket N
, O
the O
Long O
March O
V N
, O
and O
the O
construction N
of O
a O
new O
space N
launch N
complex O
on O
Hainan O
Island O
in O
the O
South O
China O
Sea N
. O

The O
two O
developments N
, O
he O
said O
, O
could O
eventually O
enable O
China's O
China O
's H
space N
program N
to O
mature O
to O
the O
point N
that O
experts H
could O
assemble O
and O
launch N
from O
Earth's O
Earth O

orbit N
a O
spacecraft N
capable O
of O
circling O
the O

horrific O
nightmare N

go O

by O
sick O

who O
put O
them O

heat N
the O
inside O

the O
sheds N
up O
to O
110 O
degrees N
with O
fires N

so O
that O
they O
can O
periodically O
scrape O
the O
sweat O
off O

their O
genitals N
and O
sell O
it O
to O
corrupt O
corporations N
who O
use H
it O
to O
prolong O
the O
scent N
of O
perfumes N
. O

The O
animals A
eventually O
die O
, O
which O
is O
because O
these O
demons A
are O
so O
GREEDY O
, O
they O
want O
as O
much O
of O
their O
" O
product N
" O
as O
they O
can O
get O
, O
instead O
of O
letting O
the O

as O
an O
act N

Hi O
there O
, O

I H
read O
the O
Civet A
Cat A
story N
from O
a O
little O
while O
ago O
, O
and O
tonight N
, O
when O
my H
Mom H
emailed O
me H
about O
it O
, O
I H
re-read O
it O
, O
and O
went O
to O
the O

the O
song N

Well O
, O
sure O
enough O
, O
when O
I H
heard O
the O
cats A
" O
Meowing O
, O
" O
I H
imagined O
the O
hellish O
moments N
these O
poor O
beautiful O
creatures A
of O
God H
were O
living O
, O
what O
went O
on O
in O
their O
tiny O
, O
sweet O
little O
minds N
, O
and O
decided O
that O
I H
want O
to O
do O
something O
about O
this O
torture N
. O

So O
, O
if O
anyone O
can O
give O
me H
some O
advice N
, O
I'd O
I H
'd O
sure O
appreciate O
it O
! O

I H
think O
for O
starters H
, O
myself H
and O
those O
of O
you H
who O
believe O
in O
God H
could O
say O
a O
special O
prayer N
for O
them O
. O

I H
will O
. O

I've O
I H
've O
pasted O
the O
email N
for O
those O
who O
haven't O
have O
n't O
seen O
or O
would O
like O
to O
re-read O
it O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
also O
got O
the O
website N
where O
the O
song N
has O
been O
uploaded O
. O

I H
was O
thinking O
, O
that O
while O
I'm O
I H
'm O
sitting O
here O
, O
relaxing O
and O
enjoying O
myself H
, O
those O
poor O
innocent O
animals A
are O
being O
cooked O
to O
death N
with O
heat N
in O
those O
Holocaust-esque O
death N
chambers N

And O
what O
am O
I H
DOING O
about O
it O
? O

I H
feel O
somewhat O

I H
think O
it O

fitting O
because O
it O

directly O

a O

it O

very O
good O
article N
which O
no O

can O

and O
not O
sense N
their O

hypocrisy N

But O
this O
is O
what O
he O
says O
about O
civet A
cats A
: O

" O
As O
an O
example N
, O
consider O
the O
treatment N
of O
the O
civet A
cat A
, O
a O
highly O
intelligent O
and O
sociable O
animal A
. O

Civet A
cats A
are O
trapped O
and O
placed O
in O
small O
cages N
inside O
darkened O
sheds N
, O
where O
the O
temperature N
is O
kept O
up O
to O
110 O
F O
by O
fires N
. O

They O
are O
confined O
in O
this O
way N
until O
they O
finally O
die O
. O

What O
justifies O
this O
extraordinary O
mistreatment N
? O

These O
animals A
have O
the O
misfortune N
to O
produce O
a O
substance N
that O
is O
useful O
in O
the O
manufacture O
of O
perfume N
. O

Musk N
, O
which O
is O
scraped O
from O
their O
genitals N
once O
a O

for O
as O
long O
as O
they O
can O
surv O
ive O
, O
makes O
the O
scent N
of O

last O
a O
bit N
longer O
after O

application N

I'd O
I H
'd O
appreciate O
it O

I H
also O
hope O
no O

any O

THIS O

NOT O
A H
SCAM N

I H
found O
this O
on O
a O
bulletin N

decided O
to O
try O
it O
: O
I H
don't O

I H
figured O

would O
end N
soon O
, O
but O
the O
money N
just O
kept O
coming O
in O
. O

In O
my H
first O

a O
total N

it O

worth N

spent O

You H
will O
now O
become O
a O
part N
of O
the O
Mail O
Order N
business N
. O

You H
are O
in O
the O
business N
of O
developing O
Mailing N
Lists N
. O

Many O
large O
corporations N
are O
happy O
to O
pay O
big O
bucks N
for O
quality N
lists O
. O

However O
, O
the O
money N
made O
from O
the O
mailing O
lists O
is O
secondary O
to O
income N
which O
is O
made O
from O
people N
like O
you H
and O
me H
asking O
to O
be O
included O
in O
that O
list N
. O

Here O
are O
the O
four O
easy O
steps N
to O
success N
. O

STEP N
ONE O
: O

Get O
six O
separate O
pieces N
of O
paper N
and O
write O
the O
following O
on O
each O
piece N
of O
paper N
" O
PLEASE O
PUT O
ME H
ON O
YOUR H
MAILING N
LIST N
. O
" O

Now O
get O
6 O
U.S. O
$ O
1.00 O
bills N
and O
place N
ONE O
inside O
of O
EACH O
of O
the O
six O
pieces N
of O
paper N
so O
the O
bill N
will O
not O
be O
seen O
through O
the O
envelope N
( O
to O
prevent O
thievery N
) O
. O

Next O
, O
place N
one N
paper N
in O
each O
of O
the O
six O
envelopes N
and O
seal O
them O
. O

You H
now O
should O
have O
six O
sealed O
envelopes N
, O
each O
with O
a O
piece N
of O
paper N
stating O
the O
above O
phrase N
, O
your H
name N
and O
address N
, O
and O
a O
$ O
1.00 O
bill N
. O

What O
you H
are O
doing O
is O
creating O
a O
service N
. O

THIS O
IS O
ABSOLUTELY O
LEGAL O
!!!! O
! O

You H
are O
requesting O
a O
legitimate O
service N
and O
you H
are O
paying O
for O
it O
!! O

Like O
most O
of O
us H
I H
was O
a O
little O
skeptical O
and O
little O
worried O
about O
the O
legal O
aspects N
of O
it O
all O
. O

So O
I H
checked O
it O
out O
with O
the O
U.S. O
Post O
Office O
( O
1-800-238-5355 O
) O
and O
they O
confirmed O
that O
it O
is O
indeed O
legal O
!! O

I H

) O

All O
you H
need O
is O
200 O
, O
but O
remember O
, O
the O
more O
you H
post N
, O
the O
more O
money N
you H
make O
!! O

This O

perfectly O
legal O

Title N
18 O

of O
these O
steps N
for O
yourself H
and O
whenever O
you H
need O
money N
, O
you H
can O
use H
it O
again O
, O
and O
again O
. O

PLEASE O
REMEMBER O
that O
this O
program N
remains O
successful O

of O
the O
honesty N

it O
this O

If O
you H
were O
of O
integrity N
, O
the O
program N
will O
continue O
and O
the O
money N
that O
so O
many O
others O
have O
received O
will O
come O
your H
way N
. O

NOTE N
: O
You H
may O
want O
to O
retain O
every O

, O
either O

This O
VERIFIES O
that O
you H

( O
Also O
, O
it O
might O
be O
a O
good O
idea N

Their O
sheep A
could O
graze O
, O
their O
cows A
could O
ruminate O
and O
never O
a O
discouraging O
word N
would O
be O
heard O
. O

After O
the O
major O
kill O
- O
offs O
, O
wolves A
outside O
of O
Alaska O
and O
Canada O
existed O
mostly O
as O
legend N
. O

Like O
UFOs N
or O
Sasquatch O
, O
several O
people N
claimed O
to O
see O
fleeting O
lone O
wolves A
, O
usually O
in O
Yellowstone O
. O

In O
the O
1960s N
, O
a O
group N
shooting N
a O
movie N
in O
the O
Wyoming O
park N
reportedly O
imported O
some O
captive O
wolves A
, O
then O
released O
them O
when O
their O
shooting N
was O
done O
. O

If O
so O
, O
this O
happy O
band N
has O
not O
been O
heard O
from O
since O
. O

Rumor N
also O
had O
it O
some O
renegade O
biologist H
brought O
a O
caged O
pair N
to O
Yellowstone O
and O
released O
them O
into O
the O
wild O
sometime O
in O
the O
1970s N
, O
hoping O
to O
reestablish O
a O
breeding O
population N
. O

If O
true O
, O
the O
caper N
failed O
. O

Over O
time N
, O
the O
wolf's O
wolf A
's H
absence N
seemed O
to O
rehabilitate O
its O
image N
. O

Eventually O
, O
a O
trickle N
of O
support N
appeared O
for O
bringing O
the O
predator A
back O
to O
its O
former O
home N
range N
in O
the O
northern O
Rocky O
Mountains O
. O

This O
trickle N
grew O
into O
a O
flood N
, O
resulting O
in O
14 O
wolves A
being O
reintroduced O
in O
Yellowstone O
in O
1995 O
by O
the O
U.S. O
Fish O
and O
Wildlife O
Service O
-- O
albeit O
over O
the O
strong O
and O
still O
- O
continuing O
objections N
of O
ranchers H
. O

These O
wolf A
packs A
have O
flourished O
, O
and O
now O
there O
are O
an O
estimated O
850 O
wolves A
roaming O
the O
northern O
Rockies O
, O
where O
merely O
10 O
years N
ago O
there O
were O
none N
. O

One O
compelling O
argument N
for O
reintroduction N
was O
the O
wolf A
acts N
as O
a O
keystone N
predator A
, O
an O
animal A
that O
affects O
the O
populations N
, O
behavior N
and O
ecology N
of O
a O
wide O
variety N
of O
species A
within O
its O
range N
. O

Some O
recent O
research N
conducted O
by O
Oregon O
State N
University N
has O
given O
considerable O
credence N
to O
this O
idea N
. O

OSU O
forestry N
professors H
William H
Ripple O
and O
Robert H
Beschta O
have O
found O
that O
wolves A
actually O
promote O
stream O
- O
bank N
stabilization N
, O
although O
they O
have O
given O
the O
phenomenon N
the O
unfortunate O
name N
of O
" O
the O
ecology N
of O
fear N
" O
-- O
something O
that O
smacks O
of O
the O
horrible O
PR N
resulting O
from O
the O
wolf's O
wolf A
's H
relationships N
with O
Riding H
Hood H
and O
the O
Three O
Pigs O
. O

They O
explained O
that O
elk A
in O
Yellowstone O
used O
to O
browse N
unmolested O
on O
young O
aspen A
and O
willow A
growing O
near O
the O
banks N
of O
streams N
, O
a O
behavior N
that O
prevented O
the O
saplings A
from O
reaching O
mature O
stages N
and O
increased O
the O
possibility N
of O
soil N
erosion N
. O

Since O
reintroduction N
, O
however O
, O
Ripple O
and O
Beschta O
have O
found O
, O
fear N
of O
the O
wolves A
apparently O
has O
discouraged O
the O
elk A
from O
spending N
too O
much O
time N
at O
stream O
banks N
-- O
where O
they O
are O
out O
in O
the O
open O
-- O
and O
munching O
on O
the O
saplings A
. O

" O
All O
you H
have O
to O
do O
is O
look O
at O
the O
photographs N

This O
simple O
change O
has O
triggered O
a O
veritable O
ecological O
cascade N
in O
Yellowstone O

More O

very O
much O
since O

Wolf O
reintroduction N
in O
the O
northern O

has O
been O
so O
successful O
the O
Fish O

has O
moved O
to O
reduce O

, O
eventually O

to O

established O

in O
the O
northern O

, O
as O
required O

of O
the O
wolf's O
wolf A

its O

" O

There O

only O
about O

eat O
more O

They O
even O
occasionally O
attack N

which O

do O
not O
-- O
despite O
the O

willing O

It O
remains O
to O
be O

whether O
they O
will O
extend O
the O

Regarding O
those O
rumors N
about O

According O

Parmesan's O
Parmesan N

one N

when O

prematurely O
, O
relying O

then O

" O

As O
the O
Pew O

" O
Sufficient O

conclude O
that O
the O

" O

Such O

contraction N

changes N
in O

The O
report N
also O
found O
alterations N

ecosystem N
processes N
such O
as O
carbon N

The O

" O
The O
impacts N

affecting O

Arctic O
, O
" O
said O
ACIA O
chair N
Robert H
Corell O

" O
The O
Arctic O
is O
experiencing O
some O
of O
the O
most O
rapid O
and O
severe O
climate N
change O
on O
Earth O
. O

The O
impacts N
of O
climate N
change O
on O
the O
region N
and O
the O
globe N
are O
projected O
to O
increase O
substantially O
in O
the O
years N
to O
come O
. O
" O

The O
ACIA O
found O
Arctic O
winter N
temperatures N
have O
increased O
4 O
degrees N
to O
7 O
degrees N
Fahrenheit O
in O
the O
last O
50 O
years N
and O
should O
go O
up O
about O
twice O
that O
much O
in O
the O
next O
100 O
years N
. O

Arctic O
summer N
sea N
ice N
will O
decline N
by O
50 O
percent N
by O
the O
end N
of O
the O
21st O
century N
, O
the O
assessment N
found O
, O
with O
some O
models N
predicting O
complete O
disappearance N
of O
summer N
sea N
ice N
. O

" O
Should O
the O
Arctic O
Ocean O
become O
ice N
- O
free O
in O
summer N
, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
polar O
bears A
and O
some O
seal O
species A
would O
be O
driven O
toward O
extinction N
, O
" O
the O
report N
concluded O
. O

As O
with O
so O
much O
climate N
research N
, O
not O
everyone O
agrees O
with O
these O
dire O
predictions N

A H
third O

" O
The O

Change N
: O
An O
Appraisal O
for O
the O

released O
almost O
simultaneously O
with O
the O
other O
two O
, O
falls O
somewhat O
into O
that O
category N
. O

On O
the O
one N
hand N
, O
the O
IPN O
report N
agreed O
" O
Climate N
models N
generally O
predict O
that O
the O
temperature N
rises O
in O
the O
Arctic O
will O
substantially O
exceed O
the O
global O
rise N
. O

This O
applies O
especially O
in O
the O
high O
Arctic O
where O
the O
ice N
cover O
is O
expected O
to O
diminish O
substantially O
with O
the O
effect N
that O
the O
surface N
absorption N
of O
solar O
radiation N
will O
greatly O
increase O
. O
" O

On O
the O
other O
hand N
, O
the O
report N
thinks O
the O
news N
might O
not O
be O
so O
bad O
for O
the O
North H
Atlantic O
fisheries N
. O

" O
The O
impact N
of O
global O
warming O
on O
fish A
stocks N
and O
fisheries N
is O
hard O
to O
judge H
, O
" O
the O
IPN O
report N
said O
. O

" O
A H
warming O
of O
the O
magnitude N
predicted O
is O
more O
likely O
than O
not O
to O
be O
beneficial O
to O
the O
fisheries N
of O
the O
North H
Atlantic O
. O
" O

The O
important O
commercial O
species A
that O
probably O
would O
benefit N
from O
warming O
include O
cod O
, O
haddock N
, O
saithe O
, O
herring N
, O
blue O
whiting N
and O
several O
types N
of O
flatfish N
and O
crustaceans A
-- O
such O
as O
the O
Norway O
lobster N
. O

Important O
species A
that O
probably O
would O
decline N
include O
shrimp N
, O
capelin A
, O
Greenland O
halibut N

some O
varieties N

Hidden O
in O
this O
laundry N
list N

and O
in O
the O
pile N
of O
studies N
examined O
by O
the O
Pew O

-- O
is O
one N
of O
the O
fundamental O
chasms N
dividing O
participants H
in O
the O
global O
warming O
debate N
. O

The O
IPN O
report N
examines O
commercial O
fish A
species A
, O
but O
it O
neglects O
important O
non-commercial O
animals A
, O
such O
as O
seals A
and O
polar O
bears A
. O

In O
a O
limited O
economic O
sense N
, O
therefore O
, O
the O
organization N
can O
argue O
warming O
might O
be O
a O
good O
thing N
. O

The O
problem N
is O
whether O
one N
cares O
what O
happens O
to O
the O
polar O
bears A
, O
checkerspot O
butterflies A
and O
other O
unconsumables O
. O

The O
Pew O
researchers H
tried O
to O
transcend O
the O
economic O
argument N
. O

They O
assumed O
a O
value N
-- O
unspecified O
-- O
for O
non-commercial O
species A
, O
and O
in O
doing O
so O
rendered O
the O
warming O
news N
a O
bit N
less O
rosy O
. O

This O
tug N
- O
of O
- O
war N
over O
calculating O
economic O
values N
is O
the O
one N
that O
ultimately O
will O
have O
to O
be O
decided O
by O
humans A
, O
because O
animals A
and O
plants A
can O
adjust O
only O
so O
much O

As O

this O
opportunity N

all O

that O

using O
this O
disaster N
as O
their O
podium N
to O
spread O
their O
useless O
opinions N

What O
you H
see O
in O
New H

a O
perfect O
example N

the O
downfalls N

the O

a O
form N

plain O

that O

The O
countries N
which O
are O
giving O
to O

to O
aid N
are O
a O
great O
example N
of O
the O
seed N
that O
America O

sown O
through O
the O
years N

other O

Now O
to O
the O
poverty N
stricken O
and O
the O
racial O
issue N
... O

You H
know O
, O
I've O
I H
've O
lived O
in O
the O
Dallas O
/ O
Fort O
Worth O
Metroplex O
most O
of O
my H
life N
. O

When O
not O
in O
Texas O
, O
I H
lived O
in O
LA O
and O
San O
Francisco H
. O

There O
is O
a O
lot N
of O
racial O
diversity N
in O
all O
of O
these O
places N
... O
and O
I've O
I H
've O
vacationed O
through O
the O
south O
... O
visited O
my H
folks N
when O
they O
lived O
in O
Mississippi O
, O
and O
where O
they O
live O
now O
and O
are O
in O
the O
racial O
minority N
being O
white O
( O
less O
than O
20 O
% O
) O
in O
northeastern O
Arkansas O
. O

The O
fact N
is O
, O
when O
I H
began O
traveling O
for O
business N
to O
New H
England O
, O
when O
I H
first O
visited O
my H
in O
- O
laws N
in O
Montana O
and O
Idaho O
, O
I H
was O
shocked O
at O
the O
lack N
of O
racial O
diversity N
. O

I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
expect O
to O
react O
that O
way N
, O
but O
when O
I H
was O
looking O
around O
my H
workplace N
in O
Nashua O
, O
New H
Hampshire O
, O
and O
everyone O
else O
looked O
pretty O
much O
like O
me H
, O
it O
was O
really O
very O
eerie O
. O

So O
, O
yes O
, O
America O
has O
pockets N
that O
are O
more O
diverse O
than O
others O
. O

Additionally O
, O
reviewing O
the O
standings N
of O
Louisiana O
and O
Mississippi O
in O
the O
educational O
stakes N
, O
you'll O
you H
'll O
find O
they O
usually O
land O
near O
the O
bottom N
of O
a O
list N
of O
50 O
states N
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
those O
left O
behind O
to O
be O
filmed O
, O
where O
those O
without O
transportation N
or O
means N
. O

Some O
refused O
to O
leave O
, O
but O
so O
many O
were O
unable O
to O
. O

Yes O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
a O
valid O
reflection N
of O
America O
- O
we H
do O
have O
cities N
like O
this O
. O

However O
, O
New H
Orleans O
also O
had O
many O
affluent O
people N
, O
people N
who O
left O
town N
early O
as O
they O
had O
the O
means N
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
this O
will O
change O
other O
nation's O
nation N
's H
perceptions N
of O
America O
. O

I H
suspect O
it O
will O
not O
change O
greatly O
... O
but O
you H
never O
know O
how O
much O
stock N
people N
put O
in O
the O
news N
. O

I H
do O
know O
that O
this O
will O
change O
the O
face N
of O
America O
. O

I H
expect O
that O
many O
of O
the O
displaced O
people N
( O
those O
affluent O
and O
those O
not O
) O
will O
remain O
in O
the O
places N
they O
were O
evacuated O
to O
. O

The O
1.25 O
million O
people N
who O
have O
been O
housed O
in O
stadiums N
and O
convention N
centers N
across O
Texas O
will O
begin O
to O
populate O
Houston O
, O
Dallas O
, O
San O
Antonio H
and O
Galveston O
, O
and O
the O
surrounding O
areas N
. O

Sure O
, O
some O
will O
return O
, O
but O
I H
have O
a O
feeling O
that O
once O
many O
begin O
to O
get O
jobs N
and O
temporary O
housing N
, O
they O
may O
be O
shy O
about O
returning O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
interested O
in O
what O
America O
will O
look O
like O
in O
5 O
years N
. O

Will O
racial O
diversity N
find O
its O
way N
to O
Wyoming O

some O

there O
? O

Or O
will O
the O
nearly O

round O
snow N
be O
too O
much O
for O
those O
who O
have O
never O
experienced O
snow N
in O
their O

? O

Will O
the O
housing N
market N
in O
Dallas O
begin O
booming O
like O
the O
rest N
of O
the O
nation N
has O
due O
to O
the O
influx N
of O
buyers H
? O

Will O
businesses N
that O
were O
new O
in O
2005 O
have O
become O
a O
household N
name N
due O
to O
their O
efforts N

will O
the O

have O
credibility N
so O
what's O
what O
's H
the O
point N
? O

What O
I H
know O
is O
that O
I H
have O
a O
close O
friend H
who's O
aunt H
disappeared O
in O
New H
Orleans O
. O

My H
friend H
didn't O
did O
n't O
have O
computer N
capability N
, O
so O
I H
spent O
the O
day N
searching O
and O
posting N
online O
. O

The O
family H
here O
( O
California O
) O
wanted O
to O
fly O
any O
family H
members H
from O
there O
to O
CA O
, O
so O
they O
could O
remain O
here O
until O
things N
got O
straightened O
out O
down O
there O
. O

The O
cousins H
could O
not O
be O
found O
because O
no O
one N
was O
sure O
of O
their O
married O
names N
. O

The O
hope O
was O
that O
anyone O
looking O
for O
the O
Aunt H
would O
see O
the O
family H
post N
and O
know O
that O
help O
was O
available O
. O

It O
is O
Oct. O
6 O
, O
and O
not O
one N
family H
member N
has O
been O
located O
. O

What O
I H
saw O
was O
dozens N
of O
school N
buses N
submerged O
that O
could O
have O
been O
used O
to O
evacuate O
people N
who O
had O
no O
transportation N
. O

What O
I H
heard O
was O
the O
Mayor O
of O
New H
Orleans O
, O
saying O
that O
he O
didn't O
did O
n't O
order O
the O
buses N
or O
anything O
else O
to O
be O
used O
because O
he O
was O
waiting O
on O
someone H
else O
to O
tell O
him O
what O
to O
do O
. O

When O
common O
sense N
takes O
a O
back O
seat N
to O
politics N
and O
legal O
mumbo O
jumbo O
what O
have O
we H
become O
? O

Recently O
, O
Bush H
addressed O
the O
nation N
. O

About O
30 O
seconds N
into O
his O
address N
, O
he O
started O
flogging O
the O
terrorist H
issue N
just O
one N
more O
time N
. O

Ironically O
he O
almost O
burst O
out O
laughing O
and O
it O
was O
all O
he O
could O
do O
to O
keep O
his O
mirth N
down O
to O
a O
barely O
controlled O
smirk N
. O

Even O
he O
can't O
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
he O
is O
trotting O
out O
this O
old O
saw O
again O
. O

I H
guess O
if O
you H
have O
a O
schtick N
that O
is O
a O
resounding O
success N
once O
, O
you H
can't O
ca O
n't O
help O
but O
trot N
it O
out O
every O
time N
your H
act N
is O
going O
sour O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
every O
pocket N
that O
can O
be O
lined O
is O
golden O
and O
the O
poor O
are O
shunted O
off O
radar N
yet O
again O
. O

The O
gall N
of O
it O
all O
is O
that O
Bush H
is O
stumping O
for O
more O
money N
to O
build O
more O
refineries N
, O
when O
what O
he O
should O
do O
is O
pour O
money N
into O
making O
the O
US O
independent O
of O
OPEC O
or O
crude O
oil N
all O
together O
. O

We H
have O
the O
technology N
; O
if O
you H
are O
going O
to O
spend O
billions N
of O
dollars N
touting O
" O
FREEDOM N
" O
why O
not O
spend O
those O
billions N
making O
all O
of O
us H
free O
? O

Free O
of O
polution O
, O
free O
of O
oil N
dependency N
, O
and O
free O
of O
big O
business N
that O
is O
bleeding O
us H
dry H
for O
the O
short O
term N
good O
( O
theirs O
) O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
sorry O
he O
makes O
me H
want O
to O
puke O
so O
I H
shut O
him O
off O
. O

In O
the O
meanwhile N
there O
are O
still O
broken O
families N
that O
should O
have O
been O
safe O
in O
the O
home N
of O
the O
brave O
. O

For O
those O
who O

tremendous O

He O
could O
do O
little O
during O
the O
day N
, O
for O
Murillo O
took O
every O
precaution N
and O
never O
went O
out O
save O
with O
his O
satellite N
Lucas H
, O
or O
Lopez H
as O
he O
was O
known O
in O
the O
days N
of O
his O
greatness N
. O

At O
night N
, O
however O
, O
he O
slept O
alone O
, O
and O
the O
avenger H
might O
find O
him O
. O

On O
a O
certain O
evening N
, O
which O
had O
been O
prearranged O
, O
I H
sent O
my H
friend H
final O
instructions N
, O
for O
the O
man H
was O
forever O
on O
the O
alert N
and O
continually O
changed O
his O
room N
. O

I H
was O
to O
see O
that O
the O
doors N
were O
open O
and O
the O
signal N
of O
a O
green O
or O
white O
light N
in O
a O
window N
which O
faced O
the O
drive O
was O
to O
give O
notice O
if O
all O
was O
safe O
or O
if O
the O
attempt N
had O
better O
be O
postponed O
. O

" O
But O
everything O
went O
wrong O
with O
us H
. O

In O
some O
way N
I H
had O
excited O
the O
suspicion N
of O
Lopez H
, O
the O
secretary H
. O

He O
crept O
up O
behind O
me H
and O
sprang O
upon O
me H
just O
as O
I H
had O
finished O
the O
note N
. O

He O
and O
his O
master O
dragged O
me H
to O
my H
room N
and O
held O
judgment N
upon O
me H
as O
a O
convicted O
traitress H
. O

Then O
and O
there O
they O
would O
have O
plunged O
their O
knives N
into O
me H
could O
they O
have O
seen O
how O
to O
escape O
the O
consequences N
of O
the O
deed O
. O

Finally O
, O
after O
much O
debate N
, O
they O
concluded O
that O
my H
murder O
was O
too O
dangerous O
. O

But O
they O
determined O
to O
get O
rid O
forever O
of O
Garcia H
. O

They O
had O
gagged O
me H
, O
and O
Murillo O
twisted O
my H
arm N
round O
until O
I H
gave O
him O
the O
address N
. O

I H
swear O
that O
he O
might O
have O
twisted O
it O
off O
had O
I H
understood O
what O
it O
would O
mean O
to O
Garcia H
. O

Lopez H
addressed O
the O
note N
which O
I H
had O
written O
, O
sealed O
it O
with O
his O
sleeve N
- O
link N
, O
and O
sent O
it O
by O
the O
hand N
of O
the O
servant H
, O
Jose H
. O

How O
they O
murdered O
him O
I H
do O
not O
know O
, O
save O
that O
it O
was O
Murillo's O
Murillo O
's H
hand N
who O
struck O
him O
down O
, O
for O
Lopez H
had O
remained O
to O
guard O
me H
. O

I H
believe O
he O
must O
have O
waited O
among O
the O
gorse A
bushes A
through O
which O
the O
path N
winds N
and O
struck O
him O
down O
as O
he O
passed O
. O

At O
first O
they O
were O
of O
a O
mind N
to O
let O
him O
enter O
the O
house N
and O
to O
kill O
him O
as O
a O
detected O
burglar H
; O
but O
they O
argued O
that O
if O
they O
were O
mixed O
up O
in O
an O
inquiry N
their O
own O
identity N
would O
at O
once O
be O
publicly O
disclosed O
and O
they O
would O
be O
open O
to O
further O
attacks N
. O

With O
the O
death N
of O
Garcia H
, O
the O
pursuit N
might O
cease O
, O
since O
such O
a O
death N
might O
frighten O
others O
from O
the O
task N
. O

Antichrist O
John H

wanted O

so O

The O
CURSE N

upon O

on O

all O

The O
CURSE N
OF O
GOD O
carried O
on O
until O
he O
was O
shot N
dead O

It O
is O
interesting O
to O
notice O
that O
he O
was O
shot N
seven O
times N

seven O
, O
as O
well O
as O
three O

the O

After O
George H

said O
arrogantly O
in O

Henley O
on O
Thames O
: O
" O
I H
want O

of O
those O
words N

made O

carried O
on O

final O
death N

To O
Paul H
McCartney H
whose O
company's N
company N

logo N
was O
a O
person H
toying O
with O
the O
planets N
as O
if O
he O
was O
a O
god A
, O
and O
who O
was O
being O
very O
much O
deluded O
in O
his O
ego N
trip N
by O
the O
fact N
that O
he O
was O
made O
" O
Sir O

( O
when O
in O
England O
even O
the O
road N

made O
Sir O

he O
produces O
money N

the O

, O
GOD O
provided O
cancer N

the O

The O
advertising N
farce N
of O
how O
much O
he O
loved O
Linda H
( O
woman H
whose O
quality N
he O
did O
not O
deserve O
) O
, O
was O
exposed O
when O
it O
was O
known O
that O
Paul H
had O
an O
affair N
with O
Heather H
Mills H
, O
Linda's O
Linda H

intimate O
friend H

with O
whom O
McCartney H
went O
on O
a O
trip N

New H
York H

to O
whom O
he O
bought O
things N

presents O
, O
while O
he O
was O
still O
mourning N
for O
his O
" O
dear O
Linda H
" O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time N
McCartney H
was O
going O
out O
with O
Heather H
Mills H
, O
he O
used O
Linda's O
Linda H
's H
death N
for O
promotional O
ends O
, O
due O
to O
his O
waning O
popularity N
. O

Paul H
was O
going O
out O
with O
Heather H
, O
but O
in O
front N
of O
the O
audience N
he O
played O
the O
faithful O
husband's O
husband H
's H
masquerade N
pretending O
to O
suffer O
for O
Linda H
, O
for O
the O
afore O
mentioned O
promotional O
ends O
. O

Paul H
admitted O
that O
he O
made O
Linda H
suffer O
a O
lot N
, O
but O
he O
didn't O
did O
n't O
say O
that O
it O
was O
because O
he O
felt N
insecure O
as O
a O
man H
due O
to O
his O
womanish O
face N
and O
effeminate O
manners N
and O
also O
because O
with O
his O
age N
his O
sexual O
power N
was O
not O
the O
same O
, O
even O
though O
it O
has O
never O
been O
much O
. O

The O
early O
days N
were O
the O
days N
of O
competition N
between O
Paul H
and O
his O
wife H
and O
John H
and O
his O
wife H
and O
he O
knew O
he O
had O
to O
compete O
with O
ugly O
John H
for O
the O
leadership N
of O
the O
band N
in O
front N
of O
their O
wives H
and O
having O
Yoko O
Ono O
made O
him O
aware O
of O
his O
lack N
of O
virility N
and O
repressed O
homosexuality N
, O
he O
grew O
the O
beard N
that O
we H
see O
in O
the O
" O
Let O
it O
Be O
" O
film N
and O
started O
to O
show O
pictures N
of O
naked O
women H
in O
the O
same O
film N
, O
doing O
every O
effort N
he O
could O
to O
be O
seen O
as O
a O
man H
.... O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
note N
the O
uneasiness N
of O
McCartney H
when O
he O
sings O
: O
" O
I've O
I H
've O
got O
a O
feeling O
, O
a O
feeling O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
hide N
... O
" O
in O
front N
of O
Yoko O
in O
the O
film N
. O

( O
He O
already O
had O
the O
traumas N
that O
his O
previous O
girlfriend H
Jane H
Asher H
had O
caused O
him O
when O
she O
made O
him O
aware O
of O
his O
little O
manliness N
and O
effeminate O
manners N
) O
. O

Paul H
has O
such O
a O
big O
inferiority N
complex O
as O
a O
man H
, O
due O
to O
his O
effeminate O
face N
, O
body N
and O
personality N
and O
due O
to O
his O
repressed O
homosexuality N
, O
that O
he O
found O
himself O
a O
handicapped O
woman H
with O
only O
one N
leg N
, O
so O
that O
he O
could O
stand O
out O
, O
being O
very O
conscious O
that O
a O
full O
woman H
would O
make O
him O
feel O
the O
superiority N
of O
virile O
men H
again O
, O
as O
Jane H
and O
Linda H
did O
. O

This O
is O
something O
that O
his O
ego N
trip N
of O
lucky O
bad O
musician H
could O
not O
face N
anymore O

Besides O
being O
a O
murderer H

John H

had O
sexual O
intercourse N

Brian H

to O
get O
him O
interested O

going O

the O

trauma N

he O
never O

Because O
of O
the O
trauma N
that O
his O
homosexual O
relation N
with O
Brian H
Epstein O
had O
left O
him O
, O
he O
made O
lyrics N
such O
as O
: O
" O
You H
can O
wear O
a O
collar N

a O

one N
thing N
you H
can't O
ca O

hide N

when O
you're O
you H

crippled O
inside O
" O

gave O
declarations N

the O
" O

that O
" O
sometimes O
he O
wore O

The O
Beatles O
are O
very O
well O
known O
by O
people N
close O
to O
them O
for O
their O
arrogance N
and O
racism N
. O

One O
of O
the O
manifestations N
of O
their O
racism N
is O
the O
rejection N
towards O
Japanese O
Yoko O
Ono O
. O

That O
rejection N
got O
to O
the O
point N
that O
George H
Harrison H
kicked O
Yoko O
Ono O
in O
the O
Apple O
studios N
during O
the O
filming N
of O
Let O

Be O
. O

When O
John H
asked O
George H
while O
they O
were O
having O
lunch N
about O
how O
things N
were O
going O
for O
Paul H
after O
his O
separation N
from O
the O
Beatles O
and O
George H
replied O
that O
he O
was O
number N
one N
in O
the O
Swedish O
hit O
parade N
, O
John H
said O
in O
a O
despective O
manner N
: O
" O
ah O
!! O
.. O
in O
Sweden O
.. O
" O
, O
as O
if O
Sweden O
was O
an O
inferior O
place N
or O
something O
alike O
. O

In O
the O
Beatles' O
Beatles O
' O
song N
" O
Get O
Back N
" O
they O
advise O
black O
Joe H
to O
" O
get O
back O
to O
where O
you H
once O
belonged O
" O
, O
as O
if O
England O
was O
not O
a O
place N
for O
black O
people N
. O

Sometimes O
back O
, O
Paul H
told O
George H
in O
the O
Apple O
offices N
that O
the O
new O
generations A
are O
a O
bundle N
of O
idiots H
and O
useless O
people N
, O
but O
in O
any O
way N
they O
would O
have O
also O
been O
slaves H
of O
the O
Beatles O
. O

The O
Jewish O
marriage N
living O
to O
the O
right O
of O
George's O
George H
's H
house N
said O
that O
he O
is O
an O
arrogant O
person H
who O
does O
never O
return O
a O
greeting N
. O

The O
newly O
married O

living O
on O

corner N
in O

of O
the O
entrance N
of O
George's O
George H

house N
( O
Friar O

refers O
to O
him O
as O
an O
overbearing O
person H
to O
stay O
away O
from O

The O
receptionist H
of O
" O
Hand O
made O
" O
, O
the O
former O
film N
making O
company N
of O
George H
Harrison H
said O
: O
" O
we H
don't O
do O

any O

man H
anymore O
and O
we H
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
know O
anything O
about O
him O
" O
. O

It O
is O
interesting O
to O
note N
that O
this O
company N
was O
made O
bankrupt O
by O
the O
British O
cinema N
industry N
due O
to O
the O
despotism N
and O
pedantry N
of O
George H
Harrison H
, O
who O
believed O
that O
the O
cinema N
industry N
would O
have O
worshiped O
him O
. O

Their O
chauvinisms N
got O
to O
the O
point N
that O
even O
they O
themselves O
hated O
each O
other O
. O

Paul H
McCartney H
said O
that O
George H
Harrison H
is O
a O
nothing N
. O

George H
Harrison H
said O
that O
he O
is O
tired O
of O
listening O
to O
people N
talk O
about O
John H
Lennon H
.... O

George H
Harrison H
said O
in O
a O
video N
that O
" O
Oasis O
is O
a O
very O
untalented O
band N
and O
they O
shouldn't O
should O
n't O
be O
playing O
at O
all O
" O
, O
all O
of O
it O
being O
the O
truth N
, O
but O
the O
Beatles O
is O
also O
a O
band N
of O
very O
poor O
musicians H
, O
if O
musicians H
at O
all O
, O
who O
could O
only O
play O
a O
couple N
of O
elementary O
guitar N
chords N
and O
who O
are O
as O
untalented O
as O
Oasis O
. O

The O
Beatles O
of O
the O
times N
of O
the O
" O
Cavern O
" O
sounded O
exactly O
as O
poorly O
as O
Oasis O
and O
the O
little O
musical N
quality N
in O
the O
songs N
of O
the O
Beatles O
is O
due O
to O
George H
Martin H
. O

Without O
George H
Martin H
the O
Beatles O
would O
have O
been O
just O
another O
untalented O
band N
as O
Oasis O
.... O

Paul H
McCartney H
said O
recently O
that O
he O
believes O
in O
using O
magic N
, O
and O
he O
does O
lots N
of O
charity N
, O
thinking O
that O
in O
this O
way N
he O
will O
compensate O
for O
the O
CURSE N
OF O
GOD O
that O
is O
upon O
him O
and O
that O
took O
his O
wife's O
wife H
's H
life N
because O
of O
his O
Satanism O
and O
involvement N
in O
black O
magic N
. O

He O
thinks O
he O
will O
deceive O
people N
in O
this O
way N
, O
so O
that O
the O
real O
McCartney H
will O
not O
be O
perceived O
. O

Is O
the O
old O
Devil H
attempting O
to O
disguise O
as O
good O
in O
front N
of O
people N
. O

Satan H
deceiving O
mankind N
once O
again O
, O
as O
so O
many O
other O
thousands N

through O

The O
fact N
that O

as O
the O

achieved O
such O
a O
giant A
fame N
that O
not O
even O
the O
real O
quality N

could O
achieve O
, O
was O
because O
the O
forces N
of O

were O
behind O
everything O
, O
supporting O

. O
Blowback N
in O
Iraq O

The O
recent O
elections N
in O
Iraq O
were O
dominated O
by O
an O
amalgam N
of O
religiously O
fundamentalist O
Shi'ite O
organizations N
, O
principally O
the O
Dawa O
Party O
and O
the O
Supreme O
Council N
for O
Islamic O
Revolution N
in O
Iraq O
( O
SCIRI O
) O
. O

Both O
Dawa O
and O
SCIRI O
have O
umbilical O
connections N
to O
the O
fundamentalist O
Shi'ite O
leadership N
in O
Iran O
that O
go O
back O
decades N
. O

In O
essence N
, O
Iran O
now O
owns O
a O
significant O
portion N
of O
the O
Iraqi O
government N
. O

Should O
the O
United O
States O
undertake O
military O
action N
against O
Iran O
, O
the O
ramifications N
in O
Iraq O
would O
be O
immediate O
and O
extreme O
. O

In O
the O
first O
eight O
days N
of O
January O
, O
eighteen O
US O
troops N
have O
been O
killed O
in O
Iraq O
, O
compounded O
by O
another O
twelve O
deaths N
from O
a O
Black H
Hawk O
helicopter N
crash O
on O
Saturday O
. O

Much O
of O
the O
violence N
aimed O
at O
American O
forces N
is O
coming O
from O
disgruntled O
Sunni O
factions N
that O
have O
their O
own O
militias N
, O
believe O
the O
last O
elections N
were O
a O
sham O
, O
and O
hold O
little O
political O
power N
in O
the O
government N
. O

If O
the O
US O
attacks N
Iran O
, O
it O
is O
probable O
that O
American O
forces N
- O
already O
taxed O
by O
attacks N
from O
Sunni O
factions N
- O
will O
also O
face N
reprisal N
attacks N
in O
Iraq O
from O
Shi'ite O
factions N
loyal O
to O
Iran O
. O

The O
result N
will O
be O
a O
dramatic O
escalation N
in O
US O
and O
civilian O
casualties H
, O
US O
forces N
will O
be O
required O
to O
bunker O
themselves O
further O
into O
their O
bases O
, O
and O
US O
forces N
will O
find O
themselves O
required O
to O
fight N
the O
very O
government N
they O
just O
finished O
helping O
into O
power N
. O

Iraq O
, O
already O
a O
seething O
cauldron N
, O
will O
sink N
further O
into O
chaos O
. O

Unlike O
Iraq O
, O
Iran O
has O
not O
spent O
the O
last O
fifteen O
years N
having O
its O
conventional O

worn O
down O

Missile N
batteries N
arrayed O
in O
those O
mountains N
could O
raise O
bloody O
havoc N
with O
any O
fleet N
deployed O
below O
. O

Of O
all O
the O
missiles N
in O
Iran's O
Iran O
's H
armament N
, O
the O
most O
dangerous O
is O
the O
Russian O
- O
made O
SS-N-22 O
Sunburn O
. O

These O
missiles N
are O
, O
simply O
, O
the O
fastest O
anti-ship O
weapons N
on O
the O
planet N
. O

The O
Sunburn O
can O
reach O
Mach H
3 O
at O
high O
altitude N
. O

Its O
maximum O
low O
- O
altitude N
speed N
is O
Mach H
2.2 O
, O
some O
three O
times N
faster O
than O
the O
American O
- O
made O
Harpoon O
. O

The O
Sunburn O
takes O
two O
short O
minutes N
to O
cover O
its O
full O
range N
. O

The O
missile's O
missile N
's H
manufacturers N
state N
that O
one N
or O
two O
missiles N
could O
cripple O
a O
destroyer N
, O
and O
five O
missiles N
could O
sink N
a O
20,000 O
ton N
ship N
. O

The O
Sunburn O
is O
also O
superior O
to O
the O
Exocet O
missile N
. O

Recall O
that O
it O
was O
two O
Exocets O
that O
ripped O
the O
USS O
Stark H
to O
shreds N
in O
1987 O
, O
killing O
37 O
sailors H
. O

The O
Stark H
could O
not O
see O
them O
to O
stop N
them O
. O

The O
US O
aircraft N
carrier N
Theodore H
Roosevelt H
is O
currently O
deployed O
in O
the O
Persian O
Gulf O
, O
with O
some O
7,000 O
souls H
aboard O
. O

Sailing O
with O
the O
Roosevelt H
is O
the O
Tarawa O

which O
includes O
the O
USS O
Tarawa O
, O
the O
USS O

, O
and O
the O
USS O
Pearl O

. O

The O
USS O
Austin H
is O
likewise O
deployed O
in O
the O
Gulf O
. O

The O
Sunburn O
missile N
, O
with O
its O
incredible O
speed N
and O
ability N
to O
avoid O
radar N
detection N
, O
would O
do O
terrible O
damage N
these O
ships N
if O
Iran O
chooses O
to O
retaliate O
in O
the O
Gulf O
after O
an O
American O
attack N
within O
its O
borders N
. O

Beyond O
the O
naval O
threat N
is O
the O
possibility N
of O
Iran O
throwing O
its O
military O
muscle N
into O
the O
ongoing O
struggle O
in O
Iraq O
. O

Currently O
, O
the O
US O
is O
facing O
an O
asymmetrical O
attack N
from O
groups N
wielding O
small O
arms N
, O
shoulder N
- O
fired O
grenades N
and O
roadside N
bombs N
. O

The O
vaunted O
American O
military O
has O
suffered O
2,210 O
deaths N
and O
tens N
of O
thousands N
of O
wounded O
from O
this O
form N
of O
warfare N
. O

The O
occupation N
of O
Iraq O
has O
become O
a O
guerrilla H
war N
, O
a O
siege N
that O
has O
lasted O
more O
than O
a O
thousand O
days N
. O

If O
Iran O
decides O
to O
throw O
any O
or O
all O
of O
its O
23,000 O
armored O
fighting O
vehicles N
, O
along O
with O
any O
or O
all O
of O
its O
nearly O

- O
strong O
army N
, O
into O
the O
Iraq O
fray N

the O
situation N

could O
become O
unspeakably O
dire O

The O
Syrian O
Connection N

In O
February O
of O
2005 O
, O
Iran O
and O
Syria O
agreed O
upon O
a O
mutual O
protection N
pact N
to O
combat O
" O
challenges N
and O
threats N
" O
in O
the O
region N
. O

This O
was O
a O
specific O
reaction N
to O
the O
American O
invasion N
of O
Iraq O
, O
and O
a O
reaction N
to O
America's O
America O
's H
condemnation N
of O
Syria O
after O
the O
death N
of O
Lebanese O
Prime O
Minister H
Rafik O
Hariri O
, O
which O
was O
widely O
seen O
as O
an O
assassination N
ordered O
from O
Damascus O
. O

An O
attack N
on O
Iran O
would O
trigger N
this O
mutual O
defense N
pact N
, O
and O
could O
conceivably O
bring O
Syria O
into O
direct O
conflict N
with O
American O
forces N
. O

Like O
Iran O
, O
Syria's O
Syria O
's H
military O
is O
nothing N
to O
scoff O
at O
. O

Virtually O
every O
credible O
analysis N
has O
Syria O
standing N
as O
the O
strongest O
military O
force N
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
after O
Israel O
. O

Damascus O
has O
been O
intent N
for O
years N
upon O
establishing O
significant O
military O
strength N
to O
serve O
as O
a O
counterweight N
to O
Israel's O
Israel O
's H
overwhelming O
capabilities N
. O

As O
of O
2002 O
, O
Syria O
had O
some O
215,000 O
soldiers H
under O
arms N
, O
4,700 O
tanks N
, O
and O
a O
massive O
artillery N
capability N
. O

The O
Syrian O
Air O
Force O
is O
comprised O
of O
ten O
to O
eleven O
fighter N
/ O
attack N
squadrons N
and O
sixteen O
fighter N
squadrons N
, O
totaling O
somewhere O
near O
650 O
aircraft N
. O

Syria O
also O
possesses O
one N
of O
the O
largest O
arsenals N
of O
ballistic O
missiles N
in O
the O
region N
, O
comprised O
primarily O
of O
SCUD O
- O
derived O
systems N
. O

Iran O
, O
North H
Korea O
and O
China O
have O
been O
willing O
providers H
of O
state N
- O
of O
- O
the O
- O
art N
technologies N
. O

Compounding O
this O
is O
the O
well O
- O
based O
suspicion N
that O
Syria O
has O
perhaps O
the O
most O
advanced O
chemical N
weapons N
capability N
in O
the O
Persian O
Gulf O
. O

and O

large O
if O
the O

Iran O
, O
all O
pale O
in O
comparison N
to O
the O
involvement N
of O
China O
in O
any O
US O
/ O
Iran O
engagement N
. O

China's O
China O
's H
economy N
is O
exploding O
, O
hampered O
only O
by O
their O
great O
thirst N
for O
petroleum N
and O
natural O
gas N
to O
fuel N
their O
industry N
. O

In O
the O
last O
several O
months N
, O
China O
has O
inked O
deals N
with O
Iran O
for O
$ O
70 O
billion O
dollars N
worth N
of O
Iranian O
oil N
and O
natural O
gas N
. O

China O
will O
purchase N
250 O
million O
tons N
of O
liquefied O
natural O
gas N
from O
Iran O
over O
the O
next O
30 O
years N
, O
will O
develop O
the O
massive O
Yadavaran O
oil N
field N
in O
Iran O
, O
and O
will O
receive O
150,000 O
barrels N
of O
oil N
per O
day N
from O
that O
field N
. O

China O
is O
seeking O
the O
construction N
of O
a O
pipeline N
from O
Iran O
to O
the O
Caspian O
Sea N
, O
where O
it O
would O
link N
with O
another O
planned O
pipeline N
running O
from O
Kazakhstan O
to O
China O
. O

Any O
US O
attack N
on O
Iran O
could O
be O
perceived O
by O
China O
as O
a O
direct O
threat N
to O
its O
economic O
health N
. O

Further O
, O
any O
fighting O
in O
the O
Persian O
Gulf O
would O
imperil O
the O
tankers N
running O
China's O
China O
's H
liquefied O
natural O
gas N
through O
the O
Strait O
of O
Hormuz O
. O

Should O
China O
decide O
to O
retaliate O
against O
the O
US O
to O
defend O
its O
oil N
and O
natural O
gas N
deal O
with O
Iran O
, O
the O
US O
would O
be O
faced O
with O
a O
significant O
threat N
. O

This O
threat N
exists O
not O
merely O
on O
a O
military O
level N
, O
though O
China O
could O
force N
a O
confrontation N
in O
the O
Pacific O
by O
way N
of O
Taiwan O
. O

More O

China O
holds O
a O
large O
portion N

the O
American O

in O
the O
palm A
of O

Paul H
Craig H
Roberts H
, O
writing N
for O
The O
American O
Conservative O
, O
said O
in O
July O
of O
2005 O
that O
" O
As O
a O

Japanese O
government N

China's O
China O

is O
approximately O
$ O
600 O
billion O
. O

South O
Korea O
holds O
about O
$ O
200 O
billion O
. O

These O
sums N
give O
these O
countries N
enormous O
leverage N
over O
the O
United O
States O
. O

By O
dumping N
some O
portion N
of O
their O
reserves N
, O
these O
countries N
could O
put O
the O
dollar N
under O
intense O
pressure O
and O
send O
U.S. O
interest N

. O

Washington O
would O
really O
have O
to O
anger N
Japan O

Korea O
to O
provoke O
such O
action N
, O
but O
in O
a O
showdown N
with O
China O

over O

for O

and O
the O

The O
rapid O
victory N

cemented O
this O
perception N

The O
last O

Conclusion N
: O
Is O
Any O
of O
This O
Possible O
? O

The O
question N
must O
be O
put O
as O
directly O
as O
possible O
: O
what O
manner N
of O
maniac H
would O
undertake O
a O
path N
so O
fraught O
with O
peril N
and O
potential N
economic O
catastrophe N
? O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
imagine O
a O
justification N
for O
any O
action N
that O
could O
envelop O
the O
United O
States O
in O
a O
military O
and O
economic O
conflict N
with O
Iraq O
, O
Iran O
, O
Syria O
and O
China O
simultaneously O
. O

Iran O
is O
suspected O
by O
many O
nations N
of O
working O
towards O
the O
development N
of O
nuclear O
weapons N
, O
but O
even O
this O
justification N
has O
been O
tossed O
into O
a O
cocked O
hat N
. O

Recently O
, O
Russian O
president H
Vladimir H
Putin H
bluntly O
stated O
that O
Iran O
is O
not O
developing O
its O
nuclear O
capability N
for O
any O
reasons N
beyond O
peaceful O
energy N
creation N
, O
and O
pledged O
to O
continue O
assisting O
Iran O
in O
this O
endeavor N
. O

Therefore O
, O
any O
attack N
upon O
Iran's O
Iran O
's H
nuclear O
facilities N
will O
bring O
Russia O
into O
the O
mess N
. O

Iran O
also O
stands O
accused O
of O
aiding O
terrorism N
across O
the O
globe N
. O

The O
dangers N
implicit O
in O
any O
attack N
upon O
that O
nation N
, O
however O
, O
seem O
to O
significantly O
offset O
whatever O
gains N
could O
be O
made O
in O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O
War N
on O
Terror O
. O
" O

Unfortunately O
, O
all O
the O
dangers N
in O
the O
world N
are O
no O
match O
for O
the O
self O
- O
assurance N
of O
a O
bubble N
- O
encased O
zealot H
. O

What O
manner N
of O
maniac H
would O
undertake O
such O
a O
dangerous O
course N
? O

Look O
no O
further O
than O
1600 O
Pennsylvania O
Avenue O
. O

George H
W. O
Bush H
and O
his O
administration N
have O
consistently O
undertaken O
incredibly O
dangerous O
courses N
of O
action N
in O
order O
to O
garner O
political O
power N
on O
the O
home N
front N
. O

Recall O
the O
multiple O
terror N
threats N
lobbed O
out O
by O
the O
administration N
whenever O
damaging O
political O
news N
appeared O
in O
the O
media N
. O

More O
significantly O
, O
recall O
Iraq O
. O

Karl H
Rove O
, O
Bush's O
Bush H
's H
most O
senior H
advisor H
, O
notoriously O
told O
Republicans O
on O
the O
ballot N
during O
the O
2002 O
midterms N
to O
" O
run O
on O
the O
war N
. O
" O

The O
invasion N
of O
Iraq O
provided O
marvelous O
political O
cover O
for O
the O
GOP O
not O
only O
during O
those O
midterms N
, O
but O
during O
the O
2004 O
Presidential O
election N
. O

What O
kind N
of O
political O
cover O
would O
be O
gained O
from O
an O
attack N
on O
Iran O
, O
and O
from O
the O
diversion N
of O
attention N
to O
that O
attack N
? O

The O
answer N
lies N
in O
one N
now O
- O

and O
repeat O

How O
could O
I H
work N
with O
her O
to O
get O
off O
her O
four O
hand N
, O
get O
balance O
, O
and O
lope O
smoothly O
and O
slowly O
?? O

Put O
on O
a O
pair N
of O
spurs N
and O
before O
she O
makes O
that O
trot N
step O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
in O
the O
feeling O
when O
you H
feel O
her O
think O
trot N
, O
tick O
her O
with O
the O
spur N
and O
lift O
with O
your H
body N
to O
keep O
her O
moving O
. O

If O
you H
concentrate O
on O
that O
feel O
just O
before O
the O
trot N
you H
can O
figure O
it O
out O
and O
the O
timing N
is O
essential O
to O
push O
her O
at O
that O
instant O
. O

Lope O
her O
to O
the O
left O
in O
circles O
, O
keep O
her O
head N
to O
the O
inside O
of O
the O
circle N
and O
push O
her O
but O
out O
, O
keep O
doing O
this O
if O
she O
breaks O
to O
a O
jog N
go O
a O
little O
bit N
bigger O
circle N
, O
till O
she O
can O
get O
enough O
balance O
to O
go O
small O
and O

i H
have O
an O
nikon O

.. O
im O
i H
m O
wondering O
why O
if O
i H

almost O

.. O
i H
can O

some O
dead O

... O
is O
there O
something O
wrong O
with O
my H

? O

or O
what O
? O

please O
help O
me H
.. O
and O
what O
should O
i H
do O
to O
fix O
this O
problem N
? O

or O
it O
is O
normal O
? O

Are O
you H
sure O
it O
isn't O
is O
n't O
dirt N
on O
the O
sensor N
? O

Put O
the O
camera N
on O
manual N
focus O
and O
set O
focus O
to O
infinity N

Take O
a O
photo N
of O
a O
very O
light N
plain O
subject O
close O
to O
the O
lens N
using O
long O
exposure N
and O
smallest O
aperture N
you H
have O
- O
over O
expose O
by O
a O
couple N
of O
stops N

You H
will O
see O
in O
the O
image N
if O
there O
is O
dirt N
as O
that O
will O
be O
the O
only O
thing N
in O
focus O

Cure N
is O
to O
get O
the O
sensor N
cleaned O

There O
should O
be O
a O
Pixel N
Mapping N
function N
in O
the O
menu N
that O
will O
get O
rid O
of O
them O
, O
most O

have O
a O
few O
dead O

pixels N
, O
some O
only O
show O
up O
on O
long O

visa N

If O
you H
apply O
for O
a O
skilled O
migrant O
workers H
worker O
s H
visa N
and O
it O
is O
accepted O
do O
you H
have O
to O
find O
work N
in O
the O
same O
sector N
as O
your H
skills N
on O
your H
application N
or O
can O
you H
take O
up O
other O
work N
if O
you H
can't O
ca O
n't O
find O
something O
in O
your H
own O
field N
. O

I H
have O
posted O
this O
question N
on O
the O
NZ O
visa N
site N
and O
can't O
ca O
n't O
get O
any O
info N
, O
does O
anyone O
know O
.??? O

Watch O
out O
the O
poles N
are O
coming O
..... O
my H
little O
butterfly A

That O
would O
be O
preferable O
but O
it O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
matter N
, O
could O
be O
something O
similar O

It O
depends O
on O
the O
conditions N
of O
your H
skilled O
migrant O
visa N
. O

Your H
visa N
should O
say O
whether O
or O
not O
you H
are O
restricted O
to O
work N
in O
a O
specific O
sector N
. O

If O
your H
visa N
does O
not O
restrict O
you H
from O
taking O
any O
work N
in O
New H
Zealand O
then O
you H
can O
work N
in O
any O
sector N
. O

It O
only O
matters N
if O
you H
received O
an O
offer O
of O
employment N
or O
if O
you H
are O
currently O
working O
in O
New H
Zealand O
and O
used O
that O
job N
in O
your H
application N
to O
get O
your H

In O
Chicago O
, O
what O
is O
the O
best O
restaurant N
to O
dine O
at O
on O
a O
budget N
? O

Downtown O
Chicago O
, O
Loop O
, O
North H

Take O
the O
red O
line N
to O
Clark H
, O
then O
you H
turn O
right O
. O

Walk O
2 O
blocks N
then O
turn O
right O
again O
. O

Walk O
2 O
more O
blocks N
then O
cross O
the O
street N
. O

You H
will O
get O
to O
a O
place N
called O
" O
BIG O
BOWL O
" O
. O

THAI O
FOOD N
AND O
ASIAN O
. O

BEST O
PLACE N
EVER O
!!!!!!!!!!!! O

McDonalds O
McDonald O
s H

Not O
necessarily O
the O
restaurant N
but O
what O
you H
order O
when O
you H
get O
there O
and O
what O
time N
you H
go O
. O

A H
lunch N
will O
be O
less O
expensive O
than O
a O
dinner N
. O

You H
can O
order O
appetizers N
rather O
than O
a O
full O
meal N
and O
have O
just O
as O
good O
a O
dinner N
. O

But O
the O
best O
way N
is O
to O
use H
coupons N
. O

Check O
out O
http://www.restaurant.com O
lots N
of O
restaurants N
you H
can O
look O
at O
the O
menu N
and O
check O
out O
prices N
. O

Yo H
also O
may O
want O
to O
try O
" O
small O
neighborhood N
" O
restaurants N
and O
support N
family H
run O
places N
rather O
than O
the O
large O
corporate O
chains N
. O

Not O
that O
there O
is O
anything O
wrong O
with O
that O
because O
they O
also O
employ O
local O
people N
that O
live O
and O
shop N
in O
the O
area N
. O

Is O
there O
any O
cure N
for O
mouse A
poison N
? O

I H
found O
a O
poor O
little O
mouse A
walking O
around O
in O
my H
friends H
friend H
s H
house N
, O
and O
since O
I H
was O
able O
to O
catch O
it O
very O
easily O
( O
normally O
mice A
move O
at O
the O
speed N
of O
light N
) O
, O
and O
since O
it O
was O
acting N
unresponsive O
, O
I H
thought O
it O
was O
infected O
with O
mouse A
poison N
, O
since O
my H
friend H
uses O
it O
. O

I H
know O
that O
the O
mouse A
will O
probably O
die O
, O
but O
I H
was O
wondering O
if O
there O
is O
any O
cure N
for O
mouse A
poison N
? O

I H
just O
hate O
to O
see O
the O
poor O
dears H
experience N
a O
slow O
painful O
death N
that O
way N
:( O
. O

Without O
knowing O
the O
exact O
poison N
, O
no O
. O

A H
common O
one N
is O
arsenic N
and O
there O
really O
isn't O
is O
n't O
a O
way N
to O
cure N
that O
. O

Take O
the O
mouse A
to O
an O
emergency N
vet H
and O
have O
them O
use H
CO2 N
to O
put O
the O
mouse A
to O
sleep O
. O

Or O
, O
you H
can O
put O
the O
animal A
in O
a O
snap N
trap N
designed O
for O
rats A
or O
mice A
since O
that O
is O
the O
only O
really O
humane O
kill O
method N
for O
invasive O
animals A
. O

A H
quick O
cure N
would O
be O
Arm O
& O
Hammer O
to O
it's O
head N

Crayola O
Air O
- O
Dry H
Clay O
? O

Ok O
. O

So O
I H
have O
a O
VERY O
long O
list N
of O
people N
I H
want O
to O
make O
Xmas O
gifts N
for O
and O
one N
of O
them O
is O
my H
best O
friend H
. O

She O
loves O
giraffes A
and O
homemade O
things N
! O

I H
am O
very O
artistic O
so O
I H
decided O
I H
was O
going O
to O
make O
her O
a O
giraffe A
sculpture N
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
much O
money N
so O
I H
bought O
Crayola O
Air O
- O
Dry H
Clay O
. O

I H
have O
sculpted O
the O
giraffe A
laying N
down O
. O

The O
key N
is O
... O
I H
have O
a O
few O
problems N
: O

1 O
. O
I H
tested O
it O
out O
by O
making O
a O
figure O
boat N

And O
after O
4 O
days N
when O
it O
dried O
it O
was O
very O
fragile O
! O

( O
like O
VERY O
not O
in O
a O
good O
way N
) O

Is O
there O
any O
way N
to O
strengthen O
it O
? O

2 O
. O
What O
kind N
of O
paint O
do O
I H
use H
to O
paint O
the O
giraffe A
? O

3 O
. O
Is O
there O
any O
cheap O
way N
to O
give O
it O
a O
shine N
like O
I H
made O
it O
in O
a O
kiln N
? O

air N
dry H
clay O
works O
on O
armatures N
, O
the O
clay O
has O
a O
minor O
shrink H
percent N
, O
so O
you H
can O
leave O
the O
wire N
armature N
inside O
, O
paint O
with O
acrylic O
paint O

taking O
young O
cat A
with O

for O
a O

a O
3 O
- O
4 O
month N
old O

in O
a O
cabin N
in O

. O

My H

is O
a O
outside O
cat A
but O
she O
loves O
it O
inside O
. O

she O
is O
also O
good O
in O
a O
carrier N
. O

Should O
i H
bring O
her O
? O

if O
so O
how O
quick O
will O
she O
adapt O
to O
a O
litter N
box N
inside O
? O

thanks N

We H
took O
our H
cat A
Mitten O
camping N
. O

He O
loved O
it O
. O

But O
he O
was O
an O
inside O
/ O
outside O
cat A
( O
only O
one N
I H
owned O
- O
rest N
have O
been O
100 O
0nside O
cats A
) O
. O

He O
was O
trained O
to O
a O
harness N
/ O
leash N
for O
outside O
time N
but O
he O
knew O
to O
use H
the O
litter N
pan N
inside O
. O

If O
your H
cat A
is O
not O
trained O
to O
use H
the O
litter N
pan N
, O
you H
may O
have O
a O
problem N
taking O
her O
. O

NO O
! O

changing O
its O
surroundings N
too O
often O
will O
stress N
it O
out O
and O
it O
will O
get O
depressed O
, O
mean O
, O
sick O
, O
or O
will O
not O
want O
to O
be O
around O
you H
. O

What O
cleaners N
should O
I H
use H
for O
dusting O
around O
my H
parakeet A
? O

What O
cleaners N
can O
I H
use H
to O
dust N
around O
my H
budgie A
. O

Would O
pledge N
be O
ok O
? O

If O
not O
, O
what O
is O
? O

Your H
best O
bet N
would O
just O
be O
a O
swiffer O
duster N
-- O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
require O
cleaner N
. O

If O
you H
must O
use H
a O
cleaner N
, O
pledge N
should O
be O
fine O
if O
the O
area N
that O
you H
keep O
your H
parakeet A
in O
is O
well O
ventilated O
. O

I H
have O
had O
parakeets A
for O
a O
VERY O
long O
time N
, O
and O
I H
use H
pledge N
. O

Just O
keep O
a O
window N
open O
for O
a O
while O
for O
fresh O
air N
to O
circulate O
. O

I H
agree O
w O
the O
answer N
from O
Nothing N
. O

Even O
a O
cotton N
cloth N
( O
I H
like O
diapers N
) O
that O
is O
barely O
damp O
w O
water N
will O
work N
fine O
. O

Swiffer O
or O
any O
type N
of O
micro-fiber O
cloth N
is O
excellent O
. O

I H
use H
Miracle O
Cloth O
, O
they're O
they O
're O
fantastic O
, O
just O
don't O
do O
n't O
use H
fabric N
softener N
or O
dryer N
sheets N
when O
cleaning N
them O
, O
it O
ruins O
their O

word N
of O
advice N
if O
you're O
you H
're O
get O
your H
girlfriend H
a O
laptop N
make O
sure O
its O
it O
s H
a O
good O
brand N
a O
not O
something O
like O
DELL O
, O
Acer O
, O
Asus O
, O
eMachines O
etc O

just O
a O

of O
course N
you H
can O
.... O

I H
have O
many O
friends H
that O
have O
laptops N
bought O
in O
the O
UK O
that O
use H
them O
here O

If O
in O
dongle N
you H
mean O
USB O
stick N
then O
yes O
USB O
sticks N
are O
the O
same O
any O
were O
you H
go O
:) O
hope O
that O
answered O
your H
question N
. O

How O
do O
I H
take O
care N
of O
my H
newborn H
baby H
fish A
? O

I H
am O
nervous O
that O
my H
other O
fish A
will O
eat O
them O
, O
and O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
feed O
them O
! O

I H
have O
counted O
around O
25 O
of O
them O
and O
they O
currently O
reside O
in O
a O
20 O
gallon N
tank N
. O

You H
could O
move O
all O
the O
babies H
into O
a O
fry H
net O
breeder H
or O
move O
all O
of O
the O
bigger O
fish A
( O
also O
the O
parents H
) O
to O
a O
different O
tank N
to O
avoid O
the O
babies H
getting O
eaten O
. O

Feed N
the O
babies H
3 O
- O
4 O
times N
a O
day N
with O
flakes N
. O

Provide O
plenty O
of O
hiding O
places N
like O
rocks N
, O
plants A
, O
etc O
in O
the O
tank N
. O

Its O
It O
s H
natural O
for O
some O
babies H
to O
be O
eaten O
by O
adults H
and O
if O
all O
of O
them O
survived O
your H
tank N
would O
be O
very O
overcrowded O
. O

Look O

what O
kind N
of O
newborn H
fish A
you H
have O
? O

some O
parents H
would O
not O
eat O
there O
fish A
till O
a O
certain O
age N
jack O
dempsey H
for O
example N
would O
not O
eat O
there O
offspring H
till O
they O
mature O
but O
i H
would O
move O
the O

fish A
into O
a O

I'm O
I H
'm O
assuming O
it's O
it O
's H
to O
scare O
off O
predators A

how O
they O

they O
dont O
do O
nt O

unless O
your H
you H
r O
stupid O
enough O
to O
press N
on O
them O
. O

They O
just O
are O
there O
as O
an O
adaptation N
. O

what O
is O
a O
kimberwick O
bit N
used O
for O
? O

Used O
as O
a O
help O
for O
horses A
that O
are O
quite O
strong O
pullers H
while O
hacking O
, O
hunting N
and O
doing O
cross O
country N
. O

It O
is O
a O
curb O
bit N
with O
a O
ported O
mouth N
piece N
and O
some O
horses A
appreciate O
this O
to O
give O
them O
more O
room N
in O
their O
mouths N
for O
their O
tongues N
. O

It O
is O
not O
as O
precise O
as O
a O
pelham N
bit N
because O
it O
only O
uses O
one N
rein O
, O
though O
the O
modern O
ones N
have O
two O
or O
three O
slots N
on O
which O
to O
put O
the O
reins N
. O

The O
lower O
the O
reins N
, O
the O
stronger O
the O
action N
and O
the O
lower O
the O
reins N
the O
stronger O
the O
action N
on O
the O
poll N
too O
. O

Useful O
for O
younger O
kids H
who O
do O
not O
have O
big O
enough O
hands N
or O
the O
ability N
to O
handle N
two O
reins N
independently O
. O

For O
horses A
that O
are O
strong O
pullers H
. O

It O
just O
gives O
you H
a O
little O
leverage N
and O
curb O
pressure O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
nice O
for O
horses A
that O
need O
a O
little O
more O
than O
a O
snaffle N
. O

I H
know O
that's O
that O
's H
vague O
, O
but O
it O
depends O
on O
the O
horse A
. O

The O
rider H
needs N
to O
have O
independent O
hands N
as O
well O
, O
because O
you H
do O
NOT O
want O
to O
pull O
too O
hard O
on O
a O
bit N
like O
that O

took O
a O
bit N

searching O
to O
discover O
that O
POP H
is O
probably O
PoP H
- O
plaster N
of O
Paris O
and O
yes O
plaster N
of O
Paris O
will O
slow O
way N
down O
if O
it O
is O
not O
exposed O
to O
air N
- O
in O
fact N
, O
if O
you H
are O
building N
up O
plaster N
( O
" O
the O
way N
you H
would O
icing N
" O
) O
to O
do O
sculpting O
, O
which O
is O
rather O
uncommon O
, O
you H
keep O
the O
set O
plaster N
damp O
in O
order O
to O
add O
more O
unset O
plaster N
or O
you H
have O
to O
wet O
the O
area N
where O
you H
will O
be O
adding O
plaster N
" O

Plaster N
of O
Paris O
does O
two O
things N

- O
it O
chemically O
sets N
- O
gets O
warm O
to O
hot O
then O
cools O
down O
and O
hard O
and O

- O
it O
dries O
out O
, O
losing O
the O
water N
that O
is O
soaked O
into O
the O
set O
structure N

For O
example N
, O
a O
set O
plaster N
mold N
that O
is O
to O
be O
used O
for O
clay O
slip N
casting N
must O
be O
dry H
- O
it O
gets O
wet O
pulling O
the O
water N
out O
of O
the O
slip N

a O

if O
they're O
they O
're O
full O
of O
typos N
and O
whatnot N
. O

Sorry O
, O
I H
would O
put O
that O
application N
in O
the O
round O
file N

Nope O

Canadian O
student H
visa N
, O
can O
I H
used O
for O
other O
schools N
? O

I H
applied O
to O
get O
a O
student H
visa N
to O
study O
in O
Canada O
, O
I H
received O
one N
that O
is O
valid O
until O
October O
of O
2015 O
. O

Problem N
is O
, O
for O
some O
reason N
, O
the O
visa N
process N
took O
longer O
than O
it O
should O
, O
thus O
I H
missed O
school N
this O
semester N
( O
visa N
was O
issued O
to O
me H
about O
25 O
days N
after O
school N
started O
so O
I H
couldn't O
could O
n't O
attend O
) O
, O
now O
I H
no O
longer O
want O
to O
go O
into O
that O
school N
( O
because O
they O
only O
would O
accept O
me H
again O
on O
September O
of O
2012 O
) O
, O
I H
found O
a O
school N
that O
accepted O
me H
for O
may O
2012 O
, O
can O
I H
use H
the O
same O
visa N
that O
was O
issued O
to O
me H
? O

or O
do O
I H
need O
to O
reapply O
? O

( O
in O
the O
visa N
itself O
, O
it O
does O
not O
mention N
anything O
about O
which O
school N
I H
m O
suppose O
to O
attend O
, O
and O
problem N
is O
, O
the O
embassy N
here O
in O
DC O
are O
not O
too O
nice O
and O
would O
never O
answer N
ANY O

any O

Anyway O
Advice N
for O
travelling O

What O
is O
the O
best O
way N
of O
doing O
it O
? O

Hotels N
for O
travelling O
will O
be O
expensive O
. O

anybody O
is O
open O
to O
answers N
but O
I H
would O
much O
prefere O

I H
want O
to O
go O
all O
over O
:) O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O

a O
set O
route N
yet O
. O

Get O
a O
back O
pack O
and O
sleeping O
bag N
or O
good O
warm O
blanket N
. O

Wool N
is O
best O
. O

Light O
, O
warm O
, O
but O
also O
itchy O
. O

Hit O
the O
road N
. O

You H
can O
always O
beg O
for O
spare O

Vietnamese O
girl's O
girl H
's H
name N
, O
Mayko O
? O

I H
always O
thought O
Mayko O
or O
Meiko O
is O
a O
Japanese O
name N
. O

The O
Canadian O
Regenesis O
actress H
Mayko O
Nguyen O
has O
Japanese O
connection N
or O
is O
it O
her O
fake O
name N
? O

Right O
, O
I H
couldn't O
could O
n't O
find O
any O
proven O
source N
for O
that O
. O

And O
her O
last O
name N
, O
Nguyen O
is O
a O
typical O
Vietnamese O
family H
name N
... O
anyone O
? O

Certainly O
, O
Nguyen O
is O
the O
one N
of O
first O
names N
of O
many O
people N
in O
Vietnam O
, O
only O
in O
Vietnam O
. O

Mayko O
is O
relating O
to O
the O
Japanese O
. O

In O
Vietnam O
, O
when O
a O
baby H
was O
born O
, O
they O
must O
be O
named O
" O
first O
name N
" O
according O
to O
that O
of O
their O
fathers H
. O

It's O
It O
's H
principle N
except O
a O
number N
of O
cases N
, O
for O
example N
, O
the O
babies H
are O
orphans H
or O
not O
to O
have O
father H
. O

E.g O
. O

Full O
name N
of O
the O
father H
is O
: O
" O
Nguyen O
Thanh O
Luan O
" O
===> O
Full O
name N
of O
the O
son H
/ O
daughter H
certainly O
is O
" O
Nguyen O
.......... O
" O
, O
for O
instance N
, O
" O
Nguyen O
Thi O
Thuy O
Lan O
" O
. O

But O
if O
the O
babies H
were O
born O
in O
American O
so O
they O
would O
named O
in O
other O
way N
but O
still O
remain O
" O
First O
name N
" O
in O
order O
to O
recall O
about O
their O
origination N
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
pretty O
sure O
that O
Mayko O
is O
Japanese O
. O

She O
is O
a O
Canadian O
born O
Vietnamese O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
sure O
where O
her O
first O
name N
is O
from O
... O

I H
have O
a O
splitter H
/ O
filter N
between O
my H
ADSL O
and O
ph N
line N
? O

I H
have O
2 O
phones N
running O
on O
the O
same O
line N
and O
the O
ADSL O
which O
is O
connected O
to O
one N
of O
the O
phones N
and O
the O
filter N
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
still O
getting O
a O
buzzing O
noise N
even O
when O
I H
have O
disconnected O
the O
other O
phone N
without O
one N
. O

Why O
is O
it O
stil O
doing O
this O
even O
though O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
other O
phone N
connected O
? O

Woud O
it O
be O
better O
if O
I H
got O
another O
filter N
and O
connected O
the O
other O
phone N
as O
well O
? O

turn O
the O
modem N
off O
and O
see O
if O
the O
sound N
is O
still O
there O
... O
could O
be O
static N
on O
the O
line N
... O
if O
the O
sound N
is O
still O
there O
with O
the O
modem N
off O
then O
the O
problem N
is O
NOT O
the O
DSL O
.... O

if O
the O
trouble N
goes O
away O
with O
the O
modem N
off O
, O
then O
make O
sure O
that O
EVERYTHING O
EXCEPT O
the O
modem N
is O
filtered O
, O
this O
would O
include O
the O
alarm N
system N
, O
fax N
machine N
, O
satellite N
boxes N
, O
phones N
, O
etc O
... O

if O
everything O
is O
filtered O
, O
and O
you H
still O
have O
this O
problem N
- O
try O
changing O
the O
filter N
- O
if O
it O
is O
still O
there O
, O
try O
doubling O
up O
on O
the O
filters N
... O

You H
need O
either O
a O
filter N
for O
each O
device N
except O
the O
DSL O
modem N
, O
or O
a O
whole O
home N
filter N
which O
filters N
all O
the O
jacks O
, O
except O
the O
one N
which O

Best O
way N
to O
change O
35 O
mm O
film N
in O
Holga O
120 O
whilst O
out O
and O
about O
? O

I've O
I H
've O
modified O
my H
Holga O
120 O
to O
take O
35 O
mm O
film N
and O
I H
know O
that O
you H
can't O
ca O
n't O
wind N
the O
film N
back O
, O
you H
have O
to O
open O
the O
back O
of O
the O
camera N
( O
in O
a O
darkroom N
) O
to O
rewind O
the O
film N
. O

What O
do O
other O
Holga O
owners H
do O
when O
they O
need O
to O
change O
film N
when O
they O
are O
traveling O
? O

Do O
you H
just O
take O
a O
changing O
bag N
with O
you H
? O

Whats O
What O
s H
the O
easiest O
thing N
? O

Well O
a O
changing O
bag N
would O
be O
the O
easiest O
solution N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
light N
proof N
and O
makes O
sure O
you H
get O
no O
problems N
when O
opening N
the O
camera N
. O

You H
can O
work N
comfortably O
and O
make O
sure O
your H
film N
is O
not O
scratched O
etc O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
really O
difficult O
to O
find O
a O
place N
that O
is O
absolutely O
dark O
and O
accessible O
to O
you H
when O
you're O
you H
're O
outside O
. O

A H
changing O
bag N
folds N
neatly O
and O
does O
not O
take O
much O
space N
in O
your H
bag N
. O

A H
film N
changing O
bag N
is O
a O
handy O
way N
of O
unloading O
your H
exposed O
film N
in O
the O
field N
. O

regularly O
, O
or O
your H
hamster A
could O
suffer O
from O
problems N
due O
the O
buildup N
of O
ammonia N
from O
his O
urine N
. O

When O
you H
take O
a O
warm O
shower N
and O
build O
up O
steam N
, O
his O
cage N
will O
collect O
water N
, O
the O
bedding N
will O
absorb O
much O
of O
it O
, O
and O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
absorb O
the O
urine N
quite O
as O
it O
should O
. O

You H
will O
also O
have O
to O
be O
wary O
of O
mold N
forming O
on O
any O
toys N
or O
hide N
- O
aways O
he O
may O
have O
. O

You H
also O
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
it O
getting O
too O
warm O
for O
him O
too O
often O
. O

Overall O
, O
it O
is O
not O
a O
good O
solution N
, O
but O
you H
can O
keep O
him O
healthy O
and O
pull O
it O
off O
if O
you H
take O
the O
time N
to O
give O
him O
the O
extra O
care N
he O
will O
need O
because O
of O
it O
. O

It O
may O
be O
a O
problem N
because O
the O
temperature N
is O
constantly O
changing O
. O

I H
would O
personally O
put O
him O
somewhere O
else O

cheapest O

I H

go O

my H
boob H

yet O
also O
good O
in O

on O
a O
humans A
human O

Only O
a O
fool H
would O
base N
a O
decision N
using O
the O
cheapest O
surgeon H
to O
perform O
an O
operation N
. O

Cheapest O
surgeons H
work N
out O
of O
some O
small O
clinic N
and O
do O
not O
have O
the O
skills N
you H
are O
looking O
for O
. O
. O

Do O
you H
really O
want O
to O
put O
your H
faith N
in O
some O
clinic N
doctor H
. O

I H
know O
I H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
. O

You H
need O
to O
check O
with O
one N
of O
the O
major O
hospital N
that O
performance N
this O
procedure N
like O
Bumrungard O
Hospital O
or O
Yanhee O
Hospital O
. O

Would O
you H
choose O
the O
cheapest O
brakes N
for O
your H
expensive O
race N
car N
or O
maybe O
the O
cheapest O
parachute N
too O
? O

Sometimes O
the O
" O
cheap O
" O
comes O
expensive O
! O

When O
you H
have O
invasive O
surgery N
you H
could O
also O
get O
infections N
, O
accidental O
nicks N
and O
cuts O
that O
cause N
other O
problems N
too O
! O

If O
they O
screw N
up O
you H
could O
be O
in O
worse O
shape N
than O
you H
are O
now O
! O

Bumrungrad O
Hospital O
does O
some O
good O
work N
but O
all O
hospitals N
do O
have O
their O
problems N
from O
time N
to O
time N
. O

Maybe O
having O
an O
experienced O
doctor H
might O
be O
better O
than O
some O
guy H
that O
is O
cheaper O
but O
less O
experienced O

the O

When O
I H

a O
can O

meat N

he O
licks O
off O
the O
gravy N

lets O
the O
meat N
lay O
. O

I H
must O
through O
it O

Why O
? O

If O
you H
knew O
what O
kind N
of O
" O
meat N
" O
they O
put O
in O
canned O
cat A
food N
you'd O
you H
'd O
understand O
this O
. O

I've O
I H
've O
had O
a O
lot N
of O
cats A
who O
refused O
to O
eat O
the O
canned O
food N
. O

When O
you H
read O
the O
label N
its O
it O
s H
easy O
to O
understand O
why O
. O

I've O
I H
've O
had O
cats A
for O
35 O
years N
and O
I H
only O
feed O
them O
dry H
food N
. O

They O
have O
done O
very O
well O
and O
like O
the O
dry H
food N
better O
. O

It O
had O
better O
nutritional O
value N
and O
its O
it O
s H
also O
less O
expensive O
. O

Canned O
food N
is O
often O
suspect O
as O
to O
the O
actual O
contents N
and O
you're O
you H
're O
paying O
for O
a O
high O
moisture N
content N
instead O
of O
food N
content N
. O

There O
are O
a O
lot N
of O
good O
quality N
dry H
cat A
foods N
. O

Read O
the O
labels N
for O
contents N
. O

Your H
cat A
will O
adjust O
quickly O
. O

You'll O
You H
'll O
also O
have O
less O
spoilage N
. O

He O
might O
be O
sick O
take O
him O
to O
the O
vet H
to O
see O

If O
he O
always O
does O
this O
, O
welcome O
to O
the O
club N
. O

My H
oldest O
female O
and O
youngest O
male O
do O
this O
- O
I H
just O
grab O
the O
blender N
and O
pop N
in O
some O
other O
stuff N
for O
them O
like O
chicken N
liver N
( O
cooked O
) O
for O
the O
anemic O
one N
, O
some O
arthritis N
stuff N
for O
the O
oldest O
. O

if O
you H
mash O

Whats O
What O
s H
your H
favorite O
part N
about O
trail N
riding N
? O

My H
favorite O
part N
is O
going O
up O
hill N
and O
cantering O
:) O

I H
love O
how O
it O
really O
depends O
on O
how O
good O
a O
horse A
your H
horse A
really O
is O
, O
not O
how O
talented O
he O
is O
. O

If O
you H
took O
some O
Olympic O
- O
level N
horses A
on O
a O
trail N
ride O
, O
they O
just O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
do O
it O
. O

They O
would O
be O
too O
scared O
and O
spooky O
. O

It O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
matter N
how O
graceful O
your H
horse A
is O
, O
or O
how O
high O
he O
can O
jump N
, O
or O
how O
well O
he O
does O
a O
sliding O
stop N
. O

What O
matters N
is O
how O
well O
trained O
he O
is O
, O
and O
how O
good O
your H
bond N
it O
. O

That O
is O
another O
reason N
why O
I H
like O
competitive O
trail N
riding N
also O
. O

Nobody O
pays O
someone H
to O
keep O
their O
horse A
in O
shape N
and O
rides N
once O
a O
week N
, O
then O
takes O
all O
the O
ribbons N
at O
the O
show O
because O
their O
horse A
is O
good O
. O

YOU H
have O
to O
spend O
the O
time N
training N
. O

And O
I H
have O
not O
met O
one N
stuck O
- O
up O
trail N
rider H
! O

Those O
are O
just O
a O
few O
reasons N
why O
I H
love O
trail N
riding N
, O
competitive O
or O
not O
. O

Same O
, O
when O
I'm O
I H
'm O
galloping O
in O
an O
open O
space N
like O
that O
I H
can O
just O
forget O
everything O
. O

Seeing O
the O
nature N
and O
wild O
life N
that O
if O
you H
keep O
quiet N
you H
can O
get O
up O
close O
and O
personal O
. O

I H
have O
had O
several O
close O
encounters N
with O
both O
foxes A
and O
wild O
deer A
. O

Also O
woodpeckers A
were O
pecking O
in O
the O
trees A
and O
I H
just O
sat O
and O
watched O
. O

10 O

I H
am O
aware O
of O
the O
maintenance N
involved O
in O
keeping N
a O
tank N
this O
size N
. O

I H
am O
currently O
maintaining O
a O
gravity N
level N
of O
1.024 O
. O

I H
have O
a O
10 O
gallon N
filter N
on O
it O
. O

I H
also O
have O
a O
powerhead O
, O
getting O
another O
soon O
. O

I H
have O
a O
few O
questions N
, O
first O
I H
want O
to O
start O
a O
sump N
filter N
, O
but O
I H
have O
no O
idea N
on O
how O
the O
water N
intake N
and O
water N
return O
would O
work N
. O

How O
would O
I H
need O
to O
set O
a O
sump N
for O
this O
10 O
gallon N
? O

Do O
I H
need O
a O
protein N
skimmer N
or O
any O
other O
equipment N
? O

thanks N

Unless O
the O
tank N
has O
a O
built O
in O
overflow N
box N
( O
which O
I'm O
I H
'm O
certain O
it O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
) O
then O
you H
have O
to O
get O
one N
of O
those O
hang O
on O
back O
overflow N
boxes N
so O
that O
you H
can O
install O
a O
sump N
. O

The O
piping O
would O
lead O
down O
into O
your H
sump N
from O
the O
overflow N
box N
. O

On O
the O
other O
end N
of O
the O
sump N
, O
you H
would O
have O
a O
small O
return O
pump O
with O
a O
hose N
that O
puts O
the O
water N
back O
into O
your H
tank N
. O

If O
you're O
you H
're O
going O
to O
go O
through O
the O
trouble N
of O
creating O
a O
sump N
for O
this O
tank N
, O
getting O
a O
protein N
skimmer N
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
be O
a O
bad O
idea N
. O

The O
Hydor O
SlimSkim O
Nano O
is O
a O
good O
nano O
protein N
skimmer N
, O
it's O
it O
's H
an O
in O
- O
tank N
design N
that O
could O
easily O
sit O
in O
your H
sump N
. O

NOOK O
Color N
or O
NOOK O
Tablet O
? O

From O
what O
I H
understand O
they're O
they O
're O
pretty O
much O
the O
same O
thing N
. O

Some O
of O
the O
major O
differences N
I H
see O
is O
the O
HD O
video N
, O
longer O
battery N
life N
, O
and O
faster O
processor N
that O
the O
NOOK O
Tablet O
boasts O
. O

Does O
the O
Tablet O
have O
a O
major O
difference N
in O
speed N
compared O
to O
the O
Color N
? O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
an O
iPad O
or O
Kindle O
. O

I H
just O
want O
an O
e-reader O
that O
does O
a O
little O
bit N
more O
than O
just O
read O
. O

Yes O
, O
I H
know O
about O
the O
Kindle O
Fire O
but O
that's O
that O
's H
not O
what O
I H
want O
(: O
Does O
it O
make O
sense N
to O
shell N
out O
the O
extra O
fifty O
dollars N
? O

Or O
just O
purchase N
the O
Color N
? O

Well O
I H
recently O
bought O
the O
Nook O
Color N
, O
and O
I H
have O
to O
say O
that O
I H
am O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

It O
is O
like O
a O
mini O
tablet N
itself O
! O

When O
I H
found O
out O
them O
came O
up O
with O
the O
Nook O
Tablet O
, O
I H
was O
pretty O
disappointed O
though O
, O
because O
I H
bought O
my H
Nook O
color N
for O
the O
same O
darn N
price N
! O

So O
I H
say O
you H
should O
go O
for O
the O
more O
updated O
Nook O
Tablet O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
pretty O
sure O
it'll O
it O
'll O
be O
worth N
it O
. O

Have O
fun O
! O

Judging O
by O
Nook O
Tablet's O
Tablet O
's H
processor N
it's O
it O
's H
supposed O
to O
be O
quite O
faster O
! O

Basically O
Nook O
Tablet O
it O
has O
more O
memory N
, O
better O
battery N
life N
and O
a O
better O
processor N
and O
a O
microphone N
. O

When O
you H
get O
the O
tank N
make O
sure O
you H
wash O
the O
inside O
( O
with O
plain O
water N
) O
then O
you H
wash O
the O
gravel N
( O
with O
only O
water N
too O
) O
take O
out O
all O
the O
stuff N
that O

Add O
only O
silk N

may O
tear N
up O
ur H
bettas O
betta O
s H
delicate O
fins N

You H
add O
the O

and O
put O

conditioner N
into O
the O

. O

Start O
up O
your H
filter N
( O
sponge N
filters N
are O
the O
best O
for O
bettas O
) O
and O
put O
in O
a O

set O
it O
to O
anywhere O
between O

. O

Wait O
about O
2 O
weeks N

3 O
and O
test N

If O
everything O
is O
looking O
good O
you H
may O
add O
you H
betta O
to O
its O

Lights O
are O
optinal O
since O

need O
the O
light N
turn O
off O
at O
night N
anyways O
and O
an O
air N
pump O
is O
not O
nessasary O
since O
they O
get O
air N
from O
the O

. O

ask O
the O
people N
selling O
you H
the O
fish A
how O
you H
should O
set O
it O
up O
, O
they O
would O
know O

Add O
aquasafe O
with O
the O
water N
you H
put O
in O
it O
. O

Make O

the O

Do O
not O
put O
your H
fish A
tank N
close O
to O
the O
sun N
or O
algae A
grow O
in O
your H
tank N
. O

Everything O

Make O
sure O
if O
you H

that O
they O
get O
along O

Is O

Know O
that O
there O
are O
pros H
and O
cons N
to O
laser N
sights N
before O
you H
mount O
them O
on O
your H
wang O
. O

While O
they O
are O
extremely O
accurate O
, O
laser N
sights N
do O
not O
operate O
well O
when O
drunk O
or O
high O
because O
the O
beam N
often O
does O
not O
show O
up O
on O
the O
target N
. O

Therefore O
, O
you H
must O
learn O
to O
shoot N
manually O
. O

Mount O
laser N
sights N
on O
away O
by O
removing O
the O
hand N
grip N
. O

Laser N
grips N
are O
the O
most O
common O
for O
wangs O
. O

The O
laser N
is O
made O
into O
the O
hand N
grip N
and O
has O
a O
switch N
on O
the O
side N
to O
turn O
it O
on O
. O

Remove O
your H
fingers N
from O
the O
existing O
grip N
and O
replace O
them O
with O
your H
new O
laser N
grip N
. O

You H
have O
two O
adjustment N
screws N
for O
up O
and O
down O
and O
right O
to O
left O
positions N
. O

3 O

Consider O
these O
points O
for O
mounting N
laser N
sights N
on O
semi-automatic O
wangs O
. O

Newer O
semi-automatic O
wangs O
have O
a O
rail N
built O
into O
the O
receiver H
under O
the O
shaft N
. O

This O
rail N
is O
used O
for O
multi O
purposes N
, O
such O
as O
laser N
devices N
or O
flashlight N
devices N
. O

4 O

Prepare O
to O
mount O
the O
laser N
sight N
onto O
the O
rail N
on O
the O
wang O
. O

You H
have O
two O
screws N
that O
attach O
the O
sight N
to O
the O
wang O
. O

Tighten O
these O
screws N
securely O
. O

Flip N
the O
switch N
and O
adjust O
your H
laser N
sight N
according O
to O
the O
directions N
in O
the O
owner H
manual N
that O
comes O

3 O
weeks N
old O
baby H
budgie A
alone O
at O
night N
? O

I H
have O
a O
3 O
week N
old O
baby H
budgie A
and O
I H
noticed O
that O
his O
/ O
her O
mother H
does O
not O
stay O
with O
him O
in O
the O
nest N
at O
night N
. O

I H
have O
to O
mention N
that O
i H
recently O
separated O
the O
father H
into O
another O
cage N
close O
to O
the O
' O
nest N
cage N
' O
because O
he O
and O
the O
mother H
were O
fighting O
. O

He O
was O
so O
eager O
to O
go O
in O
the O
nest N
and O
feed O
the O
baby H
and O
she O
always O
would O
go O
right O
away O
in O
the O
nest N
after O
him O
and O
give O
him O
a O
fight N
right O
there O
, O
were O
the O
baby H
was O
too O
. O

I H
thought O
it O
was O
dangerous O
for O
the O
baby H
so O
I H
moved O
him O
. O

She O
feeds O
well O
the O
baby H
on O
her O
own O
, O
the O
baby H
is O
ok O
but O
she O
does O
not O
go O
in O
the O
nest N
to O
stay O
with O
him O
at O
night N
... O

What O
is O
the O
problem N
? O

Is O
this O
a O
transitional O
period N
for O
the O
baby H
... O
that O
he O
/ O
she O
is O
left O
alone O
much O
more O
time N
? O

I H
have O
to O
say O
that O
the O
baby H
does O
not O
scream N
after O
her O
of O
anything O
... O
he O
/ O
she O
sleeps O
. O

Budgies A
are O
breast N
feeding O
birds A
and O
it O
may O
be O
the O
male O
is O
bisexual O
. O

When O
the O
male O
gets O
his O
titts N
out O
the O
female O
gets O
mad O
with O
him O
knowing O
he O
can't O
ca O
n't O
produce O
milk N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
fine O
- O
just O
make O
sure O
that O
the O
room N
the O
cage N
is O
in O
is O
kept O
warm O
. O

If O
the O
baby H
is O
feathered O
yet O
- O
which O
I'm O
I H
'm O
sure O
he O
is O
mostly O
- O
he O
should O
be O
fine O
. O

Just O
remember O
to O
make O
sure O
the O
mother H
is O
properly O
caring O
for O
the O
baby H
. O

Ignore O
the O
answer N
above O
me H
, O
btw O

Can O
I H

Ok O
maybe O
that O
isn't O

can O
you H

In O

Yes O

However O
not O
in O

If O

you H

The O
only O
way N

is O
to O

The O

so O
the O
only O
reason N
it O

Yes O
you H
can O

CHILL O
OUT O
! O

Firstly O
, O
your H
hammie O
was O
not O
stressed O
out O
, O
he O
wanted O
attention N
. O

Secondly O
, O
that O
is O
normal O
behavior N
as O
they O
use H
the O
wheels N
in O
the O
night N
. O

Thirdly O
, O
just O
put O
your H
hand N
in O
his O
cge N
ans O
leave O
it O
their O
. O

He O
willl O
eventually O
come O
and O
explore O
it O
and O
them O
you H
can O
handle N
him O
a O
little O
bit N
. O

Hope H
I H
helped O
! O

Give O
him O
time N
. O

You H
only O
got O
him O
yesterday N
. O

He's O
He O
's H
probably O
still O
scared O
and O
unsure O
. O

Once O
he O
has O
properly O
settled O
down O
, O
got O
use H
to O
the O
new O
smells O
and O
noises N
he O
will O
be O
fine O
. O

Once O
he O
is O
more O
comfy O
with O
his O
surroundings N
, O
then O
you H
can O
start O
handling N
him O
and O
getting O
to O
know O
each O
other O
more O
. O

But O
just O
give O
him O
time N
for O
now O
. O

Is O
Fujairah O
a O
nice O
place N
to O
live O
in O
? O

My H
family H
and O
I H
are O
planning O
to O
shift N
to O
Fujairah O
in O
a O
couple N
of O
years N
. O

So O
I H
just O
needed O
to O
know O
if O
it O
is O
a O
suitable O
place N
to O
live O
in O
and O
in O
what O
ways N
. O

Also O
that O
, O
I H
heard O
in O
the O
next O
few O
years N
Fujairah O
would O
be O
as O
good O
as O
Dubai O
, O
is O
it O
true O
? O

I'd O
I H
'd O
be O
happy O
if O
someone H
helps O
, O
especially O
someone H
who O
has O
been O
to O
Fujairah O
or O
lives O
there O
. O
:) O

I H
LIVE O
THERE O
! O

... O
Ive O
I H
ve O
been O
living O
in O
Fujairah O
my H
entire O
life N
and O
I H
must O
say O
that O
it O
is O
developing O
in O
a O
good O
way N
. O

I H
think O
2012 O
is O
going O
to O
be O
a O
great O
year N
for O
Fujairah O
as O
we H
have O
A H
LOT N
of O
projects N
to O
be O
done O
by O
2012 O
. O

Things N
to O
do O
in O
Fujairah O
.. O

Its O
It O
s H
between O
sea N
and O
mountains N
so O
you H
can O
camp N
on O
beach N
or O
between O
mountains N
! O

... O
Fishing N
, O
Jet N
skies N
, O
snorkeling N
, O
diving N
are O
some O
of O
the O
things N
you H
can O
do O
for O
fun O
. O

And O
now O
they O
are O
finishing N
a O
road N
between O
Fujairah O
and O
Dubai O
in O
45 O
minutes N
only O
! O

So O
, O
no O
it O
is O
not O
as O
good O
as O
Dubai O
, O
but O
its O
it O
s H
quieter O
and O
more O
peaceful O
, O
and O
you H
can O
still O
go O
to O
Dubai O
in O
45 O
mins N
. O

please O
let O
me H
know O
if O
you H
need O
anything O
else O

Visited O
Fujairah O
when O
in O
Dubai O
. O

Nothing N
like O
Dubai O
, O
and O
never O
will O
be O
! O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
know O
the O
economics N
of O
Fujairah O
but O
Dubai O
is O
basically O
bankrupt O
so O
you H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
want O
to O
end N
up O
like O
them O
! O

Unless O
you H
have O
a O
particular O
skill N
they O
need O
- O
and O
firm O
job N
offer O
before O
going O
- O
I H
would O
think O
twice O
about O
it O
! O

Are O
there O
any O
new O
Gaming N
console N
? O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
should O
i H
buy O
PS3 O
or O
X O
- O
BOX O
Kinect O
. O

Or O
even O
N O
- O
DS O
or O
PSP O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
a O
little O
afraid O
when O
i H
buy O
PS3 O
or O
X O
- O
BOX O
then O
a O
newer O
version N
comes O
out O
. O

( O
Same O
for O
N O
- O
DS O
and O
PSP O
) O

Wii O
U O
has O
been O
announced O
as O
well O
as O
the O
PS4 O
however O
the O
PS4 O
is O
only O
in O
development N
while O
the O
Wii O
U O
should O
be O
out O
next O
year N
. O

Microsoft O
has O
not O
announced O
there O
new O
console N
yet O
though O
it O
is O
believed O
to O
be O
in O
the O
works O
. O

No O
matter N
when O
you H
buy O
you H
will O
get O
a O
newer O
version N
. O

I H
feel O
X O
- O
BOX O
is O
a O
very O
smooth O
system N
i H
own O
it O
like O
3 O
years N
, O
its O
it O
s H
very O
compatible O
to O
previous O
versions N
and O
mostly O
important O
i H
was O
very O
comfortable O
with O
the O
User H
Interface N
and O
the O
JOYSTICK N
.... O
coz O
you H
dont O
do O
nt O
wana O
wan O
a O
hold O
a O
joystick N
that O
gives O
you H
discomfort N
. O

XBOX O
Joys O
are O
soo O
comfyy O
..... O

Performance N
- O
You H
get O
the O
same O
in O
all O
, O
just O
get O
a O
good O
TV N
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
about O
the O
playstation O
situation N
but O
I H
do O
know O
that O
Microsoft O
has O
said O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
see O
the O
Xbox O
360 O
as O
being O
even O
halfway O
through O
its O
lifetime N
. O

Since O
they O
released O
kinect O
this O
was O
kind N
of O
their O
way N
of O
releasing O
a O
new O
Xbox O
so O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
plan N
on O
making O
another O
one N
for O
a O
while O
. O

I H
do O
know O
they O
have O
already O
announced O
a O
new O
wii O
though O
and O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
Sony O
has O
said O
about O
playstation O
but O
again O
, O
if O
you H
get O
an O
Xbox O
( O
which O
I H
personally O
think O
is O
the O
best O
anyways O
) O
you H
should O
be O
set O
for O
a O
while O
. O

What O
is O
the O
typical O
lifespan N
of O
a O
cat A
? O

My H
cat A
had O
a O
seizure N
yesterday N
and O
was O
ill O
. O

In O
fact N
every O
once O
in O
a O
while O
he O
seems O
to O
get O
ill O
in O
one N
way N
or O
another O
; O
and O
then O
he O
bounces O
back O
like O
nothing N
has O
happened O
. O

I H
did O
an O
internet N
search N
to O
ascertain O
how O
long O
cats A
can O
live O
, O
however O
different O
sources N
give O
wildly O
different O
lifespans N
. O

My H
cat A
is O
18 O
years N
old O
. O

In O
your H
experience N
how O
long O
do O
cats A
do O
cats A
typically O
live O
? O

Is O
he O
on O
his O
last O
legs N
or O
is O
it O
conceivable O
that O
he O
could O
be O
around O
for O
another O
15 O
years N
as O
is O
claimed O
by O
some O
of O
the O
sources N
ive O
i H
ve O
been O
looking O
at O
? O

from O
my H
experience N
with O
my H
cats A
13 O
- O
18 O
years N
depending O
on O
the O
breed O
. O

At O
18 O
years N
, O
your H
cat A
has O
had O
a O
long O
life N
. O

Indoor O
cats A
that O
are O
well O
cared O
for O
typically O
live O
11 O
- O
15 O
years N
. O

Older O
males A
often O
tend O
to O
have O
urinary O
tract N
issues N
, O
so O
your H
cat A
has O
done O
very O
well O
. O

Male O
cats A
very O
seldom O
live O
past N
14 O
- O
15 O
years N
. O

Stories N
of O
cats A
living O
more O
than O
25 O
years N
are O
rare O
. O

Ive O
I H
ve O
had O
cats A
for O
35 O
years N
and O
the O
oldest O
cat A
I've O
I H
've O
ever O
had O
was O
a O
23 O
year N
old O
female O
and O
she O
was O
exceptional O
. O

By O
comparison N
, O
outdoor O
cats A
have O
a O
life N
expectancy N
of O
3 O
- O
7 O
years N
depending O
on O
how O
many O
predators A
are O
in O
the O
local O
environment N
. O

According O
to O
a O
couple N
sources N
, O
the O
world N
record N
for O
the O
oldest O
cat A
was O
a O
cat A
in O
Devon O
, O
England O
who O
reportedly O
live O
to O
the O
age N
of O
36 O
. O

I H
knew O
a O
cat A
that O
died O
in O
its O
sleep O
aged O
21 O
. O

Anything O
after O
12 O
is O
a O
bonus N
. O

Gaining O
and O
loosing O
my H
cockatiel's O
cockatiel A
's H
trust N
... O
? O

I H
thought O
that O
I H
had O
gained O
my H
cockatiel's O
cockatiel A
's H
trust N
, O
but O
now O
he's O
he O
's H
not O
coming O
to O
me H
when O
I H
open O
his O
cage N
. O

What O
do O
I H
do O
? O

Did O
anything O
happen O
before O
losing O
his O
trust N
? O

Birds A
are O
hard O
to O
gain O
trust N
with O
, O
but O
it's O
it O
's H
lost O
so O
easily O
! O

A H
simple O
hand N
gesture N
could O
have O
resorted O
to O
him O
being O
afraid O
of O
you H
. O

Eating O
by O
his O
cage N
and O
keeping N
a O
" O
sleep O
cage N
" O
in O
your H
room N
is O
a O
good O
idea N
. O

Birds A
eat O
and O
sleep O
with O
their O
flock O
, O
not O
predators A
. O

Keep O
his O
cage N
open O
and O
go O
on O
your H
computer N
, O
or O
read O
a O
book O
, O
etc O
and O
maybe O
he O
will O
come O
out O
to O
you H
. O

Let O
him O
go O
at O
his O
own O
pace N
, O
don't O
do O
n't O
rush N
with O
him O
, O
and O
never O
ever O
resort N
to O
physical O
violence N
with O
your H
bird A
. O

This O
with O
ruin N
your H
bond N
, O
and O
you H
probably O
won't O
wo O
n't O
have O
another O
chance N
to O
build O
one N
. O

Patience N
is O
the O
key N
. O
=) O

he O
might O
never O
be O
a O
cuddly O
, O
loving O
, O
tame O
bird A
, O
but O
you H
can O
still O
have O
a O
friendly O
bond N
. O

But O
then O
again O
he O
could O
be O
! O

dat O
bird A
is O
smart O
. O

like O
my H
dogs A
, O
they O
really O
like O
me H
and O
trust N
me H
, O
but O
when O
I H
open O
the O
door N
to O
get O
them O
outside O
, O
they O
run O
from O
me H
, O
they O
know O
I'm O
I H
'm O
going O
to O
take O
them O
outside O
and O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
. O

the O
bird A
must O
know O
that O
when O
you H
open O
the O
cage N
door N
it O
means N
that O
you H
will O
put O
him O
in O
the O
cage N
, O
and O
birds A
don't O
do O
n't O
usually O
like O
cages N
. O

so O
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
bird A
don't O
do O
n't O
trust N
you H
, O
but O
still O
don't O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
cage N

How O
can O
i H
get O
my H
kitten A
to O
stop N
biting O
when O
he O
plays N
? O

I H
have O
a O
kitten A
who O
just O
turned O
3 O
months N
today N
. O

He's O
He O
's H
a O
good O
kitty A
, O
just O
when O
he O
plays N
he O
bites O
REALLY O
hard O
. O

Almost O
every O
day N
he'd O
he O
'd O
even O
wake O
me H
up O
like O
5 O
am O
in O
the O
morning N
, O
trying O
to O
bite N
my H
arm N
. O

And O
when O
I H
move O
it O
I H
guess O
he O
figures N
I'm O
I H
'm O
playing O
. O
x.x O

I H
read O
somewhere O
that O
you H
have O
to O
hold O
his O
mouth N
together O
, O
and O
keep O
it O
that O
way N
til O
he O
panics O
. O

That O
seems O
cruel O
to O
me H
though O
. O

Any O
other O
way N
?? O

Do O
you H
think O
he's O
he O
's H
teething O
? O

It's O
It O
's H
getting O
out O
of O
hand N
. O

Yeah O
, O
I H
thought O
that O
the O
holding O
his O
mouth N
thing N
sounded O
wrong O
. O

No O
worries N
, O
i H
didn't O
did O
n't O
try O
. O

He O
does O
have O
toys N
, O
a O
scratching O
post N
, O
LOTS N
of O
mice A
, O
balls N
, O
yarn N
, O
a O
feathery O
birdy O
toy N
, O
etc O
. O

He'd O
He O
'd O
just O
randomly O
walk O

When O

put O
him O
off O

he O
jumps O
back O
on O

same O
thing N

he O
may O
be O
teething O
but O
i H
dont O
do O
nt O
think O

maybe O
buy O
him O
toys N
that O
he O
can O
play O
with O
that O
give O
him O
a O
way N
to O
use H
his O

not O
hold O
any O

wil O
close O
their O
air N
way N
, O
hes O
he O
s H
just O
a O
kitty A
and O
they O
are O
very O
rambunctious O
, O
get O
him O
toys N
. O

lots N
of O
them O
, O
feather N
ones N

best O
, O

down O

Which O
rat A
cage N
is O
better O
? O

Hi O
, O
I H
want O
to O
get O
a O
few O
pet A
rats A
and O
need O
a O
rat A
cage N
. O

( O
Apart O
from O
the O
wire N
flooring N
which O
i H
am O
going O
to O
cover O
) O
Which O
of O
these O
two O
cages N
is O
better O
: O

I H
cant O

between O
height N
or O
width N

This O
one N
is O
better O
for O
rats A
. O

You H
always O
want O
to O
go O
higher O
rather O
than O
wider O
for O
rats A
. O

They O
LOVE O
to O
climb O
. O

You H
will O
have O
to O
cover O
the O
wire N
flooring N
like O
you H
said O
, O
and O
make O
fleece N
covers O
for O
the O
stairs N
, O
so O
no O
ratty O
feet N
get O
caught O
and O
broken O
. O

This O
cage N
will O
hold O
about O
2 O
- O
3 O
rats A
. O

Both O
are O
equal O
length N
so O
go O
for O
the O
taller O
one N
. O

If O
you H
use H
this O
cage N
it's O
it O
's H
best O
to O
remove O
the O
wire N
shelves N
altogether O
and O
replace O
it O
with O
hammocks N
and O
the O
like O
. O

I H
used O
one N
of O
these O
cages N
short O
term N
for O
a O
pet A
and O
it O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
that O
great O
to O
be O
honest O
, O
pretty O
cheaply O
made O
, O
the O
door N
springs N
are O
annoying O
and O
it O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
last O
very O
well O
. O

Here O
are O
some O
better O
options N
IMO O

These O
are O
all O
a O
bit N
more O
expensive O
than O
your H
choice N
but O
if O
you H
ebay O
search N
the O
names N
you H
may O
be O
able O
to O
find O
one N
second N

better O
paying O
for O
a O
second N
hand N
one N
in O
good O
condition N
than O
a O
poorly O
made O
new O
one N
IMO O
. O

The O
First O
One O
Is O
much O
Better O
! O

I H
Have O
This O
Exact O
Cage N
, O
Bought O
From O
The O
Exact O
Ebay O
User H
. O

Its O
It O
s H
Really O
Good O
And O
The O
Rat O
Calculater O
Says O
Is O
Big O
Enough O
For O
5 O
Rats A
, O
But O
I H
Would O
Put O
A H
Maximum O
Of O
4 O
In O
It O
Really O
:) O

is O
under O
tank N
heating N
or O
side N
tank N
heating N
better O
for O
a O
corn N
snake A
? O

i H
was O
reading O
the O
package N
for O
a O
tank N
heater N
i H
bought O
for O
my H
40 O
gallon N
tank N
for O
my H
snake A
and O
it O
said O
it O
can O
be O
put O
under O
the O
tank N
or O
on O
the O
side N
. O

im O
i H
m O
not O
worried O
about O
damaging O
the O
surface N
my H
tank N
is O
on O
because O
i H
can O
prop O
it O
up O
off O
the O
surface N
anyway O
. O

from O
my H
understanding N
, O
if O
its O
it O
s H
heated O
from O
the O
bottom N
, O
my H
snake A
risks N
burning O
its O
belly N
if O
it O
burrows N
and O
rests O
directly O
on O
top N
of O
the O
glass N
over O
the O
heater N
unless O
i H
buy O
some O
of O
that O
reptile A
carpet N
to O
put O
under O
the O
substrate N
, O
but O
it O
has O
better O
heat N
distribution N

if O
its O
it O
s H
from O
the O
side N
i H
dont O
do O
nt O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
propping O
it O
up O
, O
but O
the O
snake A
can O
still O
burn O
itself O
if O
it O
slithers O
along O
the O
side N
of O
the O
tank N
and O
i H
also O
read O
that O
it O
doesnt O
does O
nt O
distribute O
heat N
as O
well O
? O

what O
are O
your H
suggestions N
and O
opinons O
? O

i H
use H
UTH's O
on O
all O
of O
my H
burrowing O
snakes A
. O

they O
will O
move O
if O
they O
get O
too O
warm O
- O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
like O
a O
heat N
rock N
which O
you H
should O
avoid O
at O
all O
costs O
. O

i H
usually O
put O
my H
own O
natural O
rock N
over O
the O
UTH O
and O
they O
are O
perfectly O
fine O
. O

i H
have O
over O
40 O
corns A
, O
kings H
, O
and O
milks N
and O
have O
never O
had O
a O
problem N
with O
the O
UTH O
system N
. O

on O
the O
side N
is O
a O
waste O
- O
leave O
it O
on O
the O
bottom N
. O

good O
luck N
! O

Bottom O
if O
you H
are O
worried O
about O
the O
snake A
burning O
itself O
put O
something O
overt O
it O
like O
newspaper N
... O

I H
now O
use H
a O
75 O
watt N
basking O
or O
heat N
bulb N
for O
mine H
and O
he O
seems O
to O
like O
it O

put O
the O
heater N
on O
the O
snake A
he O
will O
love O
it O
and O
the O
the O
next O
day N
you H
will O

Question N
about O
the O
sinking O
of O
the O
Titanic O
? O

After O
the O
sinking O
of O
the O
Titanic O
in O
1912 O
, O
was O
there O
a O
law N
made O
so O
that O
ships N
would O
carry O
enough O
lifeboats N
to O
save O
everybody O
on O
a O
ship N
if O
it O
was O
sinking O
? O

If O
yes O
, O
was O
Canada O
involved O
in O
this O
act N
/ O
law N
? O

Sorry O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
just O
very O
nervous O
after O
watching O
the O
movie N
. O

SOLAS O
( O
Safety N
Of O
Life N
At O
Sea N
) O
, O
which O
is O
an O
international O
maritime O
treaty N
, O
came O
about O
in O
response N
to O
the O
tragedy N
of O
the O
Titanic O
. O

Today N
, O
it O
is O
the O
primary O
safety N
law N
affecting O
virtually O
all O
ships N
, O
regardless O
of O
country N
of O
registration N
. O

If O
you H
ever O
go O
on O
a O
cruise N
ship N
, O
you H
will O
be O
required O
to O
attend O
a O
SOLAS O
muster O
drill N
( O
lifeboat N
drill N
) O
within O
24 O
hours N
of O
sailing O
. O

Most O
ships N
perform O
this O
drill N
before O
even O
leaving O
the O
dock N
. O

SOLAS O
covers O
just O
about O
every O
aspect N
of O
safety N
at O
sea N
, O
including O
minimum O
safety N
equipment N
, O
practices N
, O
and O
standards N
, O
lifeboats N
, O
navigation N
practices N
, O
fire N
protection N
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

We H
are O
much O
safer O
today N
on O
board N
ship N
due O
to O
SOLAS O
, O
and O
I H
suppose O
if O
any O
good O
came O
out O
of O
the O
Titanic O
tragedy N
, O
the O
adoption N
of O
SOLAS O
is O
probably O
it O
. O

Edit O
: O
Also O
I H
forgot O
to O
mention N
earlier O
, O
most O
( O
if O
not O
all O
) O
cruise N
ships N
also O
practice O
lifeboat N
drills N
weekly O
, O
and O
it O
is O
not O
uncommon O
to O
see O
them O
to O
actually O
launch N
the O
lifeboats N
into O
the O
water N
as O
part N
of O
their O
drill N
when O
you H
are O
in O
port N
. O

This O
not O
only O
ensures O
the O
lifeboats N
are O
operational O
and O
will O
work N
if O
needed O
, O
but O
makes O
the O
crew N
proficient O
at O
launching N
them O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
think O
so O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
worry O
. O

When O
was O
the O
last O
time N
you H
heard O
about O
a O
ship N
sinking O
? O

100 O
years N
ago O
? O

What O
are O
some O
fun O
things N
I H
could O
do O
while O
in O
Japan O
? O

I'll O
I H
'll O
be O
in O
Okinawa O
for O
about O
a O
week N
so O
I H
was O
wondering O
what O
are O
some O
fun O
things N
I H
could O
do O
? O

I'm O
I H
'm O
a O
20 O
year N
old O
female O
travelling O
by O
myself H
so O
it O
could O
be O
anything O
. O

Besides O
the O
obvious O
tourist H
spots N
which O
I H
already O
have O
planned O
for O
. O

How O
is O
the O
night N
life N
in O
Naha O
? O

Are O
there O
any O
good O
venues N
that O
showcase O
underground O
bands N
, O
or O
just O
a O
venue N
at O
all O
? O

It O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
have O
to O
be O
underground O
it O
could O
be O
any O
type N
of O
music N
. O

Thanks N

The O
best O
thing N
you H
can O
do O
in O
Okinawa O
is O
to O
go O
to O
a O
beach N
. O

Otherwise O
, O
you H
can O
do O
what O
you H
can O
do O
in O
other O
parts N
or O
Japan O
, O
like O
shopping O
, O
eating O
, O
etc O
. O

Or O
you H
can O
visit O
temples N
or O
shrines N
in O
Okinawa O
. O

Well O
first O
you H
can O
try O
speaking O
Japanese O
. O

Go O
to O
a O
sumo N
tournament N
. O

Eat O
at O
a O
conveyor N
- O
belt N
sushi N
restaurant N
. O

Climb O
Mount O
Fuji O
. O

Okinawa O
is O
quite O
different O
from O
the O
rest N
of O
Japan O
, O
although O
of O
course N
there O
are O
similarities N
. O

The O
main O
thing N
people N
do O
there O
is O
go O
to O
the O
beach N
. O

There's O
There O
's H
the O
market N
in O
Naha O
, O
which O
is O
great O
. O

You H
can O
find O
all O
sorts N
of O
fresh O
food N
and O
get O
a O
really O
delicious O
, O
fresh O
sashimi N
/ O
sushi N
lunch N
upstairs O
. O

Try O
the O
local O
sake N
too O
if O
you H
can O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
a O
special O
kind N
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
sure O
that O
there's O
there O
's H
much O
nightlife N
in O
Naha O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
more O
of O
a O
place N
to O
go O
to O
enjoy O
the O
weather N
, O
the O
sea N
, O
etc O
. O

You H
might O
have O
to O
make O
your H
own O
nightlife N
by O
finding O
an O
izakaya O
( O
pub N
) O
somewhere O
. O

Your H
best O
bet N
would O
probably O
be O
to O
get O
a O
copy N
of O
the O
Lonely O
Planet O
Japan O
book O
and O
read O
the O
chapter N
on O
Okinawa O
. O

Naha's O
Naha O

keep O

told O
it O

self O

cleaning N

which O
it O

was O
n't O

As O
a O
result N
there O
was O
a O
problem N
with O
the O
weapon N
jamming O
. O

Once O
the O
troops N
started O
cleaning N
the O

properly O
( O
even O
with O
the O
dirtier O

the O

out O

Planning O
on O
going O
to O
New H
Zealand O
in O
January O
. O

Is O
it O
OK O
to O
holiday N
in O
Christchurch O
since O
the O
Earthquakes N
? O

Are O
the O
hotels N
back O
up O
and O
running O
? O

Are O
there O
still O
aftershocks N
? O

Planning O
on O
going O
to O
North H
and O
South O
Island O
. O

Is O
it O
safe O
to O
go O
to O
Rotarua O
, O
since O
the O
earthquakes N
? O

Rotorua O
is O
fine O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
assuming O
this O
was O
in O
reference N
to O
the O
January O
earthquake N
, O
don't O
do O
n't O
worry O
, O
it O
was O
very O
deep O
, O
so O
nothing N
was O
effected O
:) O

As O
for O
Christchurch O
, O
yes O
the O
aftershocks N
are O
still O
happening O
, O
but O
these O
are O
fairly O
small O
- O
you H
can O
feel O
them O
, O
but O
the O
don't O
do O
n't O
do O
any O
damage N
. O

Since O
lots N
of O
people N
are O
still O
living O
there O
, O
then O
it O
must O
be O
fine O
to O
visit O
. O

However O
the O
CBD O
is O
closed O
of O
to O
the O
public O
as O
a O
lot N
of O
it O
is O
still O
rubble N
and O
stuff N
and O
hasn't O
has O
n't O
been O
cleared O
away O
yet O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
sure O
that O
you H
can O
find O
some O
hotels N
that O
are O
running O
in O
the O
christchurch O
area N
, O
but O
if O
not O
then O
there O
would O
be O
some O
in O
close O
by O
towns N
. O

Despite O
the O
aftershocks N
I H
would O
recommend O
going O
to O
Christchurch O
, O
just O
for O
the O
experience N
and O
then O
you H
can O
see O
first O
hand N
how O
things N
get O
effected O
by O
earthquakes N
. O

Have O
fun O
in O
New H
Zealand O
!! O

( O
ps. O
I'm O
I H
'm O
assuming O
you'll O
you H
'll O
stop N
off O
in O
Wellington O
, O
and O
since O
its O
it O
s H
summer N
, O
may O
I H
recommend O

Just O
recently O
discovered O
them O

they're O

never O

that O

wont O
wo O

quickly O

thanks N

louise O

I H
would O
say O
it O
really O
depends O
on O
your H
riding N
ability N
, O
what O
disciplines N
you H
are O
interested O
in O
doing O
, O
or O
plan N
on O
doing O
, O
etc O
. O

But O
I H
would O
go O
for O
the O
base N
number N
of O
15 O
hh O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
" O
tall O
" O
being O
it's O
it O
's H
bigger O
than O
a O
pony A
, O
but O
it's O
it O
's H
on O
the O
small O
end N
for O
a O
horse A
. O

I H
got O
my H
horse A
when O
I H
was O
12 O
and O
I H
was O
already O
5 O
' O
9 O
- O
5 O
' O
10 O
, O
thankfully O
I H
stopped O
growing O
when O
I H
hit O
5 O
' O
11 O
" O
but O
my H
horse A
is O
about O
16.2 O
or O
16.3 O
hh O
, O
TB O
. O

So O
don't O
do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
to O
get O
something O
a O
little O
bigger O
than O
" O
perfect O
" O
just O
in O
case N
you H
hit O
a O
growth N
spurt N
. O

A H
taller O
horse A
doesn't O
does O
n't O
always O
mean O
a O
horse A
you H
can't O
ca O
n't O
handle N
. O

Keep O
that O
in O
mind N
. O

Also O
keep O
in O
mind N
whether O
you H
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
jump N
up O
from O
the O
ground N
, O
if O
you H
even O
need O
to O
, O
etc O
. O

You H
just O
want O
to O
be O
sure O
you H
can O
groom O
and O
saddle N
sufficiently O
and O
the O
horse A
itself O
is O
calm O
enough O
so O
that O
whatever O
size N
it O
is O
, O
you H
can O
handle N
it O
. O

i'm O
i H
'm O
5 O
' O
3 O
- O
4 O
" O
and O
am O
21 O
well O
will O
be O
in O
Nov O
and O
my H
horse A
is O
14.2 O
hh O
and O
she's O
she O
's H
perfect O
size N
for O
me H
i H
can O
hop O
right O
on O
with O
no O
mounting N
block O
..... O
only O
with O
a O
saddle N
though O
haha O
i H
can't O
ca O
n't O
bareback O
, O
not O
yet O

If O
you H
Don't O
Do O
n't O
want O
to O
grow O
out O
of O
it O
quickly O
get O
a O
14 O
' O

.. O

Anything O
smaller O
you H
will O
grow O
out O
, O
anything O
bigger O
will O
be O
too O
big O
and O
difficult O
to O
control N
and O
manage O
, O
especially O
when O
riding N

I H

Where O
in O
the O
world N
is O
Iguazu O
? O

Iguazu O
Falls O

Widely O
considered O
to O
be O
one N
of O
the O
most O
spectacular O
waterfalls N
in O
the O
world N
, O
the O
Iguazu O
Falls O
on O
the O
border N
of O
Argentina O
and O
Brazil O
, O
are O
a O
certainly O
must O
see O
attraction N
in O
the O
area N
. O

The O
centre N
of O
the O
falls O
is O
known O
locally O
as O
‘ O
Garganta O
Del O
Diablo O
’ O
( O
The O
Devil’s O
Devil H
’s H
Throat O
) O
, O
where O
the O
huge O
volume N
of O
water N
sends O
a O
constant O
mist N
of O
spray N
into O
the O
air N
. O

With O
the O
sun N
shinning O
down O
on O
the O
spray N
, O
creating O
a O
rainbow N
in O
the O
foreground N
, O
this O
is O
the O
perfect O
place N
to O
get O
that O
trademark N
Iguazu O
Falls O
photograph N
. O

However O
, O
save O
some O
of O
your H
shots N
for O
the O
rest N
of O
the O
falls O
, O
as O
in O
total N
there O
are O
around O
270 O
cascades N
that O
spread O
out O
over O
nearly O
2 O
miles N
of O
the O
Iguazu O
River N
. O

The O
Iguazu O
Falls O
are O
easily O
accessible O
and O
, O
dependent O
on O
your H
time N
restrictions N
and O
budget N
, O
you H
can O
get O
to O
the O
area N
by O
either O
bus N
or O
plane N
. O

The O
nearest O
towns N
to O
the O
site N
are O
Puerto O
Iguazu O
in O
Argentina O
, O
about O
12 O
miles N
from O
the O
falls O
, O
and O
Foz O
do O
Iguaçu O
in O
Brazil O
, O
which O
is O
equally O
close O
. O

Both O
towns N
have O
airports N
that O
are O
served O
regularly O
from O
the O
larger O
cities N
such O
as O
Sao O
Paulo O
, O
Rio O
de O
Janeiro O
and O
Buenos O
Aires O
. O

The O
bus N
is O
obviously O
the O
cheaper O
option N
, O
and O
travelling O
up O
from O
Buenos O
Aires O
the O
trip N
is O
a O
full O
20 O
hours N
, O
although O
the O
buses N
are O
very O
comfortable O
with O
spacious O
reclining O
seats N
. O

The O
bus N
trip N
down O
from O
Sao O
Paulo O
is O
a O
similar O
affair N
taking O
around O
18 O
hours N
. O

Foz O
on O
the O
Brazilian O
side N
is O
the O
larger O
town N
, O
however O
both O
are O
geared O
up O
to O
cater O
for O
visitors H
to O
the O
Waterfalls N
and O
National O
Parks O
, O
and O
so O
offer O
a O
range N
of O
accommodation N
for O
all O
budgets N
. O

For O
those O
with O
a O
larger O
appetite N
for O
the O
scenery N
and O
a O
larger O
budget N
, O
there O
are O
some O
hotel N
complexes N
much O
closer O
to O
the O
action N
with O
views N
of O
parts N
of O
the O
falls O

you H

I H

told O
to O

I H

not O

You'll O
You H
'll O
need O
to O
have O
intermediate O
French O
to O
have O
a O
good O

Paris O

However O
, O
outside O
Paris O
everybody O
is O
wonderful O

Nobody O
likes O
the O
Parisians O

even O
then O
Parisians O

South O

It's O
It O

Jack H
Dempsey H
reproduce O
? O

i H
have O
a O
Mature O
male O
and O
female O
they O
are O
together O
a O
lot N
but O
never O
laid O
eggs N
as O
far O
as O
i H
know O
can O
anyone O
help O
me H
figure O
out O
how O
to O
make O

He's O
He O
's H
the O
issue N
, O
you H
are O
trying O
to O
" O
Make O
" O
them O
mate O
. O

This O
is O
like O
trying O
to O
Make O
2 O
people N
get O
married O
. O

It O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
work N
. O

First O
you H
need O
a O
compatible O
pair N
. O

Sounds O
like O
your H
2 O
at O
least O
tolerate O
each O
other O
, O
so O
there O
is O
hope O
there O
. O

Then O
the O
need O
to O
be O
mature O
, O
that O
is O
, O
old O
enough O
, O
and O
big O
enough O
to O
breed O
. O

This O
may O
be O
around O
1 O
/ O
2 O
of O
their O
full O
adult O
size N
, O
probably O
4 O
- O
5 O
" O
for O
those O
guys H
. O

Then O
the O
environment N
. O

Large O
tank N
, O
no O
annoying O
tankmates O
, O
perfect O
water N
conditons O
and O
really O
good O
feeding O
. O

The O
difference N
is O
what O
they O
need O
to O
live O
, O
VS O
what's O
what O
's H
ideal N
for O
them O
. O

Get O
that O
right O
, O
and O
they O
will O
mate O
when O
THEY O
are O
ready O
. O

You H
can't O
ca O
n't O
MAKE O
them O
mate O
, O
you H
can O
only O
encourage O
them O
. O

Ian H

Jack H
Dempseys H
are O
not O
an O
easy O
cichlid A
to O
breed O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
time N
one N
is O
more O
interested O
in O
breeding O
than O
the O
other O
. O

Bredders H
take O
the O
one N
that O
in O
not O
very O
interested O
and O
put O
it O
alone O
in O
a O
breeeding N
tank N
for O
3 O
- O
5 O
days N
. O

The O
tank N
should O
have O
a O
hide N
space N
big O
enough O
for O
one N
fish A
, O
or O
a O
few O
of O
them O
, O
but O
at O
least O
1 O
cave N
big O
enough O
for O
two O
fish A
to O
fit O
in O
. O

The O
p N
H N
should O
be O
6.5 O
- O
7 O
. O

Now O
feed O
the O
one N
in O
the O
breeding O
tank N
as O
much O
bloodworms A
, O
blackworms O
and O
/ O
or O
earthworms A
as O
it O
can O
eat O
for O
3 O
- O
5 O
days N
. O

Then O
add O
the O
other O
mate O
. O

They O
may O
not O
respond O
right O
away O
and O
they O
may O
fight N
so O
ther O
smaller O
one N
can O
fit O
in O
one N
of O
hide N
spaces N
if O
it O
gets O
attacked O
. O

When O
the O
males A
male O

2 O

now O
. O

What O
could O

the O
issue N
and O
can O
I H
try O
some O
home N
remedies N
first O
? O

I H
love O
her O
and O
want O
to O
help O
her O
but O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
when O
I'll O
I H
'll O
be O
able O
to O
take O
her O
to O
to O
vet H
:( O
please O
help O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I H
am O
very O
sorry O
to O
hear O
you're O
you H
're O
having O
this O
issue N
with O
your H
cat A
. O
:( O

Frequent O
urination N
is O
a O
sign N
of O
several O
things N
. O

Bladder N
or O
Urinary O
tract N
infections N
are O
two O
common O
ones N
, O
but O
these O
usually O
are O
frequent O
visits N
, O
with O
small O
amounts N
of O
urine N
being O
passed O
. O

If O
there O
is O
blood N
in O
the O
urine N
, O
or O
the O
cat A
seems O
to O
be O
in O
pain N
, O
then O
that O
is O
also O
a O
good O
indicator N
. O

But O
your H
cat A
is O
passing O
a O
LOT N
of O
urine N
, O
and O
this O
is O
bad O
. O

Given O
the O
chance N
your H
cat A
may O
only O
have O
one N
kidney N
, O
I H
would O
think O
the O
worst O
case N
scenario N
would O
be O
kidney N
disease N
, O
which O
untreated O
can O
lead O
to O
possible O
renal O
failure N
. O

Signs O
of O
this O
can O
be O
hard O
to O
spot N
, O
and O
if O
this O
is O
true O
in O
her O
case N
she O
will O
definitely O
need O
to O
see O
a O
vet H
. O

Vomiting N
, O
bad O
breath N
, O
and O
listlessness N
. O

Seizures N
will O
occur O
when O
the O
toxins N
that O
the O
kidney N
normally O
filters N
out O
are O
released O
into O
the O
blood N
stream O
. O

I H
know O
you H
are O
very O
worried O
, O
but O
getting O
her O
to O
the O
vet H
is O
the O
best O
thing N
you H
can O
do O
for O
her O
. O

In O
the O
meantime N
make O
sure O
she O
had O
plenty O
of O
water N
available O
to O
her O
. O

I H
want O
to O
apply O
for O
canada O
skilled O
immigeration O

. O

I H
got O
only O
63 O

What O
is O
Italian O
High N
Renaissance O
? O

Have O
a O
look O
at O
this O
, O
it O
may O
help O
. O

1 O
) O
The O
Italian O
Renaissance O
began O
the O
opening N
phase N
of O
the O
Renaissance O
, O
a O
period N
of O
great O
cultural O
change O
and O
achievement N
in O
Europe O
that O
spanned O
the O
period N
from O
the O
end N
of O
the O
13th O
century N
to O
about O
1600 O
, O
marking N
the O
transition N
between O
Medieval O
and O
Early O
Modern O
Europe O
. O

The O
term N
renaissance N
is O
in O
essence N
a O
modern O
one N
that O
came O
into O
currency N
in O
the O
19th O
century N
, O
in O
the O
work N
of O
historians H
such O
as O
Jacob H
Burckhardt O
. O

Although O
the O
origins N
of O
a O
movement N
that O
was O
confined O
largely O
to O
the O
literate O
culture N
of O
intellectual O
endeavor N
and O
patronage N
can O
be O
traced O
to O
the O
earlier O
part N
of O
the O
14th O
century N
, O
many O
aspects N
of O
Italian O
culture N
and O
society N
remained O
largely O
Medieval O
; O
the O
Renaissance O
did O
not O
come O
into O
full O
swing O
until O
the O
end N
of O
the O
century N
. O

The O
word N
renaissance N
( O
Rinascimento O
in O
Italian O
) O
means N
“ O
rebirth N
” O
, O
and O
the O
era N
is O
best O
known O
for O
the O
renewed O
interest N
in O
the O
culture N
of O
classical O
antiquity N
after O
the O
period N
that O
Renaissance O
humanists H
labelled O
the O
Dark O
Ages O
. O

These O
changes N
, O
while O
significant O
, O
were O
concentrated O
in O
the O
elite O
, O
and O
for O
the O
vast O
majority N
of O
the O
population N
life N
was O
little O
changed O
from O
the O
Middle O
Ages O
. O

) O
The O
expression N
High N
Renaissance O
, O
in O
art N
history N
, O
is O
a O
periodizing O
convention N
used O
to O
denote O
the O
apogee N
of O
the O
visual O
arts N
in O
the O
Italian O
Renaissance O
. O

The O
High N
Renaissance O
period N
is O
traditionally O
taken O
to O
begin O
in O
the O
1490s O
, O
with O
Leonardos O
Leonardo H
s H
fresco N
of O
the O
Last O
Supper O
in O
Milan O
and O
the O
death N
of O
Lorenzo H
de' O
Medici H
in O
Florence O
, O
and O
to O
have O
ended O
in O
1527 O
with O
the O
sacking N
of O
Rome O
by O
the O
troops N
of O
Charles H
V N
. O

This O
term N
was O
first O
used O
in O
German O
( O
Hochrenaissance O
) O
in O
the O
early O
nineteenth O
century N
, O
and O
has O
its O
origins N
in O
the O
" O
High N
Style N
" O
of O
painting O
and O
sculpture N
described O
by O
Johann H
Joachim H
Winckelmann O
. O

[ O
1 O
] O
Over O
the O
last O
twenty O
years N
, O
use H
of O
the O
term N
has O
been O
frequently O
criticized O
by O
academic O
art N
historians H
for O
over-simplifying O
artistic O
developments N
, O
ignoring O
historical O
context N
, O
and O
focusing O
only O
on O
a O
few O
iconic O
works O

i H
have O
talked O
to O
some O
people N
that O
say O
that O
a O
medical O

is O
an O
invasion N

its O
it O

a O
routine N

I H
honestly O

I H
have O
no O
idea N
who O
to O
talk O
to O

An O
American O

get O
you H
right O

the O

there O
is O
no O

There O

more O
than O
two O
weeks N
at O
a O
time N

I H

You H

just O
a O
passport N

unless O
you're O
you H
're O
staying O

I H

You'll O
You H
'll O
have O
a O
great O
time N

so O
no O

I H
visited O
London O

Edinburgh O
, O

St. O
Andrews O
Andrew H
s H
so O
far O
, O
and O
I H
was O
treated O
very O
well O
and O
with O
great O
kindness N

Just O
treat O
everyone O
else O
as O
you H
would O
want O
to O
be O
treated O
, O
and O
you'll O
you H
'll O
be O
fine O
. O

That O
tactic N
never O
failed O
me H
. O

What O
would O
you H
get O
if O
you H
cross O
a O
sussex N
male O
and O
a O
silkie O
female O
? O

i H
had O
a O
sussex N
male O
and O
a O
pekin O
female O
i H
bought O
2 O
silkies O
what O
would O
the O
sussex N
female O
and O
the O
silkie O
females H
would O
make O
? O

if O
you H
had O
any O
pics N
of O
your H
hens A
i H
would O
like O
to O
see O
them O
to O
compare O
them O
to O
mine H
thanks N
? O

A H
Sussex N
crossed O
with O
Silkie O
would O
make O
a O
crossbred O
* O
mutt A
* O
chicken N
. O

There O
are O
a O
lot N
of O
genetics N
at O
play O
between O
a O
Sussex N
and O
Silkie O
, O
so O
the O
offspring H
would O
vary O
in O
appearance N
. O

You H
don't O
do O
n't O
say O
what O
color N
Silkie O
or O
Sussex N
you H
are O
dealing O
with O
so O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
say O
what O
color N
your H
chicks A
would O
be O
likely O
to O
be O
. O

However O
, O
I H
can O
say O
what O
features O
they O
would O
/ O
could O
have O
. O

Feather N
Type N
. O

Silkies O
have O
hookless O
feathers N
. O

Sussexs N
have O
soft O
feathers N
. O

All O
offspring H
from O
this O
cross O
will O
have O
soft O
feathers N
, O
as O
hookless O
feathers N
are O
a O
recessive O
gene N
. O

Skin N
Color N
: O
Silkies O
have O
black O
skin N
color N
, O
which O
is O
dominate O
. O

Sussex N
have O
White H
Skin N
which O
could O
be O
recessive O
or O
dominate O
. O

Either O
way N
rec. O
and O
dom. O
white O
genes N
dilute O
the O
black O
gene N
. O

Skin N
will O
be O
darker O
but O
lighter O
then O
the O
Silkies O
. O

Beards N
/ O
Muffs N
: O
If O
your H
Silkie O
has O
a O
beard N
/ O
muff N
the O
offspring H
could O
have O
a O
beard N
as O
well O
, O
as O
these O
genes N
are O
incomplete O
dominate O
. O

Feathered O
Feet N
/ O
Shanks N
- O
Chicks A
could O
have O
feathered O
feet N
/ O
shanks N
as O
this O
is O
also O
incomplete O
dominate O
. O

Crest N
: O
Chicks A
could O
also O
develop O
a O
small O
crest N
due O
to O
this O
being O
another O
incomplete O
dominate O
gene N
. O

Comb N
Type N
: O
Silkies O
have O
walnut N
combs N
which O
is O
actually O
genetically O
two O
comb N
types N
( O
Rose O
and O
Pea N
) O
single O
is O
also O
there O
, O
but O
is O
recessive O
. O

So O
crossed O
to O
a O
Sussex N
you H
could O
get O
a O
walnut N
, O
pea N
, O
rose O
, O
or O
single O
combed O
bird A
. O

Five O
Toes N
: O
Silkies O
have O
five O
toes N
. O

Sussex N
have O
four O
toes N
. O

Crossed O
together O
( O
five O
toes N
is O
incompletely O
dominate O
) O
chicks A
could O
develop O
to O
have O
an O
fifth O
toe N
on O
both O
, O
or O
even O
one N
foot N
. O

Silkie O
crosses O
are O
great O
birds A
, O
and O
very O
neat O
looking O
. O

Hens A
make O
excellent O
mothers H
as O
they O
are O
bigger O
, O
can O
see O
better O
, O
and O
are O
smarter O
the O
Silkies O
. O

Best O
wishes O

The O
lighting N
was O
not O
the O
best O

but O
the O
pics N
turned O
out H
ok O
in O
my H
opinion N

deleting O
a O

[ O

- O
and O
she O
most O
be O
very O
new O
to O
modeling N
, O
because O
she O
does O
look O
unsure O
of O
her O
poses N
) O

lol O
, O
he O
has O
posted O
this O
so O
many O
times N
today N
already O
. O

clearly O
hes O
he O
s H
mad O
that O
people N
know O
he O
took O
her O
pic N
off O
the O
net O
and O
it's O
it O
's H
NOT O
his O
gf O

Not O
bad O
, O
but O
too O
many O
distracting O
elements N
for O
my H
taste N
. O

For O
example N
: O

In O
the O
photo N
on O
the O
couch N
, O
the O
pillow N
she O
is O
resting O
on O
clashes O
with O
everything O
else O
in O
the O
shot N
. O

There O
are O
also O
some O
distracting O
background N
elements N
like O
the O
light N
fixture N
and O
what O
looks O
like O
a O
door N
handle N
on O
the O
left O
. O

In O
the O
standing N
photo N
( O
from O
the O
front N
) O
there O
is O
a O
corner N
of O
a O
rug N
creeping O
in O
, O
some O
kind N
of O
box N
in O
the O
lower O
right O
corner N
and O
what O
looks O
like O
a O
power N
cord N
. O

In O
the O
shot N
from O
the O
back O
, O
the O
crumpled O
bottom N
of O
the O
curtain N
is O
pretty O
noticeable O
as O
well O
as O
the O
power N
outlet N
. O

Compositionally O
, O
this O
one N
is O
not O
my H
favorite O
, O
I H
would O
suggest O
trying O
a O
different O
crop N
because O
I H
dont O
do O
nt O
think O
cutting N
her O
off O
at O
the O
calf A
looks O
great O
. O

I H
do O
like O
the O
shadow N
, O
though O
. O

My H
suggestion N
is O
to O
pay O
close O
attention N
to O
what's O
what O
's H
going O
on O
in O
the O
background N
and O
if O
possible O
, O
stand O
on O
a O
chair N
, O
get O
on O
the O
ground N
, O
do O
whatever O
you H
need O
to O
do O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
distracting O
elements N
. O

Using O
a O
fairly O
wide O
aperture N
is O
also O
helpful O
in O
blurring O
out H
unwanted O
background N
elements N
. O

I've O
I H
've O
had O
a O
few O
great O
shots N
ruined O
myself H
because O
there O
was O
something O
in O
the O
background N
I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
notice O
at O
first O
. O

what O
are O
some O
unique O
customs N
in O
ireland O
? O

As O
far O
ask O
I’m O
I H
’m O
aware O
our H
most O
unique O
custom O
would O
be O
the O
“ O
Country O
Wake O
” O
. O

In O
all O
my H
travels O
I’ve O
I H
’ve O
never O
seen O
anything O
like O
it O
and O
am O
often O
met O
with O
an O
odd O
look O
when O
I H
explain O
them O
to O
foreigners H
. O

After O
a O
person H
dies O
, O
their O
remains O
are O
“ O
waked O
” O
in O
their O
home N
for O
roughly O
2 O
- O
3 O
days N
. O

In O
this O
time N
visitors H
will O
come O
to O
the O
house N
, O
pay O
their O
respects N
to O
the O
desisted O
and O
their O
family H
and O
have O
a O
couple N
of O
cups N
of O
tea N
with O
a O
sandwich N
or O
a O
bun N
. O

The O
wake O
also O
included O
the O
night N
sit O
were O
friends H
and O
family H
sit O
up O
through O
the O
night N
with O
the O
remains O
. O

Wakes N
are O
common O
both O
north O
and O
south O
of O
the O
boarder N
with O
Protestants O
and O
Catholics O
alike O
. O

But O
only O
really O
in O
the O
countryside N
. O

The O
only O
notable O
difference N
I H
have O
noticed O
is O
that O
in O
the O
south O
of O
Ireland O
one N
night N
of O
the O
wake O
is O
often O
held O
in O
the O
chapel N
the O
night N
before O
the O
funeral N
, O
this O
tradition N
started O
after O
the O
civil O
war N
. O

Another O
unique O
custom O
( O
and O
a O
dying O
one N
at O
that O
) O
is O
the O
Pioneers O
. O

The O
Pioneers O
was O
an O
organization N
started O
at O
the O
end N
of O
the O
19th O
century N
which O
pushed O
and O
supported O
the O
ideal N
of O
temperance N
( O
abstaining O
from O
alcohol N
) O
, O
in O
an O
attempt N
to O
deal O
with O
the O
massive O
issue N
of O
alcoholism N
that O
Ireland O
was O
gripped O
by O
. O

Pioneers O
take O
a O
pledge N
to O
remain O
tee O
- O
total N
and O
at O
the O
hight O
of O
the O
organization N
popularity N
, O
had O
an O
estimated O
two O
million O
members H
even O
filling O
Croke O
Park N
on O
the O
25th O
anniversary N
. O

I H
my H
self O
am O
one N
but O
appreciate O
that O
the O
organization N
is O
unlikely O
to O
make O
into O
the O
22nd O
century N
. O

The O
Orange O
Order N
and O
the O
12th O
of O
July O
Marches O
would O
be O
argued O
by O
some O
not O
to O
be O
an O
Irish O
custom O
but O
unarguable O
ticks O
every O
criteria N
to O
be O
considered O
one N
. O

The O
marches N
on O
the O
12th O
of O
July O
are O
only O
really O
attended O
by O
protestants O
in O
the O
Ulster O
but O
in O
spite N
of O
the O
are O
the O
largest O
attended O
paraded O
in O
Ireland O
. O

Barn N

Do O
animals A
see O
images N
on O
a O
TV N
screen N
like O
humans A
do O
? O

I'm O
I H
'm O
unsure O
of O
this O
, O
because O
once O
I H
watched O
a O
commercial O
of O
cat A
food N
with O
my H
cat A
and O
she O
didn't O
did O
n't O
react O
to O
seeing O
another O
cat A
on O
TV N
. O

I H
heard O
that O
a O
company N
( O
here O
is O
a O
link N
: O
http://news.yahoo.com/nestl-purina-releases-commercial-aimed-dogs-183443091.html O
) O
is O
trying O
to O
make O
a O
dog A
food N
commercial O
aimed O
at O
dogs A
, O
complete O
with O
squeaky O
chew O
- O
toy N
sounds N
, O
and O
high O
pitched O
sounds N
that O
humans A
can't O
ca O
n't O
hear O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I H
understand O
, O
this O
ad O
will O
get O
dogs A
excited O
, O
but O
my H
question N
is O
: O
Can O
dogs A
actually O
see O
the O
images N
featured O
in O
the O
advert N
like O
humans A
? O

Also O
, O
can O
animals A
remember O
images N
on O
TV N
like O
us H
, O
humans A
? O

If O
so O
, O
then O
does O
that O
mean O
that O
if O
you H
watched O
a O
scary O
movie N
and O
your H
dog A
/ O
cat A
/ O
parrot A
was O
in O
the O
same O
room N
as O
you H
they O
will O
also O
get O
scared O
? O

I H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
know O
-- O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
particularly O
like O
scary O
movies N
, O
and O
I H
haven't O
have O
n't O
tried O
this O
with O
my H
pet A
. O

Although O
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
scary O
movies N
will O
affect O
pets A
for O
a O
long O
time N
; O
I H
am O
sure O
they'll O
they O
'll O
forget O
sometime O
-- O
or O
am O
I H
wrong O
? O

So O
what O
about O
T.V. N
? O

Do O
dogs A
enjoy O
watching O
T.V. N
? O

Well O
, O
T.V. N
is O
a O
series N
of O
flickering O
pictures N
that O
are O
streamed O
together O
to O
make O
a O
moving O
picture N
. O

The O
pictures N
are O
broadcast O
at O
a O
rate N
of O
about O
60 O
Hz N
, O
which O
is O
how O
fast O
they O
need O
to O
move O
for O
us H
to O
see O
them O
as O
a O
moving O
, O
flawless O
picture N
. O

To O
a O
dog A
, O
watching O
T.V. N
is O
a O
lot N
like O
watching O
and O
old O
scratchy O
silent O
film N
because O
their O
flicker O
fusion N
seems O
to O
occur O
at O
a O
rate N
of O
70 O
to O
80 O
Hz N
. O

So O
they O
see O
the O
pictures N
flicker O
slower O
and O
there O
for O
it O
seems O
choppy O
to O
them O
. O

So O
chances N
are O
that O
if O
your H
dog A
likes O
to O
watch O
T.V. N
, O
it’s O
it O
’s H
probably O
because O
of O
the O
sounds N
. O

Hearing O
is O
a O
dog’s O
dog A
’s H
secondary O
sense N
, O
and O
I H
will O
discuss O
that O
in O
another O
blog N
entery O
. O

Yes O
they O
do O
. O

im O
i H
m O
pretty O
sure O
that O
they O
do O
see O
things N
on O
the O
tv N
screen N
because O
my H
cat A
chases O
things N
around O
the O
tv N
screen N

How O
much O
should O
I H
be O
looking O
at O
for O
horse A
transportation N
? O

I H
need O
one N
horse A
transported O
to O
shows N
throughout O
the O
2012 O
show O
season N
, O
and O
the O
location N
is O
about O
3 O
hours N
away O
from O
where O
I H
live O
. O

The O
place N
where O
I'm O
I H
'm O
boarding O
is O
not O
likely O
to O
want O
to O
take O
me H
this O
far O
, O
and O
I H
do O
not O
have O
any O
ways N
of O
hauling O
him O
myself H
. O

So O
I H
want O
to O
hire O
someone H
( O
or O
multiple O
people N
) O
to O
transport N
me H
to O
these O
shows N
. O

If O
they O
ask O
how O
much O
I'm O
I H
'm O
willing O
to O
pay O
, O
what O
is O
a O
good O
price N
range N
? O

I H
saw O
a O
site N
that O
charges N
$ O
0.70 O
per O
mile N
. O

Is O
that O
reasonable O
? O

Impossible O
to O
say O
, O
but O
I H
guess O
you H
would O
have O
to O
work N
out H
fuel N
consumption N
for O
the O
particular O
vehicle N
that O
they O
are O
using O
and O
pay O
a O
proportion N
of O
that O
, O
and O
some O
on O
top N
for O
the O
driver's O
driver H
's H
time N
and O
effort N
, O
unless O
you H
are O
able O
to O
share O
transport N
with O
another O
or O
more O
, O
that O
would O
keep O
the O
costs O
down O
. O

Remember O
that O
you H
get O
what O
you H
pay O
for O
. O

Three O
hours N
isn't O
is O
n't O
far O
, O
but O
you H
are O
doing O
multiple O
shows N
. O

Some O
people N
are O
willing O
to O
take O
your H
horse A
, O
but O
they O
really O
have O
old O
trailers N
that O
are O
not O
the O
safest O
in O
the O
world N
. O

Rusted O
, O
torn O
corners N
in O
the O
stalls O
, O
unhealthy O
air N
, O
straight O
load N
instead O
of O
slant O
load N
can O
all O
make O
travelling O
hard O
, O
if O
not O
downright O
dangerous O
, O
on O
your H
horse A
. O

I H
had O
my H
horse A
transported O
from O
CA O
to O
WA O
and O
he O
came O
on O
this O
big O
, O
open O
stock N
trailer N
. O

He O
was O
dehydrated O
when O
he O
got O
there O
and O
lost O
weight N
. O

Since O
then O
, O
I H
now O
use H
a O
professional O
horse A
hauling O
service N
with O
people N
who O
ride O
with O
my H
horse A
to O
keep O
an O
eye N
on O
him O
, O
stop N
every O
few O
hours N
for O
water N
, O
and O
their O
trailers N
all O
have O
super O
smooth O
suspension N
. O

All O
horses A
I've O
I H
've O
had O
delivered O
to O
me H
since O
then O
are O
happy O
and O
healthy O
when O
they O
arrive O
. O

I H
would O
call O
Bob H
Hubbard H
Transport N
and O
get O
a O
quote N
. O

Even O
though O
you H
may O
not O
want O
to O
use H
them O
, O
it O
will O
give O
you H
some O
idea N
of O
what O
it O
might O
cost O
and O
what O
is O
fair O
. O

See O
link N
below O
. O

Make O
sure O
the O
trailer N
service N
you H
use H
is O
bonded O
/ O
insured O
and O
knows O
something O
about O
first O
aid N
. O

Do O
they O
have O
this O
anywhere O
? O

I H
want O
to O
take O
a O
cruise N
around O
the O
world N
. O

I H
mean O
literally O
around O
the O
world N
if O
possible O
. O

First O
of O
if O
i H
went O
alone O
on O
a O
regular O
cabin N
how O
much O
would O
you H
estimate N
it O
would O
be O
just O
a O
guess O
. O

Second O
is O
there O
any O
way N
to O
sort N
of O
customize O
the O
places N
you H
wanna O
wan O
na O
go O
to O
? O

Like O
you H
can O
pick O
the O
destinations N
? O

But O
if O
not O
just O
say O
no O
but O
i H
hope O
there O
is O
like O
one N
out H
there O
somewhere O

Prices N
listed O
, O
however O
, O
are O
usually O
based O
on O
two O
people N
in O
a O

you H
will O

face N
some O
high O
" O

costs O
in O
addition N

( O
Two O
people N
in O
a O
cabin N
will O
spend O
more O
onboard O
, O
so O

you H
more O

Good O

Various O

the O
major O
cruise N
lines N
, O
typically O
100 O
days N

Travelling O
on O
your H
own O
you H
would O
have O
to O
pay O
double O

sold O
on O
the O
basis N

double O
occupancy N

No O

yes O
there O
are O
multiple O
around O
the O
world N
cruises N
, O
mainly O
offered O
by O
the O
more O
upscale O
lines N

HOWEVER O
: O
you H
will O
pay O
as O
if O
there O
are O
2 O
people N
in O
the O
cabin N
, O
even O
if O
it O
is O
just O
you H

so O
any O
price N
you H
find O
, O
DOUBLE O
IT N
figure O
, O
$ O
40 O
K O
at O
least O
. O

and O
no O
you H
cannot O
can O
not O
customize O
an O
itinerary N
unless O
you H
book O
several O
different O
legs N
of O
a O
cruise N
with O
stops N
in O
between O
on O
shore N
.. O
say O
book O
a O
Panamal O
Canal O
crossing O
, O
then O
fly O
to O
Asia O
and O
pick O
it O
up O
again O
and O
sail O
to O
India O
then O
fly O
to O
Europe O
to O
sail O
the O
Med O
before O
flying O
to O
England O
to O
hit O

Transatlantic O

Was O
the O
San O
Francisco H
Bay N
Area N
mostly O
Caucasian O
back O
in O
the O
early O
1970s N
? O

No O
. O

There O
has O
been O
a O
large O
Asian O
presence N
in O
the O
SF O
Bay N
Area N
for O
a O
long O
time N
-- O
the O
Chinatown O
here O
was O
the O
largest O
population N
of O
chinese O
outside O
of O
China O
, O
there O
were O
lots N
of O
Japanese O
who'd O
who O
'd O
been O
displaced O
during O
WWII O
. O

The O
whole O
Western O
Addition O
and O
a O
large O
portion N
of O
the O
Haight O
was O
black O
. O

The O
Mission O
was O
basically O
latin O
- O
american O
. O

As O
the O
southeast O
asians O
and O
philipinos O
came O
over O
, O
they O
added O
to O
the O
cultures N
. O

So O
, O
the O
Bay N
Area N
has O
been O
fairly O
mixed O
ethnically O
for O
a O
long O
time N
-- O
caucasians O
may O
have O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
large O
populous O
but O
that's O
that O
's H
because O
most O
tourists H
back O
then O
were O
caucasian O
and O
many O
of O
the O
hippies H
were O
caucasians O
so O
that's O
that O
's H
who O
the O
photographers H
took O
pictures N
of O
. O

The O
other O
ethicities O
weren't O
were O
n't O
well O
represented O
in O
politics N
yet O
-- O
or O
rather O
, O
they O
were O
just O
breaking O
the O
color N
barrier N
in O
the O
70's N
due O
largely O
to O
the O
more O
open O
- O
minded O
hippy H
generation N
. O

Marin O
County O
was O
predominantly O
caucasian O
and O
many O
of O
the O
expanding O
outer O
east O
bay N
areas N
started O
out H
as O
white O
suburbs N
. O

It O
was O
not O
so O
long O
after O
Civil O
Rights N
laws N
against O
discrimination N
started O
to O
have O
an O
impact N
. O

You H
never O
saw O
black O
MUNI O
drivers N
, O
Asian O
police N
, O
Latino O
politicians H
until O
then O
. O

It O
was O
an O
evolution N
. O

Many O
illegals O
were O
not O
counted O
in O
the O
population N
until O
the O
mid-80s O
. O

We H
did O
not O
have O
big O
percent N
of O
Chinese O
migration N
until O
the O
mid O
90s N
. O

We H
had O
fewer O
people N
running O
across O
the O
Mexican O
border N
then O
. O

We H
had O
fewer O
social O
benefits N
at O
that O
time N
for O
people N
so O
many O
immigrants H
were O
not O
counted O
. O

Only O
Caucasians O
had O
any O
political O
power N
, O
corporate O
presence N
or O
owned O
businesses N
except O
for O
Mom H
and O
Pop N
stores N
in O
some O
neighborhoods N
. O

San O
Francisco H
was O
settled O
in O
the O
19th O
and O
20th O
century N
by O
mainly O
European O
immigrants H
except O
for O
some O
Asian O
workers H
who O
were O
manual N
laborers H
. O

There O
has O
always O
been O
a O
Mexican O
- O
American O
cultural O
influence N
since O
Calif O
was O
owned O
by O
Mexico O
. O

We H
had O
a O
larger O
black O
population N
in O
the O
70s N
than O
we H
have O
now O
but O
they O
did O
not O
have O
any O
power N
until O
Willie H
Brown H
was O
elected O
. O

San O
Francisco H
was O
always O
progressive O
and O
welcoming O
and O
tolerant O
to O
all O
kinds N
of O
people N
historically O
. O

The O
counties N
outside O
San O
Francisco H
were O
more O
white O
than O
San O
Francisco H
in O
the O
70s N
. O

EDIT O
: O
My H
memory N
may O
not O
be O
good O
so O
you H
might O
get O
a O
more O
accurate O
answer N
from O
someone H
else O
who O
remembers O
the O
time N
. O

Can O
rabbits A
and O
chickens N
live O
together O
? O

I H
am O
thinking O
about O
getting O
a O
rabbit A
as O
a O
pet A
, O
but O
my H
parents H
said O
that O
it O
has O
to O
stay O
outside O
. O

We H
also O
own O
two O
chickens N
that O
are O
kept O
in O
a O
run O
behind O
out H
garage N
/ O
barn N
thing N
. O

There O
is O
already O
a O
little O
dog A
house N
that O
I H
would O
turn O
into O
a O
little O
rabbit A
hutch N
being O
kept O
back O
there O
and O
I H
was O
thinking O
about O
keeping N
the O
rabbit A
in O
the O
run O
with O
the O
chickens N
, O
but O
keeping N
the O
chickens N
in O
the O
coop N
and O
the O
rabbit A
in O
the O
hutch N
at O
night N
. O

However O
, O
in O
the O
day N
time N
would O
it O
be O
okay O
for O
the O
rabbit A
to O
hop O
around O
along O
with O
the O
chickens N
? O

We H
feed O
the O
chickens N
scraps N
of O
veggies O
and O
fruits N
throughout O
the O
day N
, O
but O
it's O
it O
's H
nothing N
that O
a O
rabbit A
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
digest O
just O
fine O
. O

So O
, O
can O
rabbits A
and O
chickens N
live O
together O
as O
long O
as O
they O
have O
separate O
places N
for O
their O
food N
and O
water N
? O

( O
The O
rabbit A
hutch N
would O
have O
an O
opening N
only O
big O
enough O
for O
the O
rabbit A
, O
the O
chickens N
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
get O
to O
the O
rabbit A
food N
) O
Also O
, O
is O
it O
okay O
if O
the O
rabbit A
occasionally O
sneaks O
a O
few O
bites O
of O
chicken N
feed O
? O

My H
last O
rabbit A
did O
that O
a O
few O
times N
, O
and O
he O
was O
fine O
... O

I H
just O
wanna O
wan O
na O
make O
sure O
:) O
Thank O
! O

Yes O
, O
but O
be O
sure O
that O
your H
chickens N
are O
all O
hens A
( O
I H
mean O
not O
roosters A
) O
, O
Roosters A
may O
attack N
rabbits A
or O
anything O
they O
see O
moving O
, O
so O
be O
aware O
of O
that O
, O
hens A
are O
friendly O
with O
almost O
all O
kinds N
of O
pets A
! O

From O
my H
experience N
Hens A
( O
Not O
roosters A
) O
are O
very O
friendly O
with O
duck A
, O
Guinea O
pigs A
, O
kittens A
, O
cows A
, O
Rabbits A
, O
etc O
. O

Be O
sure O
not O
to O
feed O
your H
rabbits A
non-veg O
items N
! O

You H
said O
they O
live O
in O
different O
cages N
and O
they O
are O
free O
in O
day N
, O
so O
no O
problem N
, O
don't O
do O
n't O
put O
both O
of O
them O
in O
one N
cage N
because O
rabbits A
bedding N
is O
different O
than O
that O
of O
hens A
, O
wet O
bedding N
can O
cause N
diseases N
in O
them O
! O

So O
, O
don't O
do O
n't O
put O
both O
of O
them O
in O
one N
cage N
. O

Good O
luck N
! O

yea O
i H
guess O
but O
rabbits A
a O
easily O
escape O
a O
pen N
or O
another O
rabbit A
could O
get O
in O
there O
and O
that O
rabbit A
could O
be O
the O
opposite N
gender N
. O

So O
be O
very O
careful O
and O
some O
feeds O
could O
be O
toxic O
to O
rabbits A
and O
safe O
for O
chickens N
. O

Rabbits A
do O
burrow O
also O
so O
don't O
do O
n't O
be O
surprised O
if O
chicken N
are O
falling O
into O
holes N
. O

rabbits A
are O
delicate O
and O
can O
get O
diseases N
so O
watch O
out H
for O
that O
. O

melting N
brass N
did O
not O
work N
? O

my H
friends H
and O
I H
are O
trying O
to O
melt O
bras N
to O
make O
some O
little O
figures N
. O

we H
have O
made O
a O
furnace N
as O
such O
, O
we H
took O
a O
clay O
flower A
pot N
with O
a O
hole N
in O
the O
bottom N
put O
a O
piece N
of O
steel N
pipe N
in O
the O
middle O
of O
it O
with O
a O
cap N
on O
the O
bottom N
, O
filled O
the O
pipe N
with O
brass N
scrap N
, O
surounded O
the O
pipe N
with O
charcoal O
lit O
it O
off O
and O
pumped O
air N
through O
the O
hole N
in O
the O
pot N
, O
everything O
got O
red O
hot O
but O
did O
not O
melt O
. O

what O
am O
I H
doing O
wrong O

I H
would O
recommend O
to O
start O
with O
something O
more O
simple O
like O
tin N
, O
pewter O
, O
aluminum N
or O
zinc N
, O
they O
all O
have O
a O
much O
more O
reasonable O
melting N
point N
. O

I'll O
I H
'll O
just O
echo O
both O
other O
answers N
. O

Molten O
brass N
is O
damn O
hot O
and O
usually O
it's O
it O
's H
pressurized O
gas N
and O
forced O
air N
or O
oxygen N
. O

Even O
if O
you H
did O
melt O
it O
, O
I H
doubt O
you H
foresaw O
the O
issues N
of O
handling N
it O
and O
pouring O
it O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
really O
too O
advanced O
for O
a O
beginner H
, O
both O
in O
tooling O
and O
safety N
. O

Just O
the O
zinc N
fumes N
will O
get O
you H
, O
if O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
take O
precautions N
. O

Pewter N
is O
perfect O
for O
what O
you H
are O
doing O
, O
and O
it O
melts O
on O
a O
stove N
top N
. O

I H
would O
recommend O
to O
start O
with O
something O
more O
simple O
like O
tin N
, O
pewter O
, O
aluminum N
or O
zinc N
, O
they O
all O
have O
a O
much O
more O
reasonable O
melting N
point N
. O

Brass N
has O
an O
even O
higher O
melting N
point N
than O
bronze N
and O
I H
would O
think O
your H
charcoal O
just O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
get O
hot O
enough O
. O

I H
bet N
you H
also O
did O
take O
charcoal O
as O
it O
is O
used O
for O
barbecue N
which O
does O
not O
get O
as O

Should O
all O
UK O
towns N
and O
their O
cafes N
or O
restaurants N
provide O
Halal O
food N
? O

Some O
friends H
of O
mine H
visited O
Dartmouth O
in O
Devon O
whilst O
on O
holiday N
last O
summer N
. O

They O
could O
not O
find O
any O
cafes N
or O
food N
shops N
that O
provided O
Halal O
prepared O
foods N
. O

Its O
It O
s H
important O
to O
their O
religion N
that O
they O
only O
consume O
Halal O
food N
. O

Even O
if O
you H
buy O
a O
cake N
in O
a O
bakers H
baker H
s H
you H
can O
not O
be O
too O
what O
happens O
in O
the O
kitchen N
, O
for O
example N
the O
cake N
may O
have O
been O
sliced O
using O
a O
knife N
used O
for O
preparing O
ham O
. O

Its O
It O
s H
simply O
not O
just O
a O
case N
of O
avoiding O
pork N
, O
alcohol N
and O
only O
being O
allowed O
to O
eat O
halal O
prepared O
meat N
, O
but O
the O
kitchen N
and O
its O
utensils N
should O
not O
have O
been O
used O
for O
prohibited O
foods N
. O

Places O
like O
Dartmouth O
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
tourist H
towns N
and O
should O
provide O
foods N
for O
people N
of O
all O
religions N
. O

We H
all O
enjoy O
buying O
a O
snack N
when O
visiting O
a O
town N
or O
attraction N
while O
on O
holiday N
. O

Not O
everyone O
wants O
to O
bring O
packed O
lunch N
. O

Its O
It O
s H
not O
fair O
if O
some O
people N
have O
to O
go O
without O
buying O
food N
because O
no O
place N
will O
provide O
suitable O
food N
for O
them O
. O

I H
think O
its O
it O
s H
only O
fair O
that O
nowadays O
every O
town N
should O
provide O
at O
least O
one N
halal O
cafe N
or O
restaurant N
and O
hopefully O
one N
day N
every O
British O
catering N
establishment N
will O
be O
halal O
. O

When O
I H
went O
to O
Bosnia O
, O
all O
the O
meat N
was O
Halal O
. O

I H
will O
not O
eat O
halal O
meat N
, O
so O
guess O
what O
, O
I H
opted O
for O
foods N
which O
weren't O
were O
n't O
a O
meat N
dish N
, O
there O
were O
plenty O
of O
other O
options N
. O

I H
could O
not O
go O
to O
their O
country N
and O
demand N
they O
slaughter O
and O
sell O
an O
animal A
as O
meat N
the O
way N
I H
prefer O
to O
eat O
it O
. O

When O
you H
go O
to O
another O
country N
, O
you H
live O
by O
their O
way N
of O
life N
and O
their O
laws N
, O
if O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
you H
know O
how O
to O
get O
back O
out H
the O
country N
( O
but O
I H
guess O
our H
benefits N
system N
is O
too O
much O
to O
throw O
away O
, O
huh O
) O
. O

Cafes N
and O
restaurants N
rarely O
use H
the O
same O
cutlery N
for O
different O
food N
groups N
anyway O
, O
they O
normally O
have O
blue O
for O
bakery N
items N
, O
have O
red O
for O
cooked O
meat N
, O
have O
brown O
for O
raw O
meat N
, O
etc O
- O
all O
for O
food N
preparation N
and O
hygiene N
policies N
. O

No O
. O

To O
prevent O
animal A
cruelty N
, O
many O
countries N
forbid O
Halal O
and O
Kosher O
meat N
. O

Switzerland O
is O
one N
, O
and O
the O
Netherlands O
are O
passing O
the O
same O
law N
. O

It O
will O
become O
EU O
law N
in O
a O
couple N
of O
years N
. O

We H
can't O
ca O
n't O
dictate O
what O
business N
wants O
to O
open O
where O
. O

If O
someone H
thinks O
there O
is O
a O
business N
opportunity N
then O
they O
will O
start O
opening N

only O
places N

How O
to O
convince O
my H
parents H
to O
let O
me H
get O
a O
Ball O
python A
? O

They O
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
ANYTHING O
about O
Ball O
pythons A
. O

When O
I H
ask O
my H
mom H
she O
says O
she O
will O
never O
let O
a O
snake A
in O
her O
house N
. O

She O
has O
no O
experience N
with O
snakes A
and O
has O
never O
held O
one N
. O

I H
did O
all O
my H
research N
and O
am O
well O
prepared O
to O
keep O
one N
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
14 O
by O
the O
way N

Lay H
some O
knowledge N
on O
them O
dude H
. O

Maybe O
if O
they O
see O
how O
much O
time N
and O
effort N
you've O
you H
've O
devoted O
to O
researching O
the O
animal A
they'll O
they O
'll O
reconsider O
. O

Tell O
them O
it O
costs O
like O
8 O
dollars N
a O
month N
( O
if O
even O
that O
much O
) O
to O
keep O
it O
fed O
. O

Be O
helpful O
around O
the O
house N
to O
show O
that O
even O
if O
you H
can't O
ca O
n't O
pay O
for O
it O
yourself H
that O
youre O
you H
re O
willing O
to O
work N
for O
it O
. O

Once O
you've O
you H
've O
buttered O
them O
up O
a O
bit N
try O
to O
get O
them O
to O
the O
pet A
store N
and O
ask O
one N
of O
the O
employees H
to O
handle N
the O
snake A
showing O
your H
mom H
how O
gentle O
and O
harmless O
they O
can O
be O
. O

Maybe O
even O
try O
to O
get O
your H
mom H
to O
hold O
it O
a O
bit N
. O

My H
wife H
was O
TERRIFIED O
of O
snakes A
when O
we H
first O
met O
, O
I H
introduced O
her O
to O
one N
out H
my H
baby H
corn N
snakes A
and O
she O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
it O
. O

Be O
persistent O
, O
but O
don't O
do O
n't O
pester O
them O
about O
it O
cause N
that'll O
that O
'll O
get O
you H
nowhere O
fast O
. O

Good O
luck N

My H
general O
convince O
your H
parents H
to O
let O
you H
get O
a O
reptile A
advice N
: O

1 O
. O
Be O
responsible O
. O

Do O
all O
your H
chores N
without O
being O
nagged O
, O
take O
care N
of O
any O
existing O
pets A
, O
keep O
your H
room N
clean O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

Prove O
, O
to O
your H
parents' O
parents H
' O
satisfaction N
, O
that O
you H
, O
not O
they O
, O
will O
be O
the O
one N
actually O
taking O
care N
of O
your H
new O
pet A
. O

2 O
. O
Save O
up O
, O
and O
research N
, O
so O
that O
you H
are O
ready O
for O
your H
new O
pet A
. O

3 O
. O
Bargain O
with O
them O
. O

Offer O
to O
do O
extra O
chores N
, O
ask O
for O
your H
pet A
as O
a O
reward O
for O
good O
grades N
, O
something O
like O
that O
. O

4 O
. O
Play O
the O
sympathy N
card N
. O

If O
you H
can O
find O
a O
pet A
at O
a O
shelter N
, O
or O
that O
a O
friend H
needs N
to O
get O
rid O
of O
because O
they're O
they O
're O
moving O
or O
whatever O
, O
you H
might O
be O
able O
to O
talk O
your H
parents H
into O
" O
giving O
it O
a O
good O
home N
" O
where O
you H
might O
not O
be O
able O
to O
talk O
them O
into O
buying O
a O
new O
pet A
. O

On O
the O
fear N
angle N
-- O
talk O
her O
into O
coming O
to O
the O
pet A
store N
with O
you H
. O

Once O
you're O
you H
're O
there O
, O
ask O
if O
you H
can O
hold O
a O
ball N
python A
. O

Once O
you're O
you H
're O
holding O
it O
, O
try O
to O
get O
her O
to O
touch O
/ O
pet A
it O

My H
Snake's O
Snake A
's H
meal N
is O
TOO O
big O
, O
what O
can O
I H
do O
? O

Just O
today N
I H
bought O
a O
medium N
rat A
for O
my H
beloved O
Ball O
Python A
Salazar O
( O
name N
after O
Harry H
Potter H
) O
. O

Last O
time N
I H
got O
a O
medium N
rat A
it O
was O
a O
girl H
and O
my H
snake A
handled O
her O
easily O
. O

But O
today N
, O
I H
got O
a O
boy H
and O
realized O
that O
he O
is O
HUGE O
! O

I H
really O
do O
love O
my H
snake A
cause N
she O
is O
actually O
an O
affectionate O
cold O
- O
blooded O
creature A
. O

So O
my H
true O
question N
comes O
to O
this O
, O
how O
can O
I H
knock O
the O
rat A
out H
? O

If O
I H
threw O
him O
against O
a O
wall N
and O
still O
conscious O
he O
will O
run O
away O
, O
do O
I H
hang O
him O
by O
the O
tail N
so O
the O
blood N
can O
flush O
into O
his O
skull N
? O

I H
really O
do O
need O
answers N
and O
advice N
, O
and O
NOT O
INSULTING O
ANSWERS N
!! O

LIKE O
SERIOUSLY O
!! O
>:( O

Best O
answer N
shall O
receive O
points O
:) O

iw H
ould O
just O
stick N
him O
in O
the O
tank N
and O
let O
your H
snake A
have O
a O
nice O
hunt N
for O
once O
, O
snakes A
jaws N
detach O
for O
this O
sort N
of O
this O
thing N
, O
so O
why O
not O
give O
her O
a O
good O
hunt N
, O
but O
if O
you H
do O
want O
him O
knock O
him O
id O
i H
d O
just O
throw O
him O
against O
the O
wall N
or O
something O
,, O
lol O
i H
dont O
do O
nt O
know O
, O
i H
agree O
with O
you H
though O
throw O
him O
, O
haha O

Ok O
so O
if O
youre H
snake A
will O
take O
pre-killed O
, O
you H
can O
" O
gas N
it O
" O
. O

Just O
put O
the O
rat A
in O
a O
sealed O
tupperwear O
container N
with O
no O
airholes O
and O
wait N
until O
it O
passes O
out H
and O
dies O
and O
then O
feed O
it O
. O

If O
it O
won't O
wo O
n't O
take O
pre-killed O
and O
you H
usually O
feed O
live O
then O
you H
could O
hold O
the O
rat A
by O
the O
tail N
and O
whack O
it O
against O
a O
hard O
surface N
, O
like O
a O
refrigerator N
or O
wall N
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
like O
that O
option N
though O
- O
I H
think O
it's O
it O
's H
pretty O
cruel O
and O
I'd O
not O
done O
properly O
you'll O
you H
'll O
end N
up O
really O
hurting O
the O
rat A
but O
not O
stunning O
him O
enough O
to O
stop N
possible O
injury N
to O
your H
snake A
. O

I H
would O
do O
the O
tupperwear O
idea N
TBH O
- O
easiest O
and O
most O
humane O
. O

You H
could O
also O
just O
wait N
until O
the O
rat A
passes O
out H
for O
about O
1 O
minute O
and O
them O
feed O
it O
- O
at O
this O
point N
, O
it O
could O
still O
have O
a O
bit N
of O
a O
heart N
beat O
and O
be O
slightly O
still O
alive O
. O

And O
also O
maybe O
try O
holding O
the O
rat A
in O
feeding O
prongs N
so O
your H
snake A
can O
get O
a O
good O
hold O
and O
grip N
on O
his O
prey A
. O

Good O
luck N
! O

Just O
my H
opinion N
here O
- O
no O
judgement N
- O
getting O
your H
snake A
on O
frozen O
/ O
thawed O
will O
prove O
to O
be O
much O
easier O
for O
you H
and O
safer O
for O
your H
snake A
in O
the O
long O
run O
. O

My H
opinion N
- O
take O
it O
for O
what O
it's O
it O
's H
worth N
… O

Looking O
to O
move O
to O
Toronto O
? O

I H
am O
a O
20 O
something O
gay O
black O
male O
and O
I H
am O
looking O
for O
suggestions N
on O
neighborhoods N
close O
to O
the O
downtown N
Toronto O
area N
. O

Im O
I H
m O
moving O
from O
South O
Carolina O
so O
this O
will O
already O
be O
a O
huge O
culture N

Any O
suggestions N
? O

Being O
gay O
and O
living O
in O
Toronto O
is O
just O
fine O
. O

You H
may O
consider O
the O
Gay O
Village O
on O
Church N
Street N

right O
downtown N

It O
is O
full O
of O
gay O

everything O

But O
, O
you H
could O
live O
where O
ever O
you H

you H

For O

reasons N

knowing O
how O
extremely O
difficult O
it O
is O
to O
drive O
a O

in O
the O
city N
, O
you H
should O
probably O
try O
to O
be O
near O
the O
subway N
system N
. O

But O
, O
can O
you H
immigrate O
? O

Being O
an O
American O

How O
to O
train N
my H
puppy A
? O

I H
have O
a O
4 O
months N
Shih O
Tzu O
puppy A
. O

Recently O
I'm O
I H
'm O
having O
trouble N
training N
him O
. O

He O
is O
kind N
of O
hate O
walking O
with O
leash N
, O
every O
time N
I H
put O
the O
leash N
on O
, O
he O
will O
try O
to O
bite N
it O
. O

And O
he O
is O
not O
following O
me H
when O
I H
was O
walking O
. O

I H
saw O
lots N
of O
videos N
about O
this O
, O
but O
actually O
it O
didn't O
did O
n't O
help O
. O

Is O
there O
any O
way N
can O
let O
him O
know O
how O
to O
walk O
with O
leash N
? O

And O
every O
time N
he O
see O
some O
one N
he O
will O
rush N
to O
people N
and O
jump N
on O
them O
, O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
listen O
to O
me H
. O

He O
is O
really O
excited O
about O
anybody O
he O
see O
. O

How O
to O
prevent O
this O
? O

Last O
thing N
is O
every O
time N
I H
sit O
on O
a O
chair N
or O
something O
higher O
than O
him O
, O
he O
will O
try O
to O
jump N
on O
, O
if O
he O
can't O
ca O
n't O
, O
he O
will O
bark N
all O
the O
time N
until O
I H
let O
him O
get O
on O
, O
what O
should O
I H
do O
with O
this O
? O

Anyone O
have O
any O
suggestion N
? O

thank O
you H
very O
much O
. O

Hi O
, O
I H
am O
a O
dog A
trainer H
for O
25 O
yrs N
. O

You H
need O
to O
purchase N
what O
is O
called O
a O
shoulder N
point N
harness N
. O

This O
type N
of O
harness N
goes O
around O
the O
dogs A
dog A
s H
chest N
and O
legs N
and O
has O
a O
clip N
for O
the O
leash N
up O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
dog A
in O
middle O
of O
shoulder N
blades N
. O

This O
way N
, O
he O
cannot O
can O
not O
reach O
the O
leash N
to O
chew O
it O
. O

When O
he O
swivels O
his O
head N
to O
go O
for O
it O
anyway O
, O
tell O
him O
sharp O
" O
UH O
UH O
" O
gently O
correct O
him O
with O
a O
small O
tug N
and O
continue O
your H
walk O
. O

Do O
this O
repeatedly O
and O
frequently O
and O
he O
will O
learn O
to O
walk O
on O
a O
leash N
. O

Patience N
is O
the O
key N
here O
. O

He O
is O
a O
young O
pup A
and O
will O
learn O
over O
time N
and O
consistency N
in O
his O
training N
. O

And O
always O
, O
always O
train N
with O
love O
and O
positive N
methods N
- O
never O
hit O
or O
harshly O
scold O
. O

Never O
train N
out H
of O
fear N
. O

You H
want O
your H
dog A
to O
admire O
you H
as O
his O
pack O
leader H
, O
not O
fear N
you H
. O

Good O
luck N
with O
your H
puppy A
! O

All O
the O
best O
. O

Put O
him O
in O
dog A
obedience N
school N
or O
call O
a O
professional O
dog A
trainer H
. O
:) O

why O
dont O
do O
nt O
you H
get O
some O
treats O
that O
he O
loves O
and O
only O
give O
him O
them O
when O
he O
does O
something O
right O
. O

or O
, O
as O
i H
saw O
on O
embarrassing O
pets A
on O
tv N
, O
get O
a O
clicker O
type N
thing N
and O
treats O
as O
well O
. O

try O
to O
train N
him O
to O
heel N
, O
which O
means N
to O
walk O
round O
you H
before O
he O
needs N
to O
go O
on O
a O
leash N
, O
and O
he O
may O
do O
that O
. O

or O
you H
could O
even O
spray N
some O
scented O
spray N
on O
the O
leash N
and O
he O
will O
go O
for O
the O
scent N
and O
probably O
, O
if O
you H
act N
quick O
enough O
, O
will O
stay O
on O
the O
leash N
. O

What O
sort N
of O
Hotel O
could O
I H
expect O
to O
find O
in O
New H
Delhi O
/ O
Agra O
/ O
Varanasi O
for O
rs O
500 O
per O
night N
? O

Hey O
guys H
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
looking O
to O
visit O
India O
with O
some O
mates O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
February O
next O
year N
and O
I H
am O
wandering O
what O
standard O
of O
accommodation N
we H
could O
get O
for O
Rs O
500 O
per O
person H
per O
night N
. O

There O
would O
be O
four O
of O
us H
so O
we H
would O
probably O
be O
looking O
at O
2 O
twin H
rooms N
for O
Rs O
1000 O
, O
close O
to O
the O
centre N
of O
these O
cities N
. O

This O
would O
be O
on O
a O
walk O
- O
in O
basis N
as O
we H
want O
to O
have O
the O
freedom N
of O
finding O
a O
place N
that O
looks O
good O
( O
Not O
relying O
on O
pictures N
from O
the O
internet N
) O
and O
is O
in O
a O
spot N
we H
like O
. O

Thanks N
in O
advance N
for O
sharing N
your H
experience N
! O

Sorry O
, O
almost O
forgot O
to O
ask O
- O
Would O
it O
be O
cheaper O
to O
walk O
- O
in O
to O
these O
hotels N
rather O
than O
pre O
book O
? O

In O
Delhi O
I'd O
I H
'd O
recommend O
Ajay O
Guesthouse O
. O

Travelled O
to O
Delhi O
twice O
and O
stayed O
there O
twice O
. O

Rooms N
start O
from O
500 O
per O
double O
. O

Those O
ones N
are O
quite O
small O
. O

Must O
say O
, O
in O
Delhi O
it's O
it O
's H
hard O
to O
get O
good O
price N
/ O
quality N
rating O
. O

I H
have O
found O
this O
hotel N
in O
the O
Lonely O
Planet O
guide N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
in O
an O
area N
starting O
with O
a O
P H
, O
many O
tourist H
hotels N
there O
and O
the O
location N
is O
very O
nice O
. O

But O
in O
general O
, O
Delhi O
is O
the O
hardest O
place N
to O
find O
a O
nice O
clean O
hotel N
for O
that O
price N
. O

In O
Varanasi O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I've O
I H
've O
stayed O
in O
a O
more O
expensive O
hotel N
there O
, O
but O
you H
can O
check O
some O
travelguides O
or O
tripadvisor O
? O

Also O
, O
while O
travelling O
ask O
people N
where O
they've O
they O
've O
been O
and O
if O
they O
have O
any O
hotel N
recommendations N
. O

In O
Agra O
I've O
I H
've O
stayed O
in O
a O
place N
fellow H
travellers H
recommended O
, O
they O
found O
it O
in O
the O
Rough O
Guide O
. O

It O
was O
nice O
and O
close O
to O
the O
Taj O
. O

It O
was O
quite O
easy O
to O
find O
something O
. O

( O
Dont O
Do O
nt O
stay O
in O
Agra O
too O
long O
. O

One O
night N
is O
enough O
! O
) O

There O
were O
many O
hotels N
there O
. O

Ive O
I H
ve O
paid O
500 O
for O
a O
double O
room N
there O
and O
it O
was O
fine O
and O
clean O

To O
Stay O
in O
delhi O
- O
Hotel O
Aster O
Inn N
is O
best O
to O
stay O
in O
delhi O
. O

it O
is O
in O
karol O
bagh O
. O

some O
beautiful O
locations N
like O
close O
to O
Karol O
Bagh O
Shopping O
Market N
, O
Presidential O
Palace N
, O
and O
Birla O
Mandir O
Temple O
and O
Connaught O
Place N
and O
Jantar O
Mantar O
are O
near O
to O
it O
. O

TO O
Stay O
in O
Agra O
- O
Hotel O
Atithi O
and O
Aditya O
Palace N
is O
perfect O
for O
you H
. O

it O
is O
centrally O
situated O
. O

To O
Stay O
in O
Varanasi O
- O
Sandeep O
Hotel O
is O
you H
choice N
... O

which O
one N
out H
of O
these O
makes O
the O
best O
pet A
? O

a O
degu O
, O
a O
rat A
, O
a O
mouse A
, O
a O
hamster A
or O
a O
guinea N
pig A
? O

and O
why O
is O
the O
one N
a O
better O
pet A
? O

Get O
a O
guinea N
pig A
. O

I H
have O
a O
hamster A
, O
and O
mice A
and O
rats A
like O
to O
escape O
. O

The O
Guinea O
pig A
is O
better O
because O
its O
it O
s H
a O
lot N
larger O
than O
a O
hamster A
, O
rat A
, O
mouse A
, O
or O
degu O
. O

So O
if O
you H
lose O
him O
, O
he O
is O
easier O
to O
find O
, O
because O
smaller O
rodents A
just O
LOVE O
to O
escape O
from O
their O
cages N
. O

So O
my H
opinion N
is O
Guinea O
pigs A
. O

( O
plus O
they O
dont O
do O
nt O
stink N
that O
bad O
) O

Depends O
on O
what O
you H
want O
in O
a O
pet A
, O
to O
be O
honest O
. O

Also O
depends O
on O
the O
space N
you H
have O
, O
how O
much O
time N
you H
can O
handle N
the O
pet A
, O
how O
much O
money N
you H
can O
spend O
, O
etc O
. O

I've O
I H
've O
had O
experience N
with O
all O
of O
those O
pets A
except O
Degus O
. O

My H
favorite O
would O
have O
to O
be O
the O
rat A
. O

They're O
They O
're O
incredibly O
social O
, O
highly O
trainable O
, O
and O
very O
clean O
. O

Mine H
learned O
to O
" O
go O
to O
the O
bathroom N
" O
only O
in O
their O
cages N
and O
loved O
to O
ride O
on O
my H
shoulder N
or O
hang O
out H
in O
my H
hoodie O
pouch N
. O

The O
only O
downside N
is O
they O
should O
be O
kept O
in O
pairs N
or O
trios N
and O
require O
a O
pretty O
large O
habitat N
. O

That O
means N
expense N
, O
space N
, O
and O
they O
require O
weekly O
cage N
cleaning N
. O

My H
second N
favorite O
would O
have O
to O
be O
the O
Guinea O
Pig A
- O
not O
quite O
as O
social O
with O
people N
as O
rats A
( O
at O
least O
mine H
wasn't O
was O
n't O
) O
but O
more O
so O
than O
most O
hamsters A
or O
mice A
. O

Again O
, O
pairs N
or O
trios N
and O
pretty O
big O
living O
space N
. O

They O
, O
too O
, O
need O
weekly O
cage N
cleaning N
and O
can O
cost O
quite O
a O
bit N
. O

I H
could O
handle N
my H
mice A
, O
but O
they O
where O
skittish O
and O
preferred O
their O
cage N
. O

I've O
I H
've O
never O
met O
a O
hamster A
that O
didn't O
did O
n't O
bite N
me H
. O

Never O
had O
/ O
handled O
a O
Degu O
. O

Get O
a O
guinea N
pig A
. O

We H
have O
two O
. O

They O
are O
social O
and O
like O
to O
be O
handled O
. O

You H
have O
to O
have O
two O
because O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
do O
well O
alone O
. O

Make O
certain O
you H
get O
two O
females H
. O

Two O
males A
can O
fight N
and O
you H
definitely O
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
babies H
!! O

Guinea O
pigs A
( O
also O
called O
cavies A
) O
are O
gentle O
creatures A
and O
are O
awake O
during O
the O
day N
and O
sleep O
at O
night N
. O

They O
will O
whistle O
when O
they O
hear O
you H
as O
an O
encouragement N
for O
you H
to O
give O
them O
a O
treat O
like O
leaf N
lettuce N
. O

They O
love O
leaf N
or O
romaine N
lettuce N
and O
tomatos N
, O
celery A
, O
cucumbers A
, O
carrots N
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
feed O
them O
broccoli A
, O
cauliflower A
, O
garlic A
, O
onions N
, O
head N
lettuce N
.... O
they O
are O
all O
too O
difficult O
for O
them O
to O
digest O
. O

Also O
they O
can't O
ca O
n't O
eat O
potatos N
, O
they O
are O
toxic O
for O
them O
. O

If O
you H
keep O
the O
cage N
clean O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
smell O
and O
you H
can O
buy O
spray N
on O
cleaser N
for O
them O
, O
just O
massage N
it O
into O
their O
coat N
and O
groom O
them O
. O

Fostering O
6 O
week N
old O
kittens A
and O
HATING O
IT N
! O

Need O
Advice N
!? O

I H
wanted O
to O
volunteer H
and O
help O
animals A
, O
and O
decided O
to O
try O
fostering O
kittens A
. O

This O
is O
my H
first O
experience N
and O
I H
have O
two O
six O
week N
old O
kittens A
right O
now O
and O
am O
at O
my H
wits N
wit N
s H
end N
. O

I H
do O
not O
want O
to O
have O
to O
bring O
them O
back O
before O
they O
are O
eight O
weeks N
old O
but O
they O
are O
ruining O
my H
apartment N
. O

They O
track N
poop N
everywhere O
( O
most O
disgustingly O
my H
bed N
.... O
) O
, O
and O
am O
constantly O
trying O
to O
climb O
up O
everything O
, O
including O
my H
bare O
legs N
! O

My H
legs N
and O
hands N
are O
just O
full O
of O
scratches N
. O

I H
realize O
they O
are O
young O
and O
that O
cats A
do O
climb O
, O
but O
this O
is O
just O
ridiculous O
. O

My H
apartment N
also O
smells O
repulsive O
even O
though O
I H
am O
cleaning N
out H
their O
litter N
box N
at O
least O
once O
a O
day N
if O
not O
twice O
. O

Any O
suggestions N
and O
helpful O
hints N
to O
make O
this O
a O
more O
positive N
experience N
would O
be O
extremely O
appreciated O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
kind N
of O
the O
way N
it O
goes O
.. O
lol O
. O

Limit O
them O
to O
one N
room N
with O
easy O
to O
clean O
flooring N
. O

If O
you H
have O
limited O
options N
, O
try O
the O
bathroom N
. O

Make O
sure O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
litter N
boxes N
that O
are O
cleaned O
often O
. O

Depending O
on O
the O
batch N
of O
kittens A
, O
I H
will O
often O
have O
as O
many O
as O
one N
per O
kitten A
. O

They O
can O
produce O
a O
lot N
of O
waste O
and O
even O
scooping O
twice O
a O
day N
they O
can O
get O
messy O
. O

For O
some O
reason N
it O
takes O
them O
awhile O
to O
learn O
not O
to O
step O
in O
poop N
. O

Also O
if O
they O
have O
diarrhea N
, O
check O
in O
with O
your H
foster O
coordinator H
. O

They O
made O
need O
medication N
or O
deworming O
or O
something O
. O

They O
are O
testing O
out H
their O
claws N
and O
teeth N
. O

To O
some O
degree N
you H
can O
/ O
should O
help O
teach O
them O
not O
to O
use H
their O
teeth N
and O
claws N
inappropriately O
. O

But O
in O
the O
meantime N
, O
highly O
recommend O
jeans N
and O
long O
sleeves N
anytime O
you'll O
you H
'll O
be O
interacting O
with O
the O
kittens A
. O

Then O
take O
care N
of O
yourself H
. O

Get O
plenty O
of O
sleep O
and O
make O
sure O
you H
take O
time N
out H
to O
do O
some O
things N
you H
enjoy O
. O

Try O
visiting O
the O
kittens A
a O
few O
times N
a O
day N
for O
short O
periods N
of O
time N
. O

Try O
to O
go O
in O
there O
with O
the O
right O
frame O
of O
mind N
and O
enjoy O
them O
for O
what O
they O
are O
. O

If O
you H
still O
don't O
do O
n't O
enjoy O
the O
kittens A
, O
see O
what O
other O
opportunities N
are O
available O
. O

They O
may O
need O
foster O
homes N
for O
adult O
cats A
in O
different O
situations N
.. O
sick O
, O
recovering O
from O

I H
find O

much O
easier O

Generally O
they're O
they O
're O
not O
clawing O

they O
don't O
do O
n't O

they O
don't O

n't O

Decide O

not O
your H
thing N

give O

And O
do O
more O
research N

you H

Take O

evidentary O
requirements N

including O
fees N
and O
forms N

It O
depends O
on O
if O
you H
ever O
registered O
the O
birth N
. O

Some O
places N
do O
the O
registration N
right O
at O
the O
hospital N
.... O
in O
some O
smaller O
places N
, O
you H
need O
to O
register N
your H
child's O
child H
's H
birth N
at O
the O
town N
hall N
/ O
registrar's O
registrar H
's H
office N
. O

My H
first O
three O
children H
were O
born O
in O
Southern O
Ontario O
cities N
. O

The O
birth N
registration N
was O
done O
right O
in O
hospital N
. O

My H
last O
son H
, O
was O
born O
in O
Northern O
Ontario O
.... O

I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
know O
that O
I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
register N
him O
in O
the O
ridiculous O
amount N
of O
paperwork N
I H
had O
filled O
out H
in O
the O
hospital N
and O
was O
supposed O
to O
go O
to O
city N
hall N
within O
90 O
days N
. O

Two O
years N
later O
when O
I H
got O
around O
to O
filling O
for O
his O
birth N
certificate N
, O
I H
find O
out H
he O
was O
never O
registered O
. O

I H
had O
to O
call O
the O
Office O
of O
the O
Registrar O
General O
in O
Thunder O
Bay N
, O
have O
copies N
of O
the O
delayed O
registration N
form N
mailed O
out H
to O
me H
, O
as O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
an O
online O
area N
for O
it O
yet O
, O
fill O
those O
out H
, O
send O
them O
away O
, O
then O
apply O
for O
his O
birth N
certificate N
. O

If O
you H
are O
just O
applying O
for O
a O
birth N
certificate N
for O
the O
first O
time N
, O
its O
it O
s H
simple O
to O
do O
it O
over O
the O
computer N
. O

For O
$ O
56 O
you H
can O
even O
have O
it O
expedited O
and O
will O
get O
in O
three O
business N
days N
or O
your H
money N
back O
. O

This O
is O
in O
Ontario O
of O
course N
, O
the O
rates N
may O
be O
slightly O
different O
for O
other O
provinces N
/ O
territories N
. O

You H
just O
need O
basic O
information N
, O
and O
answer N
a O
few O
questions N
like O
what O
hospital N
was O
the O
child H
born O
at O
/ O
who O
was O
the O
doctor H
.... O

None O
, O
just O
walk O
in O
to O
the O
service N
office N
and O
present N
all O
the O
identification N
you H
have O
to O
prove O
your H
identity N
. O

they O
may O
then O
chose O
to O
ask O
you H
to O
bring O
more O
evidence N
, O
or O
just O
look O
up O
the O
record N
and O
hand N
you H
the O
certificate N
. O

You H
can O
probably O
do O
it O
all O
on O
- O
line N
. O

if O
you H
were O

Good O
luck N

My H
parents H
didn't O
did O
n't O
send O
for O
my H
birth N
certificate N
until O
I H
was O
16 O
and O
needed O
it O
for O
summer N
employment N
. O

It O
was O
no O
problem N
to O
get O
PROVIDED O
the O
birth N
was O
registered O
in O
the O
first O
place N
. O

I H
add O
that O
in O
because O
there O
have O
been O
some O
people N
who O
have O
tried O
to O
claim O
citizenship N
by O
sending O
for O
their O
birth N
certificate N
when O
they O
were O
never O
really O
born O
in O
Canada O
or O
to O
Canadian O
parents H
. O

When O
a O
child H
is O
born O
in O
Canada O
the O
birth N
is O
registered O
before O
the O
baby H
can O
leave O
the O
hospital N
. O

As O
long O
as O
that O
was O
done O
you H
can O
send O
for O
it O
at O
any O
time N
. O

Each O
provincial O
government N
has O
a O
website N
that O
lists O
the O
process N
for O
that O
Province O
so O
depending O
upon O
where O
you H
were O
born O
you H
can O
google O
it O

Carnival O
and O
Royal O
Caribbean O
are O
two O
popular O
cruise N
lines N
that O
have O
strong O
followings N
. O

Some O
cruise N
aficionados H
refuse O
to O
sail O
on O
one N
or O
the O
other O
. O

Are O
there O
any O
major O
differences N

them O
? O

Explore O
which O

may O

needs N
the O
best O

For O
our H
comparison N
we H
sailed O
on O
two O
similar O
ships N
- O
the O
Carnival O
Liberty O
and O
the O
Royal O
Caribbean O
Mariner O
of O
the O
Seas O
. O

Itinerary N
Both O
ships N
go O
to O
Caribbean O
Islands N
like O
Jamaica O
, O
Grand O
Cayman O
, O
Cozumel O
, O
St. O
Thomas H
, O
the O
Bahamas O
and O
St. O
Martin H
/ O
St. O
Maarten O
. O

The O
Liberty O
also O
visited O
its O
private O
island N
Half O
Moon O
Cay O
, O
Puerto O
Rico O
, O
and O
Grand O
Turk H
. O

The O
Mariner O
of O
the O
Seas O
traveled O
to O
its O
private O
island N
Coco O
Cay O
and O
Labadee O
( O
the O
north O
coast N
of O
Haiti O
) O
. O

We H
loved O
most O
of O
the O
locations N
that O
both O
of O
the O
ships N
visited O
and O
don't O
do O
n't O
believe O
that O
this O
should O
be O
a O
distinguishing O
factor N
on O
deciding O
between O
the O
cruise N
lines N
. O

Shows N
Each O
night N
there O
are O
a O
variety N
of O
shows N
. O

Usually O
you H
have O
the O
main O
show O
and O
some O
type N
of O
entertainment N
before O
and O
perhaps O
afterward O
. O

We H
felt N
that O
the O
main O
shows N
on O
the O
Mariner O
of O
the O
Seas O
were O
better O
. O

On O
the O
Liberty O
we H
liked O
the O
comedian H
and O
juggling N
act N
. O

If O
you H
love O
seeing O
the O
shows N
, O
Royal O
Caribbean O
was O
better O
for O
the O
main O
shows N
and O
Carnival O
was O
slightly O
better O
for O
the O
comedians H
. O

Dining N
Room N
We H
enjoyed O
the O
atmosphere N
of O
both O
dining N
rooms N
on O
the O
Liberty O
and O
Mariner O
of O
the O
Seas O
. O

We H
felt N
that O
the O
menu N
had O
a O
little O
more O
variety N
on O
the O
Mariner O
of O
the O
Seas O
. O

Friendliness N
of O
staff N
The O
Liberty O
and O
Mariner O
of O
the O
Seas O
both O
get O
high O
grades N
. O

We H
did O
have O
one N
waiter H
that O
complained O
some O
on O
one N
of O
our H
trips N
on O
the O
Mariner O
. O

We H
had O
a O
slightly O
better O
experience N
on O
the O
Liberty O
, O
but O
feel O
that O
both O
crews N
did O
an O
excellent O
job N
and O
that O
this O
should O
not O
be O
a O
distinguishing O
factor N
on O
choosing O
a O
cruise N
. O

Pools N
The O
Mariner O
of O
the O
Seas O
and O
Liberty O
both O
had O
salt N
water N
pools N
- O
which O
most O
cruise N
ships N
have O
. O

They O
both O
had O
pools N
for O
kids H
and O
adults H
. O

We H
liked O
the O
Liberty's O
Liberty O
's H
pools N
better O
because O
one N
had O
a O
slide N
. O

If O
you H
have O
kids H
, O
this O
would O
be O
something O
that O
they O
would O
definitely O
enjoy O
. O

Spa O
We H
tried O
the O
spa N
on O
the O
Liberty O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

We H
did O
not O
try O
the O
spa N
on O
the O
Mariner O
of O
the O
Seas O
. O

Usually O
you H
can't O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
when O
getting O
a O
spa N
treatment N
...... O

Royal O
Caribbean O
is O
better O
, O
but O
the O
best O
cruiseline O
is O
Regent O
Seven O
Seas O
. O

What O
do O
you H

do O
? O

Big O

Just O
as O
numerous O
as O
the O
possibilities N
of O
the O
US O
. O

Do O
you H
speak O
a O
foreign O
language N
? O

I H
could O
spend O
a O
year N
in O
Spain O
alone O
. O

From O
Madrid O
to O
Seville O
to O
Barcelona O
an O
Valencia O
. O

Bilboa O
on O
the O
north O

, O
Pamplona O

the O
very O

A H

before O
heading O
over O
to O

and O
Austria O
and O
Switzerland O
. O

I've O
I H
've O
traveled O
to O
all O
of O
these O
places N
and O
could O
certainly O
tailor H
a O
trip N
to O
your H
needs N
based O
on O
budget N
, O
actual O
time N
allowed O
, O
your H
likes O
and O
dislikes N
. O

Amount N
of O
time N
could O
be O
dependent O
on O
so O
many O
things N
. O

Do O
you H
want O
to O
see O
all O
the O
sites N
or O
simply O
a O
few O
photos N
and O
on O
your H
way N
to O
the O
next O
place N
. O

Does O
your H
budget N
limit O
you H
to O
how O
long O
you H
can O
stay O
in O
each O
place N
? O

You H
need O
a O
lot N
of O
money N
for O
hotels N
, O
airfare N
, O
seeing O
the O
sites N
, O
food N
, O
local O
transport N
- O
you H
name N
it O
but O
life N
costs O
. O

Once O
you H
have O
a O
budget N
or O
an O
amount N
in O
the O
bank N
then O
you'll O
you H
'll O
be O
able O
to O
figure O
out H
where O
you H
can O
go O
, O
for O
how O
long O
you H
can O
go O
and O
what O
you H
can O
do O
when O
you're O
you H
're O
there O
. O

Europass O

You H

the O

come O

How O
do O
you H
make O
your H
cat A
adjust O
to O
a O
new O
house N
? O

Me H
and O
my H
family H
are O
moving O
into O
a O
new O
house N
just O
outside O
a O
small O
town N
. O

We H
are O
currently O
living O
a O
mile N
from O
the O
town N
in O
a O
house N
surrounded O
by O
fields N
but O
the O
new O
house N
is O
beside O
a O
busy O
road N
. O

We H
have O
had O
the O
cat A
for O
10 O
years N
and O
dont O
do O
nt O
want O
to O
leave O
it O
. O

How O
could O
we H
make O
it O
settle O
in O
a O
new O
house N
. O

you H
are O
not O
just O
moving O
house N
- O
your H
cat A
is O
losing O
his O
territory N
. O

territory N
is O
very O
important O
to O
cats A
, O
and O
they O
are O
very O
nervous O
when O
they O
go O
into O
a O
new O
place N
- O
a O
new O
house N
could O
be O
full O
of O
predators A
, O
or O
unknown O
menaces N
- O
well O
at O
least O
he O
thinks O
so O
. O

you H
will O
need O
to O
give O
him O
only O
a O
small O
place N
to O
explore O
, O
so O
he O
can O
make O
it O
his O
territory N
, O
and O
feel O
safe O
there O
. O

then O
, O
he O
can O
have O
a O
place N
to O
retreat N
to O
when O
he O
feels O
scared O
. O

you H
will O
need O
to O
get O
his O
box N
and O
bowls N
, O
and O
whatever O
blanket N
and O
toys N
are O
his O
, O
and O
smell O
like O
home N
, O
and O
put O
him O
in O
a O
room N
. O

the O
room N
you H
sleep O
in O
is O
best O
( O
seeing O
you H
so O
relaxed O
that O
you H
are O
sleeping O
will O
send O
the O
message N
that O
everything O
is O
OK O
) O
, O
but O
others O
will O
work N
just O
as O
well O
. O

close O
the O
door N
, O
and O
keep O
him O
in O
there O
for O
a O
week N
. O

he O
will O
feel O
much O
safer O
in O
that O
one N
room N
, O
than O
in O
a O
huge O
unknown O
house N
. O

he O
will O
explore O
the O
room N
, O
mark N
everything O
with O
his O
cheek N
, O
and O
try O
to O
make O
it O
feel O
like O
his O
territory N
. O

he O
will O
reassure O
himself O
that O
no O
other O
animal A
is O
in O
there O
, O
and O
that O
no O
other O
animal A
will O
come O
in O
- O
he O
is O
afraid O
that O

in O
a O
week's O
week N

time N

let O

half O
an O
hour N

to O
explore O

then O
put O

he O
will O
be O
freaked O
out H

so O
going O

will O
make O
him O
much O
happier O
. O

extend O
the O
time N

but O
for O
the O
first O
month N
, O
always O
put O
him O

I H
just O
adopted O
a O
2 O
year N
old O
male O
German O
Shepherd O
with O
Major O
bad O
behaviors N
? O

Last O
night N
, O
I H
adopted O
a O
2 O
year N
old O
Male O
German O
Shepherd O
. O

( O
He O
is O
92 O
pounds N
) O
He O
does O
not O
listen O
to O
any O
commands N
, O
but O
my H
major O
problem N
is O
that O
he O
will O
not O
go O
outside O
on O
command O
, O
or O
even O
with O
me H
. O

I H
will O
walk O
outside O
and O
he O
will O
stand O
at O
the O
door N
and O
stare O
at O
me H
or O
run O
away O
. O

My H
other O
MAJOR O
problem N
is O
that O
he O
will O
not O
get O
in O
his O
crate N
. O

I H
will O
get O
a O
treat O
and O
try O
to O
get O
him O
in O
there O
that O
way N
, O
it O
wont O
wo O
nt O
work N
. O

He O
wont O
wo O
nt O
even O
get O
close O
to O
the O
crate N
. O

If O
I H
come O
towards O
him O
, O
he O
will O
run O
away O
. O

How O
do O
I H
train N
him O
to O
feel O
comfortable O
in O
his O
crate N
? O

and O
to O
willingly O
go O
outside O
... O
and O
to O
come O
on O
command O
. O

He O
wont O
wo O
nt O
do O
anything O
on O
command O
. O

Its O
It O
s H
very O
frustrating O
. O

I H
have O
a O
9 O
month N
old O
German O
Shepherd O
that O
I H
raised O
from O
a O
puppy A
. O

I H
trained O
her O
myself H
. O

She O
is O
crate N
trained O
, O
potty N
trained O
, O
and O
can O
sit O
, O
lay O
down O
, O
stay O
, O
come O
, O
fetch O
, O
and O
will O
even O
stay O
in O
a O
down O
position N
while O
I H
throw O
a O
treat O
across O
the O
floor N
or O
even O
right O
next O
to O
her O
paw O
, O
and O
she O
wont O
wo O
nt O
get O
it O
until O
I H
give O
her O
the O
command O
. O

Yes O
, O
lots N
of O
time N
and O
lots N
of O
patients H
... O

I H
just O
dont O
do O
nt O
know O
how O
to O
do O
it O
with O
a O
grown O
dog A
. O

She O
tosses O
me H
around O
like O
its O
it O
s H
nothing N
! O

... O
but O
basically O
, O
what O
I H
do O
is O
the O
same O
thing N
I H
did O
with O
my H
puppy A
... O
lots N
of O
patience N
, O
lots N
of O
time N
, O
lots N
of O
praise N
, O
lots N
of O
treats O
, O
and O
lots N
of O
repition O
.... O
Right O
? O

Is O
there O
any O
tricks N
I H
could O
use H
? O

Maybe O
get O
a O
book O
on O
training N
. O

You H
have O
to O
be O
in O
command O
at O
all O
times N
. O

There O
are O
ways N
to O
get O
your H
new O
dog A
used O
to O
the O
crate N
or O
going O
out H
. O

I H
would O
start O
with O
a O
leash N
. O

Put O
the O
leash N
on O
the O
dog A
and O
just O
walk O
around O
the O
crate N
a O
few O
times N
. O

Then O
take O
the O
leash N
off O
and O
do O
nothing N
else O
but O
that O
. O

Later O
do O
it O
again O
. O

When O
the O
dog A
is O
ok O
with O
this O
, O
then O
open O
the O
door N
and O
walk O
around O
the O
crate N
, O
leave O
the O
door N
open O
all O
the O
time N
. O

Put O
something O
fun O
inside O
. O

Let O
your H
dog A
go O
in O
when O
he O
wants O
to O
for O
no O
reason N
. O

Do O
not O
shut O
the O
door N
. O

Let O
him O
walk O
in O
and O
out H
for O
a O
few O
days N
. O

At O
some O
point N
he O
will O
feel O
ok O
with O
this O
and O
you H
can O
then O
close O
the O
door N
but O
not O
for O
long O
at O
all O
. O

Open O
the O
door N
and O
let O
him O
out H
and O
see O
how O
he O
acts N
. O

If O
you H
push O
it O
, O
it O
will O
never O
work N
. O

With O
going O
outside O
, O
put O
the O
leash N
on O
and O
just O
take O
him O
for O
a O
walk O
. O

He O
will O
learn O
to O
really O
like O
this O
. O

Potty N
outside O
will O
come O
at O
some O
point N
. O

Try O
obedience N
classes N
. O

Have O
patience N
with O
him O
, O
you H
just O
got O
him O
and O
who O
knows O
how O
he O
was O
treated O
before O
you H
brought O
him O
home N
. O

where O
can O
I H
find O
the O
best O
tours N
to O
the O
Mekong O
Delta O
at O
reasonable O
prices N
? O

will O
only O
be O
in O
Ho O
chi O
Minh O
for O
4 O
days N
and O
I H
am O
looking O
for O
a O
1 O
day N
or O
2 O
day N
trip N
to O
Mekong O
delta N
. O

I H
have O
been O
researching O
on O
line N
and O
find O
things N
are O
quite O
pricey O
but O
the O
tours N
look O
great O
. O

Should O
I H
just O
settle O
and O
book O
on O
line N
? O

or O
is O
it O
better O
if O
I H
wait N
till O
I H
get O
there O
? O

If O
I H
wait N
, O
would O
the O
tours N
I H
find O
there O
for O
less O
money N
be O
the O
same O
quality N
type N
tours N
? O

Also O
, O
any O
tour N
recommendations N
would O
be O
very O
helpful O
a O
well O
. O

Thank O

If O

I H
have O
taken O
this O
tour N
and O
it O

I H
did O
an O
overnight O
in O
a O
home N
stay O
that O

sweet O
and O
the O
water N
market N
was O
wonderful O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
remember O
the O
exact O
cost O
but O
remember O
thinking O
how O
inexpensive O
it O
was O
. O

Also O
, O
Sinh O
Cafe O
has O
been O
around O
for O
a O
long O
time N

is O
very O
reputable O

Oh O

There O
isn't O
is O
n't O
much O
to O
see O
in O
the O
delta N

it's O
it O
's H
a O

you H
can O
take O
a O

a O
local O

buying O
souvenirs N

doing O
other O
things N

are O

The O

very O
beautiful O

especially O
if O
you H
have O
a O
few O
months N
( O
or O
years N

It's O
It O

a O
little O
hard O
to O
get O
to O
by O
foot N
, O
they're O
they O

He'll O
He O

of O
their O
North H
to O
South O
Vietnam O
Trip N
, O
but O
they O
do O
offer O
this O
one N
day N
separately O
. O

We H
had O
a O
great O
time N
and O
visited O
a O
location N
where O
they O
made O
coconut N
candies N
, O
visited O
a O
local O
restaurant N
which O
was O
attached O
to O
a O
fish A
farm N
, O
rode O
in O
modified O
quad N
bikes N
and O
had O
some O
tropical O
food N
at O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
local O
hangout N
. O

Intrepid O
is O
good O
at O
getting O
you H
away O
from O
the O
most O
touristy O
spots N
and O
showing O
you H
something O
a O
little O
different O
. O

yoga N
and O
horses A
..... O
? O

I H
got O
a O
riding N
lesson N
today N
on O
one N
of O
my H
boss's O
boss A
's H
fino O
horses A
and O
it O
made O
me H
realize O
just O
how O
unsteady O
my H
left O
leg N
is O
. O

I H
mentioned O
it O
to O
my H
boss A
and O
she O
said O
to O
start O
doing O
yoga N
. O

But O
there O
are O
just O
so O
many O
poses N
and O
programs N
! O

Any O
good O
poses N
or O
programs N
( O
I'm O
I H
'm O
willing O
to O
buy O
a O
dvd N
as O
long O
as O
it O
is O
under O
$ O
20 O
) O
to O
help O
specifically O
with O
leg N
stabilization N
? O

I H
just O
have O
a O
few O
issues N
supporting O
my H
back O
and O
my H
left O
leg N
flops N
. O

Because O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
feel O
like O
spending N
over O
$ O
20 O
on O
a O
freakin O
DVD N

I H
also O
have O
back O
problems N
that O
transfer H
into O
my H
legs N
. O

I H
have O
done O
Yoga N
for O
riders H
for O
a O
while O
, O
a O
20 O
minute O
routine N
I H
found O
on O
YouTube O
( O
I H
think O
its O
it O
s H
called O
" O
Yoga N
for O
horse A
back O
riding N
" O
hosted O
by O
a O
man H
) O
It O
helped O
with O
noticing O
slight O
differences N
in O
my H
balance O
and O
weight N
distribution N
but O
helped O
not O
really O
for O
the O
way N
I H
use H
my H
legs N
and O
back O
. O

Here O
is O
what O
I H
do O
now O
and O
it O
really O
helps O
.... O

When O
I H
first O
get O
on O
I H
take O
1 O
leg N
and O
pull O
it O
back O
up O
to O
touch O
my H
butt N
with O
my H
heel N
and O
hold O
it O
there O
for O
1 O
lap O
at O
a O
walk O
around O
a O
large O
dressage N
arena N
. O

Then O
the O
same O
thing N
with O
the O
other O
leg N
. O

Then O
1 O
lap O
at O
a O
walk O
around O
the O
arena N
with O
both O
my H
legs N
pulled O
out H
as O
far O
as O
I H
can O
, O
so O
they O
are O
not O
touching O
the O
saddle N
. O

Then O
a O
lap O
doing O
scissors N
, O
one N
leg N
forward O
as O
far O
as O
I H
can O
and O
the O
other O
back O
, O
then O
switch N
legs N
. O

I'll O
I H
'll O
also O
trot N
doing O
, O
down O
2 O
beats N
, O
up O
one N
for O
a O
wile N
, O
then O
up O
2 O
down O
1 O
making O
sure O
the O
weight N
is O
going O
into O
the O
balls N
of O
my H
feet N
. O

If O
the O
weight N
is O
going O
into O
your H
heels N
( O
it O
throws O
your H
leg N
forward O
) O
put O
the O
stirrups N
up O
against O
the O
heel N
of O
your H
boot O
. O

Do O
a O
nice O
working O
trot N
, O
not O
a O
slow O
trot N
. O

All O
this O
will O
help O
you H
use H
both O
legs N
evenly O
, O
keep O
proper O
contact O
and O
use H
your H
wight H
correctly O
, O
to O
keep O
your H
leg N
in O
a O
good O
position N
. O

BTW O
you H
dont O
do O
nt O
want O
your H
leg N
locked O
in O
place N
, O
it O
will O
move O
WITH O
the O
horse A
a O
bit N
. O

When O
I H
first O
started O
doing O
it O
I'd O
I H
'd O
do O
it O
every O
day N
. O

Now O
I H
just O
do O
it O
once O
or O
twice O
a O
week N
or O
as O
needed O
. O

Now O
not O
only O
is O
my H
leg N
better O
, O
but O
my H
back O
is O
relaxing O
. O

) O
and O

You H
don't O

want O
to O

than O

expensive O

What O
to O
feed O
my H
dog A
after O
gastroenteritis N
? O

My H
dog A

He O
has O
been O
having O
diarheya N
everywhere O
and O
he O
began O
to O
vomit O
last O

. O

I H
thought O
it O
would O
pass O
until O
he O
started O
to O
vomit O
blood N
and O
wouldnt O
would O
nt O
drink N
any O
water N
. O

I H
took O
him O
to O
the O
Animal O
Hospital O
and O
they O
ran O
blood N
work N
and O
everything O
came O
back O
normal O
. O

No O
pancreatitis N
or O
anything O
abnormal O
. O

The O
vet H
said O
it O
was O
gastroenteritis N
and O
gave O
him O
fluids N
under O
his O
skin N
, O
an O
injection N
of O
nausea N
medication N
along O
with O
some O
take O
home N
antibiotics N
. O

So O
my H
question N
is O
.. O

Is O
it O
normal O
for O
dogs A
to O
throw O
up O
blood N
while O
having O
gastroenteritis N
? O

and O
will O
these O
antibiotics N
help O
? O

I H
have O
tryed O
to O
give O
him O

but O
he O
wont O

it O
.. O

To O
answer N
your H
questions N
in O
order O
: O

1 O
) O
It O
is O
not O
normal O
for O
dogs A
to O
be O
vomiting O
, O
much O
less O
to O
have O
blood N
in O
it O
. O

However O
, O
if O
they O
have O
been O
vomiting O
numerous O
times N
, O
then O
the O
blood N
could O
be O
due O
to O
irritation N
of O
the O
stomach N
and O
intestines N
. O

He O
could O
also O
have O
Parvovirus O
, O
a O
GI N
foreign O
body N
, O
or O
any O
number N
of O
things N
. O

Did O
your H
vet H
take O
radiographs N
( O
x O
- O
rays N
) O
? O

2 O
) O
Your H
vet H
would O
not O
prescribe O
them O
if O
they O
didn't O
did O
n't O
think O
it O
would O
be O
helpful O
. O

3 O
) O
If O
he O
shows N
no O
interest N
in O
water N
, O
then O
take O
him O
back O
to O
your H
vet H
. O

It O
could O
be O
due O
to O
nausea N
or O
any O
number N
of O
things N
. O

He O
could O
become O
severly O
dehydrated O
( O
especially O
if O
he O
continues O
to O
vomit O
and O
have O
diarrhea N
) O
. O

From O
there O
you H
end N
up O
with O
electrolyte N
imbalances N
, O
which O
can O
lead O
to O
heart N
and O
kidney N
problems N
. O

And O
being O
dehydrated O
, O
vomiting O
, O
and O
having O
diarrhea N
just O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
feel O
good O
. O

4 O
) O
Call O
your H
vet H
. O

They O
should O
have O
discussed O
a O
bland O
diet N
with O
you H
, O
including O
the O
frequency N
of O
feeding O
and O
how O
much O
to O
feed O
at O
each O
sitting O
. O

It O
sounds N
like O
your H
dog A
may O
benefit N
from O
being O
hospitalized O
, O
and O
put O
on O
IV O
fluids N
to O
help O
his O
hydration N
, O
administer O
the O
antibiotics N
IV O
, O
and O
to O
ensure O
that O
he O
starts O
to O
recover O
. O

You H
should O
ABSOLUTELY O
call O
your H
veterinarian H
back O
immediately O
to O
clarify O
anything O
you H
have O
questions N
about O
. O

They O
have O
seen O
your H
pet A
, O
and O
are O
most O
aware O
of O
his O
condition N
. O

No O
one N
online O
will O
be O
able O
to O
assist O
you H
more O
than O
your H
vet H
can O
. O

You H
need O
to O
ask O
your H
vet H
these O
questions N
. O

Boiled O
WHITE O
rice N
and O
boiled O
chicken N
breast N
. O

Bland O
food N
. O

NO O
SPICES N
! O

My H
vet H
told O
me H
when O
a O
dog A
is O
vomiting O
a O
lot N
, O
it O
could O
be O
a O
sign N
of O
obstruction N
. O

Did O
they O
do O
any O
x O
- O
rays N
? O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
vomiting O
blood N
is O
common O
with O
this O
ailment N
. O

You H
should O
call O
your H
vet H
now O
and O
ask O
them O
what O
is O
normal O
or O
not O
. O

French O
dating O
etiquette N
? O

I H
would O
really O
love O
to O
hear O
what O
the O
French O
or O
those O
who O
had O
dated O
the O
French O
have O
to O
say O
something O
about O
this O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
in O
my H
20's N
and O
currently O
studying O
in O
France O
. O

Coming O
from O
an O
anglo O
- O
saxon O
country N
my H
version N
of O
dating O
is O
' O
getting O
the O
number N
, O
asking O
her O
out H
, O
etc. O
. O
' O

However O
, O
I've O
I H
've O
read O
on O
the O
internet N
that O
the O
French O
dating O
etiquette N
is O
totally O
different O
. O

For O
them O
, O
dating O
would O
normally O
be O
meeting N
in O
groups N
or O
parties N
, O
then O
pairing O
off O
. O

In O
addition N
, O
from O
my H
understanding N
one N
- O
on O
- O
one N
dates O
is O
something O
that O
comes O
much O
later O
and O
not O
' O
straight O
- O
away O
' O
like O
us H
anglo O
- O
saxons O
. O

They O
are O
also O
very O
secretive O
about O
being O
in O
a O
relationship N
. O

They O
only O
' O
go O
out H
in O
the O
open O
' O
once O
they O
have O
reached O
a O
certain O
level N
of O
seriousness N
. O

Is O
it O
true O
? O

I H
have O
told O
a O
French O
girl H
I H
liked O
her O
, O
and O
she O
accepted O
. O

She O
is O
friendly O
when O
we H
see O
each O
other O
on O
campus N
. O

She O
is O
also O
nicer O
when O
we H
are O
both O
alone O
. O

However O
, O
when O
we H
are O
at O
parties N
or O
when O
they O
are O
people N
around O
she O
seems O
to O
ignore O
me H
. O

She O
also O
seems O
to O
hate O
it O
whenever O
I H
ask O
her O
out H
on O
a O
date N
, O
to O
the O
point N
she O
said O
stop N
! O

My H
mind N
thinks O
she O
has O
no O
interest N
in O
me H
and O
just O
stringing O
me H
along O
. O

But O
the O
articles N
I H
read O
seemed O
to O
say O
the O
contrary N
. O

Have O
I H
just O
fallen O
victim H
in O
a O
cultural O
trap N
? O

What O
you H
have O
read O
in O
the O
internet N
is O
fairly O
accurate O
but O
of O
course N
it O
does O
not O
fit O
all O
scenarios N
. O

You H
are O
not O
French O
for O
a O
start O
, O
so O
the O
" O
rules N
" O
or O
" O
customs N
" O
may O
not O
apply O
to O
you H
when O
it O
comes O
to O
entering O
into O
a O
relationship N
between O
people N
from O
different O
backgrounds N
. O

From O
what O
you H
say O
the O
messages N
given O
by O
this O
girl H
are O
quite O
clear N
. O

She O
is O
not O
stringing O
you H
along O
since O
she O
is O
actually O
discouraging O
you H
and O
is O
honest O
enough O
to O
tell O
you H
to O
stop N
asking O
her O
out H
. O

She O
is O
just O
being O
friendly O
in O
public O
because O
she O
does O
not O
want O
to O
offend O
you H
and O
she O
treats O
you H
like O
any O
other O
friend H
. O

You H
said O
you H
liked O
her O
and O
she O
accepted O
it O
as O
a O
truth N
and O
perhaps O
as O
a O
compliment O
, O
but O
it O
does O
not O
mean O
she O
fancies O
you H
or O
wants O
to O
pair N
off O
with O
you H
. O

At O
parties N
she O
does O
not O
want O
to O
be O
considered O
in O
any O
way N
attached O
to O
you H
, O
which O
is O
consistent O
. O

Take O
the O
messages N
for O
what O
they O
are O
: O
she O
has O
no O
objection N
in O
you H
being O
pals H
at O
uni O
, O
but O
she O
does O
not O
want O
to O
take O
matters N
further O
. O

" O
Non O
! O
" O
means N
" O
non O
" O
, O
not O
" O
I H
might O
consider O
it O
, O
and O
I H
will O
keep O
you H
attached O
to O
my H
apron N
strings N
just O
in O
case N
. O
" O

Christiane O
gave O
you H
a O
good O
answer N
. O

You H
have O
fallen O
in O
a O
cultural O
misunderstanding N
. O

What O
I H
have O
to O
add O
is O
that O
it O
is O
normal O
in O
France O
to O
have O
mixed O
gender N
groups N
of O
friends H
, O
there's O
there O
's H
nothing N
unusual O
in O
boys H
and O
girls H
being O
only O
friends H
, O
which O
is O
obviously O
what O
this O
girl H
wants O
from O
you H
. O

She O
probably O
finds O
your H
company N
pleasing O
as O
a O
friend H
but O
you H
are O
not O
her O
choice N
a O
a O
boyfriend H
and O
she O
is O
trying O
to O
keep O
it O
on O
a O
friendship N
level N
, O
and O
trying O
to O
make O
you H
understand O
that O
she O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
further O
. O

If O
she O
is O
nicer O
when O
you H
are O
alone O
I'd O
I H
'd O
say O
it O
is O
because O
in O
public O
view N
she O
is O
making O
sure O
that O
people N
do O
not O
think O
that O
you H
might O
be O
her O
boyfriend H
. O

You H
do O
find O
the O
' O
get O
the O
number N
hop O
in O
bed N
with O
her O
' O
but O
be O
aware O
that O
they O
usually O
have O
a O
reputation N
as O
sluts H
. O

Unfair O
for O
the O
girl H
as O
boys H
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
that O
kind N
of O
handicap N
, O
but O
that's O
that O
's H
the O
way N
our H
own O
rules N
work N
. O

Should O
have O
done O
research N
before O
you H
left O
. O

Why O
not O
just O
take O
your H
chances N
and O
do O
it O
your H
way N
? O

True O
or O
false O
: O
being O
a O
young O
New H
Zealander H
means N
having O
no O
future N
? O

There O
are O
no O
jobs N
in O
this O
country N
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
just O
trying O
to O
make O
up O
my H
mind N
whether O
I H
should O
move O
to O
Australia O
or O
seek O
work N
in O
the O
sex N
industry N
. O

Is O
there O
a O
future N
for O
our H
nation's O
nation N
's H
youth H
? O

@ O
Ryan H
B H
, O

I'm O
I H
'm O
two O
years N
into O
an O
undergraduate O
degree N
. O

Everybody O
I H
know O
at O
university N
intends O
to O
stay O
at O
uni O
for O
as O
long O
as O
possible O
until O
there O
are O
actually O
jobs N
available O
. O

Everybody O
seems O
to O
flee O
this O
country N
and O
move O
overseas O
, O
to O
Australia O
, O
etc O
. O

There's O
There O
's H
obviously O
a O
reason N
for O
that O
( O
lack N
of O
employment N
, O
low O
incomes N
, O
etc O
. O
) O

Your H
answer N
doesn't O
does O
n't O
do O
anything O
but O
remind O
me H
that O
I'm O
I H
'm O
going O
to O
be O
$ O
25,000 O
in O
debt N
by O
the O
time N
I'm O
I H
'm O
22 O
. O

So O
, O
thanks N
. O

@ O
W.a.b.b.y O
, O

I H
really O
like O
you're H
answer N
. O

it's O
it O
's H
very O
logical O
. O

I've O
I H
've O
also O
considered O
becoming O
a O
teacher H
, O
but O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
a O
job N
I'm O
I H
'm O
cut O
out H
for O
. O

I H
also O
wish O
I'd O
I H
'd O
applied O
for O
a O
scholarship N
. O

I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
think O
I'd O
I H
'd O
be O
awarded O
one N
, O
but O
I H
received O
the O
Dux O
Litterarum O
award N
at O
high O
school N
, O
so O
my H
chances N
were O
probably O
better O
than O
I H
thought O
they O
were O
. O

Obviously O
I'm O
I H
'm O
still O
completely O
stupid O
though O
. O

I H
mean O
, O
I H
wasn't O
was O
n't O
smart O
enough O
to O
apply O
for O
a O
scholarship N
. O

And O
yes O
, O
I H
am O
being O
melodramatic O
. O

Lol O
. O

@ O
Hatmanone O
, O

* O
gasps O
* O
So O
I H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
make O
a O
good O
prostitute H
? O

Are O
you H
saying O
I'm O
I H
'm O
bad O
in O
bed N
? O

How O
would O
you H
know O
? O

Joking O
. O

Your H
answer N
is O
very O
sweet O
, O
but O
I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
compassionate O
towards O
teenage O
high O
school N
students H
. O

A H
little O
mellow O
dramatic O
? O

In O
my H
opinion N
, O
far O
too O
many O
people N
are O
at O
university N
studying O
worthless O
degrees N
. O

Yes O
things N
like O
philosophy N
and O
fashion N
design N
are O
interesting O
, O
but O
how O
many O
jobs N
are O
out H
there O
for O
someone H
with O
these O
qualifications N
? O

I'm O
I H
'm O
studying O
to O
be O
a O
teacher H
, O
so O
I H
know O
that O
there O
will O
definitely O
be O
jobs N
out H
there O
when O
I'm O
I H
'm O
done O
. O

I H
may O
have O
to O
live O
somewhere O
rural O
or O
in O
Auckland O
, O
but O
at O
least O
I H
can O
be O
pretty O
sure O
I'll O
I H
'll O
be O
employable O
. O

I've O
I H
've O
also O
got O
a O
bachelors O
bachelor H
s H
degree N
so O
I H
can O
go O
back O
and O
do O
further O
study O
or O
take O
a O
different O
profession N
. O

I H
also O
know O
that O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
get O
paid O
that O
much O
more O
in O
Australia O
than O
you H
do O
here O
. O

And O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
all O
about O
how O
much O
you H
earn O
, O
cost O
of O
living O
is O
much O
higher O
in O
many O

Try O
living O
in O
Sydney O
on O
a O
teacher's O
teacher H
's H
salary N
, O
then O
compare O
it O
to O
somewhere O
like O
Central O
Otago O
. O

You H
also O
have O
to O
put O
up O
with O
all O
the O
annoying O
accents N

Australia O

It's O
It O
's H
probably O
not O
a O
wise O
idea N
to O
keep O
studying O
and O
having O
a O
massive O
student H
loan N
. O

At O
the O
moment N
there's O
there O
's H
no O
interest N
, O
but O
that'll O
that O
'll O
probably O
change O
. O

And O
they'll O
they O
'll O
probably O
add O
interest N
to O
what O
you've O
you H
've O
already O
racked O
up O
. O

And O
they're O
they O
're O
working O
towards O
being O
able O
to O
extradite O
people N
who O
have O
left O
the O
country N
to O
avoid O
paying O
it O
back O
. O

At O
the O
moment N
if O
you H
move O
overseas O
you H
can O
only O
come O
back O
to O
New H
Zealand O
for O
a O
short O
amount N
of O
time N
before O
they'll O
they O
'll O
force N
you H
cough O
up O
. O

And O
all O
that O
time N
you're H
you H
're O
overseas O
you'll O
you H
'll O
be O
racking O
up O
interest N

I H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
like O
not O
having O
the O
option N
to O
return O

NZ O
. O

I H
guess O
I'm O
I H
'm O
extremely O
fortunate O
that O
I H
received O
a O
scholarship N
which O
paid O
about O
800 O
f N
my H
course N

through O
my H
degree N

But O
I H
worked O
hard O
and O
I'm O
I H
'm O
still O
working O
hard O
. O

There O
are O
far O
too O
many O
lazy O
people N
out H
there O
who O
think O
that O
they O
can O
sit O
around O
a O

I'm O
I H

Whilst O

roughly O
a O

20 O

so O
it's O
it O

why O
does O
my H
baby H
king H
snake A
refuse O
to O
eat O
? O

i H
have O
a O
baby H
eastern O
king H
snake A
. O

i H
have O
tried O
EVERYTHING O
i H
can O
try O
to O
get O
him O
to O
eat O
but O
he O
refuses O
. O

he O
has O
a O
great O
environment N
, O
with O
water N
and O
lots N
of O
hiding O
places N
and O
a O
heat N
lamp N
. O

as O
far O
as O
i H
know O
, O
everything O
is O
as O
good O
as O
it O
can O
be O
where O
his O
aquarium N
is O
concerned O
. O

according O
to O
the O
vet H
, O
he O
is O
healthy O
and O
looks O
good O
. O

he O
has O
been O
going O
to O
the O
bathroom N
like O
he O
should O
. O

( O
i H
know O
that O
snakes A
that O
have O
problems N
going O
to O
the O
bathroom N
won't O
wo O
n't O
eat O
. O
) O

he O
has O
been O
drinking O
water N
( O
i H
am O
pretty O
sure O
he O
has O
been O
drinking O
it O
out H
of O
his O
bowl N
, O
but O
also O
i H
have O
been O
feeding O
him O
water N
and O
he O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
ever O
give O
me H
a O
problem N
with O
that O
- O
i H
just O
stick N
his O
head N
near O
the O
water N
and O
he O
sucks O
it O
down O
. O
) O

i H
handle N
him O
every O
few O
days N
. O

he O
is O
feisty O
, O
as O
most O
king H
snakes A
are O
, O
but O
he O
is O
a O
very O
nice O
little O
guy H
- O
he O
never O
tries O
to O
bite N
or O
anything O
. O

i H
just O
love O
him O
to O
death N
. O

i H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
he O
won't O
wo O
n't O
eat O
though O
! O

i H
have O
tried O
feeding O
him O
5 O
or O
6 O
live O
pinkies N
and O
4 O
or O
5 O
frozen O
( O
thawed O
) O
pinkies N
. O

i H
have O
never O
tried O
feeding O
him O
a O
pinky N
that O
was O
bigger O
around O
than O
he O
is O
. O

i H
have O
tried O
putting O
him O
in O
a O
small O
container N
and O
putting O
him O
in O
a O
dark O
place N
for O
an O
hour N
or O
so O
and O
he O
won't O
wo O
n't O
touch O
the O
pinky N
. O

he O
crawls O
on O
top N
of O
them O
but O
does O
not O
try O
to O
eat O
them O
. O

he O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
know O
that O
they O
are O
food N
. O

i H
have O
tried O
" O
braining O
" O
both O
live O
and O
dead O
pinkies N
, O
and O
bloodying O
them O
up O
to O
get O
his O
attention N
, O
but O
he O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
care N
. O

i H
have O
tried O
dipping O
both O
live O
and O
thawed O
pinkies N
in O
tuna A
juice N
, O
and O
in O
used O
gerbil A
bedding N
. O

i H
have O
bought O
some O
long O
reptile A
feeding O
tweezers N
and O
have O
tried O
holding O
the O
pinky N
in O
front N
of O
the O
snake's O
snake A
's H
face N
. O

he O
wont O
wo O
nt O
even O
try O
to O
bite N
. O

i H
am O
very O
discouraged O
and O
sad O
and O
i H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
do O
. O

he O
hasn't O
has O
n't O
eaten O
in O
an O
entire O
month N
. O

i've O
i H
've O
only O
tried O
to O
feed O
him O
one N
at O
a O
time N
. O

he's O
he O
's H
just O
a O
tiny O
baby H
, O
about O
the O
width N
of O
a O
pencil N
. O

do O
babies H
this O
small O
hibernate O
? O

When O
you H
feed O
him O
how O
many O
pinkies N
do O
you H
feed O
him O
? O

If O
you H
feed O
him O
too O
many O
he O
could O
just O
not O
be O
hungry O
. O

If O
he O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
seem O
interested O
in O
them O
at O
all O
I H
would O
say O
he's O
he O
's H
just O
not O
hungry O
. O

My H
boyfriend H
has O
one N
and O
when O
she's O
she O
's H
hungry O
she O
attacks N
the O
pinkie N
right O
away O
. O

They O
can O
smell O
it O
so O
i'm O
i H
'm O
sure O
he O
knows O
what O
it O
is O
and O
just O
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
it O
. O

Remember O
snakes A
can O
go O
awhile O
a O
while O
without O
eating O
. O

In O
the O
winter N
, O
they O
will O
usually O
go O
deep O
underground O
and O
enter O
a O
hibernation N
- O
like O
state N
called O
brumation O
, O
which O
is O
characterized O
by O
a O
slowed O
metabolism N
and O
reduced O
activity N
. O

King O
snakes A
sometimes O
stop N
eating O
, O
particularly O
during O
the O
cooler O
part N
of O
the O
year N
. O

They O
have O
a O
natural O
instinct N
to O
hibernate O
. O

If O
the O
snake A
is O
not O
pregnant O
or O
shedding N
, O
and O
its O
enclosure N
is O
properly O
equipped O
, O
a O
loss N
of O
appetite N
probably O
signals N
a O
beginning O
of O
hibernation N
. O

Hibernation N
is O
natural O
, O
and O
a O
necessity N
for O
snakes A
that O
are O
going O
to O
be O
bred O
. O

Another O
thing N
that O
can O
cause N
a O
king H
snake A
to O
stop N
eating O
is O
shedding N
. O

You H
can O
tell O
when O
your H
king H
snake A
is O
about O
to O
shed O
, O
because O
its O
eyes N
will O
get O
milky O
looking O
. O

Its O
body N
will O
be O
dull O
looking O
, O
too O
. O

In O
a O
few O
days N
the O
snake A
will O
begin O
to O
shed O
its O
skin N
. O

For O
example N
, O
some O
snakes A
will O
routinely O
go O
off O
their O
food N
in O
both O
the O
summer N
and O
winter N
, O
feeding O
mainly O
in O
spring N
and O
fall N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
natural O
and O
so O
long O
as O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
see O
any O
serious O
deterioration N
in O
their O
health N
is O
nothing N
to O
worry O
about O
. O

You H
see O
, O
some O
snakes A
for O
no O
obvious O
reason N
will O
simply O
go O
off O
their O
food N
. O

They're O
They O
're O
fit O
and O
healthy O
and O
their O
care N
is O
suitable O
. O

hope O
this O
helped O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
why O
it's O
it O
's H
good O
to O
have O
a O
python A
! O

It's O
It O
's H
twice O
my H
size N
and O
eats O
a O
rabbit A
once O
a O
month N
. O

are O
my H
two O
cats A
fighting O
or O
playing O
? O

how O
rough O
is O
too O
rough O
? O

help O
!? O

i H
have O
a O
1 O
and O
a O
half O
year N
old O
male O
neutered O
cat A
and O
a O
new O
2 O
month N
old O
spayed O
female O
kitten A
. O

the O
first O
night N
i H
brought O
her O
home N
i H
did O
the O
sniffing O
under O
the O
door N
thing N
and O
left O
it O
at O
that O
. O

the O
next O
day N
i H
let O
her O
out H
of O
the O
bedroom N
so O
they O
could O
check O
each O
other O
out H
, O
and O
the O
kitten A
hissed O
twice O
within O
the O
first O
20 O
minutes N
of O
meeting N
each O
other O
and O
now O
she O
no O
longer O
hisses O
and O
they O
have O
been O
playing O
( O
chasing O
each O
other O
up O
and O
down O
the O
hall N
, O
rolling O
around O
on O
the O
ground N
and O
pawing O
at O
each O
other O
) O
. O

only O
once O
it O
looked O
like O
my H
male O
cat A
was O
biting O
at O
her O
neck N
and O
then O
her O
stomach N
and O
she O
was O
meowing O
fairly O
loud O
and O
hissed O
once O
then O
he O
backed O
off O
and O
now O
they O
are O
fine O
. O

were O
they O
roughhouse O
playing O
? O

or O
were O
they O
actually O
fighting O
? O

he O
has O
been O
" O
biting O
" O
at O
her O
neck N
and O
stomach N
previously O
while O
they O
play O
without O
her O
meowing O
or O
anything O
so O
im O
i H
m O
wondering O
if O
he O
went O
a O
little O
to O
far O
that O
one N
time N
. O

any O
answers N
help O
!!!!!! O

you H
did O
not O
leave O
the O
new O
kitten A
in O
the O
room N
long O
enough O
. O

you H
need O
to O
do O
that O
for O
a O
least O
a O
week N
, O
or O
else O
this O
type N
of O
territorial O
fighting O
will O
happen O
. O

giving O
the O
new O
kitten A
her O
own O
small O
territory N
will O
help O
her O
to O
feel O
safe O
and O
will O
give O
her O
a O
place N
to O
go O
to O
when O
scared O
. O

right O
now O
, O
your H
male O
is O
fighting O
off O
an O
intruder H
, O
and O
he O
feels O
that O
all O
of O
the O
house N
is O
his O
. O

put O
her O
back O
in O
the O
room N
, O
and O
keep O
the O
door N
closed O
for O
a O
week N
. O

then O
let O
her O
out H
for O
ten O
minutes N
. O

make O
it O
fifteen O
the O
next O
day N
, O
then O
twenty O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

this O
will O
do O
two O
things N
; O
the O
new O
kitten A
will O
rub O
her O
cheek N
on O
the O
furniture N
in O
her O
room N
, O
making O
it O
her O
territory N
. O

she O
will O
start O
to O
calm O
down O
and O
feel O
safe O
- O
you H
can O
bet N
she O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
now O
. O

she O
knows O
she O
is O
invading O
someone H
else's O
else O
's H
territory N
, O
but O
can't O
ca O
n't O
help O
it O
, O
and O
has O
no O
where O
to O
go O
. O

she O
will O
be O
able O
to O
sleep O
without O
being O
afraid O
. O

as O
well O
, O
your H
male O
will O
be O
able O
to O
see O
that O
his O
territory N
is O
not O
threatened O
. O

when O
the O
door N
opens O
, O
he O
will O
get O
that O
the O
one N
room N
is O
hers O
, O
and O
he O
will O
be O
OK O
with O
that O
. O

the O
territory N
thing N
will O
be O
solved O
. O

your H
male O
is O
hurting O
her O
to O
put O
her O
in O
her O
place N
- O
biting O
her O
scruff N
is O
dominance N
and O
biting O
the O
belly N
is O
a O
move O
cats A
use H
when O
hunting N
- O
to O
pull O
the O
guts N
out H
of O
their O
prey A
. O

this O
is O
not O
good O
. O

give O
them O
time N
to O
set O
up O
their O
territories N
, O
and O
once O
you H
bring O
the O
new O
kitten A
out H
, O
pay O
a O
lot N
of O
attention N
to O
the O
male O
. O

you H
have O
brought O
someone H
else O
into O
his O
territory N
, O
and O
he O
needs N
to O
be O
reminded O
that O
you H
still O
love O
him O
, O
and O
support N
his O
claim O
to O
his O
space N
. O

that O
will O
help O
to O
reassure O
him O
, O
and O
he O
will O
be O
less O
aggressive O
with O
her O
. O

when O
they O
play O
fight N
, O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
hiss N
. O

if O
they O
hiss N
, O
they O
are O
not O
playing O
. O

if O
they O
bite N
, O
and O
one N
cries O
, O
you H
must O
separate O
them O
, O
and O
you H
must O
keep O
an O
eye N
on O
them O
. O

hissing N
is O
OK O
, O
unless O
they O
start O
to O
fight N
. O

if O
that O
happens O
, O
separate O
them O
, O
and O
give O
them O
time N
apart O
. O

putting O
the O
girl H
in O
her O
territory N
will O
make O
her O
feel O
less O
afraid O
, O
and O
she O
will O
relax O
. O

good O
luck N
! O

A H
hiss N
is O
basically O
a O
" O
get O
the O
f*ck N
away O
" O
sound N
. O

It O
means N
they've O
they O
've O
gone O
too O
far O
. O

When O
they O
start O
bleeding O
that O
means N
they're O
they O
're O
really O
fighting O
. O

If O
they're O
they O
're O
going O
kinda O
slow O
and O
like O
fake O
biting O
( O
not O
biting O
as O
hard O
as O
they O
can O
) O
, O
and O
fake O
scratching O
( O
not O
hitting O
as O
hard O
as O
they O
can O
with O
their O
paws N
) O
then O
they're O
they O
're O
playing O
. O

I H
have O
two O
cats A
, O
and O
at O
first O
they O
hissed O
at O
each O
other O
because O
cats A
are O
very O
territorial O
, O
but O
now O
they O
do O
fight N
and O
play O
. O

The O
difference N
is O
when O
the O
cat A
hisses O
, O
that O
means N
they O
are O
annoyed O
and O
they O
want O
the O
other O
cat A
to O
go O
away O
. O

That O
means N
they O
are O
fighting O
. O

When O
they O
are O
just O
jumping O
at O
each O
other O
and O
their O
tails N
are O
wagging O
that O
means N
that O
they O
are O
playing O
. O

I H
can O
see O
how O
you H
get O
confused O
though O
. O
:) O

What O
was O
the O
goal N
for O
North H
Vietnam O
in O
the O
Tet O
offensive O
? O

When O
Johnson H
deployed O
troops N
in O
1964 O
he O
was O
advised O
by O
the O
military O
it O
would O
take O
a O
half O
- O
million O
troops N
about O
ten O
years N
to O
pacify O
South O
Vietnam O
. O

He O
refused O
to O
believe O
them O
and O
ordered O
the O
military O
to O
win O
the O
war N
within O
two O
to O
three O
years N
( O
before O
the O
next O
election N
in O
1968 O
) O
. O

He O
did O
not O
give O
them O
the O
number N
of O
troops N
they O
requested O
. O

This O
left O
Westmoreland O
with O
few O
options N
, O
so O
he O
adapted O
a O
Search N
and O
Destroy O
strategy N
instead O
of O
a O
Clear O
and O
Defend O
strategy N
which O
is O
, O
in O
the O
long O
run O
, O
the O
preferred O
method N
of O
pacifying O
an O
insurgency N
. O

Thing N
is O
, O
it O
worked O
. O

The O
ARVN O
was O
not O
having O
a O
big O
problem N
with O
the O
Local O
VC O
( O
the O
guerilla H
movement N
) O
, O
they O
were O
being O
challenged O
by O
the O
Main O
Force O
VC O
( O
which O
was O
light N
infantry N
) O
and O
the O
North H
Vietnamese O
Army N
( O
NVA O
) O
. O

When O
the O
Americans O
swept O
in O
with O
their O
Search N
and O
Destroy O
operations N
the O
Communists O
quickly O
leaned O
they O
could O
not O
stand O
up O
to O
the O
US O
firepower N
, O
and O
these O
regular O
troops N
were O
forced O
to O
flee O
the O
country N
and O
take O
sanctuary N
across O
the O
borders N
in O
Laos O
and O
Cambodia O
. O

All O
those O
sunny O
reports N
about O
the O
progress N
in O
Vietnam O
were O
correct O
, O
the O
Communists O
WERE O
being O
defeated O
. O

However O
, O
Johnson H
would O
not O
let O
the O
military O
cross O
the O
borders N
and O
clean O
out H
the O
Communist O
bases O
. O

He O
was O
warned O
that O
they O
were O
building N
up O
a O
huge O
Army N
and O
would O
eventually O
launch N
an O
attack N
, O
but O
he O
ignored O
his O
military O
advisers H
. O

The O
Communists O
agreed O
. O

They O
could O
not O
defeat N
the O
Americans O
. O

However O
, O
what O
they O
hoped O
to O
do O
during O
the O
Tet O
Offensive O
was O
to O
sneak O
past N
the O
Americans O
and O
attack N
the O
ARVN O
in O
the O
urban O
areas N
where O
they O
were O
deployed O
doing O
successful O
Clear O
and O
Defend O
operations N
. O

The O
Communists O
thought O
they O
could O
defeat N
the O
ARVN O
, O
cause N
the O
fall N
of O
the O
South O
Vietnamese O
government N
, O
and O
the O
people N
would O
than O
rally O
to O
the O
Communist O
cause N
and O
leave O
the O
Americans O
stranded O
in O
a O
sea N
of O
angry O
peasants H
. O

THAT O
WAS O
THE O
PLAN N
. O

What O
happened O
? O

The O
Americans O
detected O
the O
attempt N
to O
infiltrate O
the O
urban O
areas N
and O
were O
already O
redeploying O
troops N
from O
the O
rural O
areas N
. O

The O
ARVN O
rushed O
back O
from O
holiday N
leave O
and O
counterattacked O
. O

Within O
24 O
hours N
every O
Communist O
assault N
had O
been O
defeated O
except O
in O
the O
ancient O
capital N
of O
Hue O
. O

The O
government N
did O
NOT O
fall N
. O

And O
the O
South O
Vietnamese O
people N
? O

When O
give O
the O
ultimate O
choice N
, O
they O
rallied O
… O

TO O
THE O
SOUTH O
VIETNAMESE O
GOVERNMENT N
…. O

Tet O
was O
a O
huge O
military O
and O
political O
disaster N
for O
the O
Communists O
. O

They O
were O
chased O
back O
into O
Laos O
and O
Cambodia O
with O
the O
ARVN O
in O
hot O
pursuit N
. O

The O
people N
rejected O
their O
attempt N
to O
topple O
the O
government N
, O
and O
for O
all O
intents N
and O
purposes N
the O
US O
military O
( O
and O
the O
ARVN O
) O
handed O
Johnson H
the O
victory N
he O
had O
ordered O
them O
to O
achieve O
within O
the O
time N
- O
frame O
he O
ordered O
it O
. O

All O
he O
had O
to O
do O
for O
a O
complete O
victory N
was O
allow O
the O
military O
to O
go O
into O
Laos O
and O
Cambodia O
and O
finish O
off O
the O
shattered O
Communist O
forces N
. O

But O
Johnson H
was O
so O
obtuse O
he O
didn’t O
did O
n’t O
understand O
he O
had O
a O
victory N
when O
it O
was O
handed O
to O
him O
on O
a O
silver N
platter N
. O

Instead O
he O
pulled O
the O
military O
off O
, O
stopped O
the O
bombing N
of O
North H
Vietnam O
, O
withdrew O
from O
the O
presidential O
race N
, O
and O
spent O
the O
rest N
of O
his O
term N
in O
office N
trying O
to O
surrender N
to O
North H
Vietnam O
. O

They O
screwed O
up O
by O
not O
accepting O
his O
surrender N
when O
he O
offered O
it O
. O

The O
American O
people N
were O
NOT O
having O
any O
of O
it O
, O
and O
elected O
Richard H
Nixon H
to O
fix O
the O
mess N
LBJ O
had O
made O
( O
not O
to O
surrender N
like O
the O
antiwar O
movement N
was O
demanding O
) O
. O

In O
the O
end N
Nixon H
kept O
his O
promise N
for O
“ O
… O
peace N
with O
honor N
…. O
” O

But O
that’s O
that O
’s H
another O
question N
. O

To O
emancipate O
the O
south O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
serious O
failure N
. O

To O
make O
the O
war N
unpalatable O
to O
the O
American O
public O
. O

In O
that O
, O
they O
pretty O
much O
succeeded O
. O

Before O
Tet O
, O
the O
war N
was O
unpopular O
but O
tolerable O
to O
the O
majority N
of O
Americans O
in O
that O
the O
loss N
of O
American O
lives O
was O
seen O
as O
the O
cost O
of O
subduing O
the O
VC O
and O
NVA O
. O

Tet O
made O
it O
clear N
that O
the O
war N
was O
a O
long O
way N
from O
being O
over O
if O
the O
Americans O
thought O
they O
could O
preserve O
the O
South O
and O
that O
the O
North H
was O
perfectly O
willing O
to O
suffer O
great O
losses N
to O
continue O
their O
fight N
. O

There O
is O
a O
very O
good O
book O
on O
the O
subject O
that O
was O
written O
by O
General O
Vo O
Nguyen O

Bearded O
dragon A
question N
... O
? O

I H
just O
bought O
a O
baby H
one N
yesterday N
. O

I H
have O
a O
basking O
spot N
lamp N
that O
says O
it O
is O
a O
double O
reflector N
that O
focuses O
35 O
% O
more O
light N
/ O
heat N
and O
provides O
beneficial O
UVA O
rays N
important O
to O
the O
psycholical O
well O
- O
being O
of O
him O
. O

My H
question N
is O
does O
that O
mean O
it O
gives O
him O
not O
only O
the O
heat N
, O
but O
the O
" O
sun N
rays N
" O
he O
needs N
? O

I H
also O
was O
wondering O
how O
long O
should O
this O
light N
be O
on O
. O

The O
lady H
at O
pet A
smart O
said O
4 O
hours N
, O
but O
on O
places N
on O
the O
net O
it O
says O
10 O
to O
12 O
hours N
. O

He's O
He O
's H
getting O
used O
to O
his O
new O
home N
, O
but O
hasn't O
has O
n't O
eatin O
yet O
. O

I H
have O
bearded O
dragon A
juvenile H
food N
and O
freeze O
- O
dried O
crickets A
. O

Any O
advice N
would O
be O
greatly O
appreciated O
. O

Thank O
you H
for O
your H
time N
. O

Let O
me H
try O
to O
break O
this O
down O
as O
simply O
as O
I H
can O
: O
diurnal O
( O
active O
during O
the O
day N
time N
) O
reptiles A
like O
the O
bearded O
dragon A
require O
3 O
types N
of O
" O
light N
, O
" O
UVA O
, O
UVB O
, O
and O
heat N
. O

Any O
white O
light N
emitting O
light N
source N
will O
emit O
UVA O
, O
including O
heat N
bulbs N
, O
that's O
that O
's H
the O
easy O
one N
to O
provide O
for O
. O

UVB O
on O
the O
other O
hand N
can O
only O
be O
reproduced O
by O
a O
fluorescent O
source N
. O

UVB O
will O
always O
be O
a O
separate O
bulb N
from O
the O
heat N
lamp N
, O
unless O
you H
use H
a O
MVB O
( O
mercury N
vapor N
bulb N
) O
which O
is O
the O
only O
reptile A
use H
bulb N
that O
will O
emit O
both O
UVB O
and O
heat N
from O
one N
bulb N
. O

I H
highly O
recommend O
that O
you H
do O
not O
use H
coiled O
/ O
compact O
UVB O
bulbs N
as O
they O
are O
known O
to O
cause N
severe O
eye N
damage N
and O
/ O
or O
blindness N
in O
reptiles A
not O
to O
mention N
they O
have O
trouble N
maintaining O
UVB O
output N
over O
time N
. O

The O
long O
tube N
UVB O
bulbs N
are O
best O
, O
like O
Zoomed's O
Zoomed O
's H
Repsitun O
model N
: O
http://lllreptile.com/store/catalog/reptile-supplies/uvb-fluorescent-lights-mercury-vapor-bulbs/-/zoo-med-24-repti-sun-100-fluorescent-bulb/ O
Remember O
to O
replace O
UVB O
bulbs N
according O
to O
the O
manufacturers N
manufacturer N
s H
recommendation N
after O
which O
time N
the O
bulb N
will O
no O
longer O
produce O
UVB O
even O
if O
visible O
light N
still O
is O
. O

So O
, O
to O
answer N
your H
question N
, O
no O
, O
if O
you H
just O
have O
a O
bulb N
that O
says O
it O
produces O
UVA O
then O
you H
do O
not O
have O
" O
the O
sun's O
sun N
's H
rays N
" O
that O
your H
bearded O
needs N
. O

You H
need O
to O
also O
provide O
a O
source N
a O
UVB O
lighting N
. O

The O
person H
at O
Petsmart O
is O
very O
wrong O
; O
in O
fact N
it O
is O
always O
a O
good O
idea N
to O
second N

what O
most O
pet A

employees H
tell O
you H
; O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
best O
track N

regarding O

Freeze O
dried O
food N
is O
not O
a O
good O
staple N

source N
; O
you H
need O
to O
offer O

to O
see O
the O

a O

when O
they O

I H

Yes O
, O
it O

him O
the O
" O
sun N

necessary O
, O
that's O
that O
's H
what O

And O
it O
should O
be O
on O
10 O

just O

As O
for O

just O
be O

to O

Also O
, O

its O
it O

anyone's O
anyone O

he'll O
he O

I H

they O
can O
try O
it O

don't O
do O

They O

the O
same O
noise N
level N
. O

When O
choosing O
a O
parakeet A
look O
for O
a O
young O
one N
. O

( O
the O
younger O
the O
eaiser O
to O
tame O
) O
Look O
for O
clean O
smooth O
feathers N
, O
beak N
, O
and O
clean O
vent N
feathers N
( O
the O
feathers N
around O
the O
butt N
.. O
dirty O
vent N
feathers N
means N
the O
bird A
is O
not O
healthy O
) O
Look O
for O
a O
dark O
eye N
with O
no O
circles O
( O
the O
older O
ones N
have O
a O
circle N
ring N
in O
their O
eyes N
) O
. O

Look O
for O
a O
lot N
of O
stripes N
in O
their O
head N
that O
starts O
from O
the O
beak N
and O
goes O
back O
to O
the O
back O
fo O
the O
bird A
. O

the O
stripes N
are O
like O
hair N
the O
less O
stipes N
the O
older O
. O

( O
think O
of O
a O
balding O
man H
lol O
) O
Look O
for O
clean O
feathers N
. O

If O
you H
want O
a O
boy H
the O
cere N
( O
the O
nostrils N
piece N
above O
the O
beak N
) O
must O
be O
blue O
. O

The O
girl H
has O
either O
pink O
or O
brown O
. O

I H
would O
recommend O
that O
you H
get O
two O
parakeets A
. O

But O
get O
either O
one N
male O
and O
one N
female O
, O
or O
two O
males A
. O

Do O
not O
get O
two O
females H
. O

They O
sometimes O
dont O
do O
nt O
get O
along O
( O
you H
know O
how O
some O
girls H
are O
lol O
hahahaahh O
but O
for O
real O
though O
, O
two O
girls H
tend O
to O
fight N
a O
lot N
. O

I H
have O
one N
yellow O
girl H
and O
a O
green O
and O
yellow O
boy H
. O

They O
are O
the O
best O
! O

If O
you H
choose O
to O
get O
a O
parakeet A
this O
is O
a O
trick N
that O
I H
used O
to O
tame O
them O
. O

However O
if O
you H
plan N
on O
getting O
one N
, O
then O
get O
more O
than O
one N
at O
the O
same O
time N
they O
need O
company N
. O

My H
mom H
told O
me H
how O
to O
tame O
them O
and O
I H
was O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
results N
. O

It O
took O
me H
4 O
days N
to O
get O
the O
new O
one N
to O
be O
able O
to O
step O
on O
and O
eat O
out H
of O
my H
hand N
. O

These O
are O
the O
steps N
I H
used O
. O

Honestly O
they O
have O
worked O
for O
me H
twice O
with O
my H
parakeets A
. O

Hopefully O
they O
will O
work N
for O
you H
. O

1 O
) O
When O
you H
get O
the O
bird A
, O
place N
him O
or O
her O
or O
them O
in O
the O
cage N
. O

Leave O
them O
in O
there O
with O
food N
and O
water N
and O
such O
for O
about O
2 O
hours N
. O

2 O
) O
Then O
place N
you H
hand N
in O
the O
cage N
. O

I H
took O
the O
cage N
and O
place N
it O
next O
to O
the O
couch N
. O

Then O
I H
sat O
on O
the O
couch N
, O
placed O
one N
hand N
in O
the O
cage N
, O
holding O
a O
millet A
spray N
. O

( O
this O
way N
the O
will O
associate O
your H
hand N
with O
food N
, O
and O
birds A
love O
food N
lol O
) O
Then O
I H
turned O
on O
the O
tv N
and O
watch O
. O

This O
way N
they O
will O
see O
that O
your H
hand N
is O
good O
and O
its O
it O
s H
not O
going O
to O
grab O
them O
or O
hurt O
them O
. O

Do O
this O
for O
about O
one N
hour N
. O

( O
you H
can O
take O
breaks O
if O
you H
have O
too O
) O
and O
repeat O
the O
steps N
after O
about O
2 O
hours N
. O

3 O
) O
After O
about O
day N
2 O
, O
they O
will O
start O
to O
eating O
the O
millet A
spray N
from O
your H
hand N
. O

( O
do O
not O
take O
away O
the O
food N
dish N
from O
the O
birds A
, O
they O
will O
associate O
you H
as O
the O
person H
who O
takes O
away O
their O
food N
) O
.... O

Then O
take O
your H
finger N
and O
place N
it O
under O
their O
belly N
, O
in O
front N
of O
their O
feet N
and O
say O
up O
. O

Push O
you H
finger N
to O
their O
feet N
gently O
and O
say O
up O
. O

( O
the O
first O
couple N
of O
times N
they O
will O
fly O
all O
over O
the O
cage N
but O
as O
long O
as O
you H
dont O
do O
nt O
jump N
back O
or O
screem O
they O
will O
get O
used O
to O
you H
) O
They O
will O
have O
no O
choice N
but O
to O
go O
on O
your H
finger N
. O

When O
they O
see O
that O
you H
arnt O
ar O
nt O
harming O
them O
, O
the O
will O
go O
up O
on O
your H
finger N
when O
you H
say O
up O
. O

4 O
) O
If O
they O
are O
not O
going O
up O
by O
now O
you H
just O
gotta O
got O
ta O
keep O
trying O
and O
keep O
trying O
. O

Do O
not O
hit O
, O
yell O
, O
or O
harm O
them O
. O

You H
have O
patience N
. O

Dont O
Do O
nt O
give O
up O
! O

After O
a O
couple N
of O
weeks N
mines H
knows O
when O
I H
say O
shoulder N
it O
means N
ot O
go O
on O
my H
sholder O
, O
when O
I H
say O
up O
it O
means N
to O
jump N
up O
on O
my H
finger N
, O
when O
I H
say O
up O
and O
out H
it O
means N
up O
on O
my H
finger N
and O
out H
of O
the O
cage N
. O

and O
when O
I H
say O
go O
home N
it O
means N
to O
go O
in O
the O
cage N
. O

Good O
luck N
! O

They O
worked O
for O
me H
and O
I H
hope O
they O
worked O
for O
you H
! O

They O
are O
awesome O
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! O

And O
thats O
that O
s H
my H
reason N
why O
you H
should O
choose O
a O
parakeet A
over O
a O
finch A
. O

a O
parakeet A
is O
friendlier O

Parakeet A
. O

They O
are O
normally O
quiet N
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
take O
care N
of O
them O
. O

They O
are O
also O
friendly O
. O

I H
have O
a O
parakeet A
named O
Cookie O
. O
:P O

When O
is O
the O
best O
time N
to O
travel O
to O
Ireland O
? O

My H
sister H
and O
I H
would O
like O
to O
go O
to O
Ireland O
. O

I H
graduate H
in O
the O
spring N
, O
and O
so O
we'd O
we H
'd O
like O
to O
go O
between O
then O
and O
winter N
. O

We H
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
too O
many O
tourists H
, O
and O
since O
we'll O
we H
'll O
both O
be O
out H
of O
school N
we H
can O
go O
anytime O
between O
the O
middle O
of O
June O
to O
early O
November O
. O

We H
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
it O
to O
be O
too O
cold O
( O
not O
sure O
when O
exactly O
there O
fall N
is O
... O
or O
what O
the O
weather N
is O
really O
like O
there O
during O
our H
autumn N
months N
) O
, O
but O
we H
don't O
do O
n't O
feel O
like O
we H
need O
to O
go O
right O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
summer N
either O
. O

We're O
We H
're O
both O
in O
our H
early O
20s N
and O
just O
wanting O
to O
explore O
the O
beautiful O
country N
while O
we're O
we H
're O
still O
young O
and O
before O
our H
lives O
start O
to O
get O
even O
crazier O
! O

Can O
anyone O
give O
me H
an O
idea N
of O
when O
the O
best O
time N
for O
us H
to O
go O
to O
Ireland O
would O
be O
? O

People N
do O
not O
go O
to O
Ireland O
on O
holiday N
for O
the O
weather N
, O
it O
is O
unpredictable O
. O

One O
thing N
you H
can O
be O
sure O
of O
about O
Irish O
weather N
is O
how O
little O
you H
can O
be O
sure O
of O
. O

It O
may O
be O
shirtsleeves N
and O
sunglasses N
in O
February O
, O
but O
winter N
woollies O
in O
March O
and O
even O
during O
the O
summer N
. O

And O
then O
there’s O
there O
’s H
the O
rain N
. O

Ireland O
receives O
a O
lot N
of O
rain N
, O
with O
certain O
areas N
getting O
a O
soaking N
as O
many O
as O
270 O
days N
of O
the O
year N
. O

County O
Kerry H
is O
the O
worst O
affected O
. O

The O
southeast O
is O
the O
driest O
, O
enjoying O
a O
more O
continental O
climate N
. O

The O
Irish O
weather N
works O
on O
the O
‘ O
four O
seasons N
in O
a O
day N
’ O
principle N
, O
which O
basic­ally O
means N
that O
you H
can’t O
ca O
n’t O
predict O
a O
thing N
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
behaviour N
of O
the O
sky O
. O

Some O
basic O
assumptions N
, O
however O
, O
can O
be O
made O
. O

In O
summer N
, O
from O
May O
to O
July O
, O
the O
days N
are O
reasonably O
warm O
and O
– O
most O
importantly O
– O
very O
long O
: O
at O
the O
height N
of O
summer N
you H
won’t O
wo O
n’t O
need O
to O
turn O
on O
lights N
until O
after O
10 O
pm O
. O

It O
is O
also O
peak N
tourist H
season N
, O
which O
means N
there O
are O
far O
more O
people N
just O
about O
everywhere O
but O
the O
most O
remote O
corners N
of O
the O
island N
, O
and O
prices N
are O
at O
their O
highest O
. O

Not O
surprisingly O
, O
most O
of O
the O
yearly O
festivals N
occur O
during O
these O
times N
so O
as O
to O
take O
advantage N
of O
the O
crowds N
and O
the O
more O
favourable O
weather N
. O

Spring N
( O
February O
to O
April O
) O
and O
Autumn O
( O
August O
to O
October O
) O
make O
good O
alternatives N
, O
although O
the O
country’s O
country N
’s H
ever O
- O
growing O
popularity N
as O
a O
tourist H
destination N
can O
often O
blur O
the O
lines N
between O
mid O
- O
and O
high O
- O
season N
tourism N
. O

Still O
, O
you H
have O
a O
better O
chance N
of O
some O
peace N
and O
quiet N
, O
and O
the O
weather N
can O
be O
surprisingly O
better O
in O
April O
and O
September O
than O
in O
mid-July O
– O
again O
, O
it’s O
it O
’s H
all O
part N
of O
the O
uncertainty N
principle N
. O

Spring N
festivities N
include O
the O
ever O
- O
popular O
St H
Patrick’s O
Patrick H
’s H
Festival O
. O

Although O
temperatures N
do O
not O
often O
venture N
below O
freezing N
, O
winter N
( O
December O
to O
February O
) O
can O
be O
brutal O
, O
for O
huge O
parts N
of O
the O
country N
– O
the O
west O
and O
northwest N
in O
particular O
. O

Crowds N
are O
at O
their O
thinnest O
, O
but O
many O
of O
the O
country’s O
country N
’s H
tourist H
attractions N
and O
services N
close O
down O
in O
October O
and O
don’t O
do O
n’t O
reopen O
until O
Easter O
, O
which O
paradoxically O
leaves N
visitors H
with O
a O
more O
convincing O
taste N
of O
how O
Ireland O
is O
experienced O
by O
most O
of O
the O
Irish O
: O
it’s O
it O
’s H
cold O
, O
grey O
and O
dark O
by O
5 O
pm O
, O
but O
there’s O
there O
’s H
always O
a O
pub N
to O
escape O
into O
when O
the O
rain N
starts O
sheeting O
down O
. O

The O
thing N
to O
do O
is O
to O
bring O
the O
right O
clothing N
with O
you H
, O
clothes N
so O
you H
can O
layer O
up O
if O
it O
is O
cold O
and O
take O
off O
layers N
when O
it O
warms O
up O
. O

Waterproof O
clothing N
and O
footwear N
are O
essential O
plus O
an O
umbrella N
.. O

As O
that O
famous O
Scotsman O
Billy H
Connolly H
says O
" O
there O
is O
no O
such O
thing N
as O
bad O
weather N
just O
the O
wrong O
clothes N
" O

Afraid O
I H
cannot O
can O
not O
be O
more O
helpful O
, O
it O
is O
really O
a O
case N
of O
pot N
luck N
, O
although O
as O
the O
weather N
is O
so O
changeable O
often O
a O
cold O
wet O
morning N
will O
turn O
into O
a O
lovely O
warm O
sunny O
afternoon N
and O
evening N
or O
visa N
versa O
. O

If O
you H
mean O
the O
Republic O
of O
Ireland O
( O
Dublin O
) O
then O
anytime O
. O

The O
summer N
there O
is O
much O
more O
mild O
than O
most O
of O
the O
US O
( O
are O
you H
coming O
from O
the O
US O
? O
) O
. O

Their O
seasons N
are O
the O
same O
as O
all O
the O
countries N
in O
the O
Northern O
Hemisphere O
but O
I H
would O
suggest O
fall N
. O

It O
does O
get O
pretty O
cold O
in O
Ireland O
so O
going O
before O
winter N
is O
your H
best O
bet N
. O

September O
for O
example N
. O

Rent O
a O
car N
and O
spend O
a O
couple N
days N
outside O
of O
Dublin O
seeing O
the O
countryside N
and O
you H
will O
have O
the O
trip N
of O
a O
lifetime N
. O

To O
explore O
the O
beautiful O
countryside N
you H
will O
need O
to O
be O
old O
enough O
to O
hire O
a O
car N
because O
public O
transport N
is O
expensive O
& O
only O
goes O
as O
far O
as O
the O
main O
towns N
/ O
cities N
, O
most O
rural O
places N
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
bus N
or O
train N
service N
. O

You H
could O
stay O
in O
a O
city N
& O
get O
a O
bus N
tour N
to O
say O
the O
Cliffs O
of O
Moher O
or O
Dingle O
peninsula N
but O
you H
will O
be O
with O
all O
the O
other O
tourists H
. O

By O
definition N
most O
tourists H
will O
go O
to O
the O
best O
places N
so O
you H
might O
have O
to O
put O
up O
with O
a O
few O
tourists H
along O
the O
way N
. O

Best O
weather N
the O
past N
couple N
of O
years N
has O
been O
around O
late O
April O
- O
late O
May O
but O
it O
can O
pour O
with O
rain N
for O
days N
on O
end N
at O
any O
time N
of O
the O
year N
so O
be O
prepared O
with O
waterproof O
jackets N
/ O
boots N
etc O
. O

We H
only O
had O
a O
few O
sunny O
days N
this O
summer N
, O
barely O
24 O
C N
on O
a O
few O
occasions N
, O
more O
like O
14 O
C N
most O
days N
. O

We H
used O
our H
BBQ O
on O
precisely O
4 O
occasions N
. O

Autumn O
is O
from O
mid O
August O
onwards O
as O
far O
as O
the O
weather N
goes O
if O
not O
officially O
according O
to O
the O
calender N
. O

The O
days N
start O
to O
shorten O
& O
it O
gets O
even O
wetter O
, O
windier O
& O
colder O
. O

We H
had O
frosts N
in O
October O
so O
I H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
advise O
visiting O
late O
in O
the O
year N
to O
be O
honest O
, O
Spring N
time N
is O
your H
best O
bet N
. O

You H
do O
realise O
it O
is O
quite O
expensive O
to O
visit O
Ireland O
? O

You H
are O
going O
to O
need O
a O
few O
thousand O
dollars N
saved O
up O
for O
flights N
, O
insurance N
, O
food N
, O
accommodation N
& O
spending N
money N
. O

Eating O
out H
in O
particular O
is O
quite O
expensive O
compared O
to O
America O
I H
believe O
. O

Golden O

? O

I H
have O
4 O
Golden O
Wonder N
Killifish A
. O

1 O

really O
colorful O
and O

2 O
of O
them O
are O

whitish O
and O
are O

4 O

5 O
cm N
long O
. O

The O
last O
one N
is O
colourful O
too O
but O
it O

4 O
cm N
long O
. O

I H

and O
Live O
Earthworms A

of O
the O

? O

Thanks N
in O

Wow O
! O

If O
they O
are O
able O
to O
take O
earthworms A
uncut O
, O
that O
is O
really O
impressive O
! O

I H
aspire O
to O
your H
feeding O
regime N
, O
flakes N
early O
and O
something O
live O
later O
in O
the O
day N
. O

Worms A
( O
and O
Daphnia A
) O
are O
also O
rich O
in O
Lipids N
, O
substances N
important O
in O
forming O
eggs N
and O
growing O
young O
. O

I H
think O
that O
you H
understand O
that O
your H
largest O
and O
smallest O
golden O
wonders N
are O
males A
. O

If O
you H
would O
like O
more O
on O
sexing O
out H
Aplocheilus O
lineatus O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
discussion N
in O
the O
first O
source N
below O
. O

If O
you H
have O
plants A
in O
your H
tank N
. O

your H
lineatus O
are O
already O
spawning O
. O

If O
conditions N
are O
favorable O
( O
78 O
- O
82 O
F O
) O
and O
the O
fish A
are O
obviously O
well O
fed O
as O
yours H
are O
, O
they O
will O
spawn O
. O

( O
I've O
I H
've O
even O
had O
a O
pair N
of O
killies O
leave O
eggs N
on O
a O
floating O
thermometer N
! O

If O
you H
wish O
to O
pick O
eggs N
make O
a O
acrylic O
spawning O
mop N
. O

Check O
out H
the O
second N
source N
. O

I H
prefer O
darker O
colors N
because O
I H
can O
see O
their O
eggs N
, O
more O
easily O
and O
the O
fish A
look O
better O
next O
to O
them O
. O

Use O
a O
well O
rinsed O
medicine N
vial N
, O
a O
cork N
, O
new O
fishing N
bobber N
or O
even O
a O
piece N
of O
non-crumbly O
styrofoam N
to O
float O
them O
. O

There O
are O
a O
couple N
ways N
one N
could O
spawn O
lineatus O
- O
mop N
spawning O
& O
water N
incubating O
them O
for O
two O
weeks N
, O
picking O
eggs N
from O
a O
mop N
& O
putting O
them O
in O
a O
tray N
of O
treated O
, O
seasoned O
water N
or O
setting N
up O
the O
parents H
in O
a O
planted O
tank N
& O
moving O
them O
so O
the O
fry H
can O
hatch O
out H
there O
. O

If O
you H
have O
the O
room N
to O
separate O
the O
male O
( O
s H
) O
& O
females H
( O
s H
) O
, O
& O
feed O
them O
well O
on O
live O
foods N
, O
( O
assuming O
that O
you H
are O
doing O
weekly O
50 O
% O
water N
changes N
) O
when O
you H
put O
them O
together O
they O
will O
leave O
a O
lot N
more O
eggs N
. O

Just O
making O
up O
examples N
, O
but O
if O
a O
pair N
is O
constantly O
together O
, O
they O
may O
lay O
10 O
- O
15 O
eggs N
a O
day N
. O

With O
extra O
blackworms O
and O
maybe O
frozen O
( O
defrosted O
, O
rinsed O
) O
frozen O
foods N
earlier O
in O
the O
day N
, O
they O
may O
leave O
30 O
- O
40 O
eggs N
at O
a O
time N
. O

Separated O
and O
feed O
extremely O
nourishing O
stuff N
, O
they O
may O
produce O
more O
. O

Separating O
a O
pair N
some O
time N
before O
a O
show O
( O
killies O
are O
usually O
shown O
& O
judged O
& O
often O
sold O
as O
pairs N
) O
will O
encourage O
them O
to O
court N
and O
show O
their O
best O
colors N
. O

They O
also O
start O
the O
day N
with O
no O
nicks N
or O
dings N
in O
their O
fins N
. O

The O
water N
changes N
help O
with O
that O
too O
. O

You H
also O
may O
need O
to O
treat O
the O
incubation N
water N
. O

The O
chlorine N
and O
ammonia N
( O
choramine O
) O
are O
not O
good O
for O
the O
eggs N
. O

Ironically O
sometimes O
it O
is O
wise O
to O
leave O
the O
newly O
picked O
eggs N
in O
fresh O
tap O
water N
with O
some O
chlorination N
to O
kill O
microscopic O
critters A
that O
ride O
in O
with O
the O
eggs N
. O

THEN O
put O
the O
eggs N
in O
water N
treated O
a O
couple N
of O
days N
before O
with O
a O
water N
treatment N
and O
left O
open O
to O
" O
breathe O
" O
. O

Leaving O
a O

with O
a O

in O
it O
will O
sate O
the O
adult's O
adult O
's H
desire N
for O
snacks N
and O
they O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
leave O

or O
eggs N
alone O
. O

If O
a O

isn't O
is O
n't O
leaving O
eggs N
... O
check O
the O
following O
: O

1 O

Aplo. O

That O
indicates O
that O
they O
thrive O
in O
different O

Still O
if O
you H
can O
get O
your H
pet A
shop N
to O
do O
a O
hardness N
or O
TDS O
( O

that O
may O
give O

a O

Winging O

a O

They O
include O
a O

you H

what O
percentage N
of O
that O
would O

there O
is O
a O

that O
can O
break O
down O
the O

around O
the O
egg A
and O
allow O
critters A
to O
get O
in O
and O
eat O
the O
yoke N
and O
embryo A
. O
) O

Ironically O
sometimes O
it O
is O
wise O
to O
newly O
picked O
eggs N
in O
fresh O
tap O
water N
with O
some O
chlorination N
to O
kill O
microscopic O
critters A
that O
ride O

with O
the O
eggs N

THEN O
put O
the O
eggs N
in O
water N
treated O
a O
couple N
of O
days N
before O
with O
a O
water N
treatment N
and O
left O
open O
to O
" O
breathe O
" O
. O

If O
you H
get O
eggs N
in O
the O
mail N
in O
a O
medicine N
vial N
, O
that O
is O
fine O
. O

But O
get O
the O
eggs N
out H
, O
maybe O
rinsed O
in O
fresh O
tap O
water N
and O
then O
into O
the O
incubation N
water N
. O

In O
time N
the O
eggs N
can O
suffocate O
in O
the O
shipping N
container N
. O

After O
a O
number N
of O
people N
began O
complaining O
about O
" O
mystery N
deaths N
" O
among O
incubating O
eggs N
, O
some O
of O
the O
more O
advanced O
killie O
people N
began O
suggesting O
that O
after O
7 O
- O
8 O
days N
of O
incubation N
, O
one N
should O
do O
a O
100 O
% O
water N
change O
- O
as O
the O
eggs N
develop O
, O
they O
do O
release N
waste O
material O
. O

Another O
problem N
is O
that O
sometimes O
bad O
eggs N
will O
fungus A
and O
the O
fungus A
will O
spread O
out H
and O
kill O
all O
the O
eggs N
. O

Some O
people N
put O
in O
a O
very O
dilute O
Acriflaven O
solution N
to O
slow O
down O
the O
fungus A
, O
so O
one N
can O
take O
white O
eggs N
out H
with O
a O
pipette N
or O
eyedropper O
. O

Other O
will O
add O
a O
drop O
of O
Methylene O
blue O
. O

If O
an O
egg A
turns N
blue O
, O
it O
had O
died O
and O
then O
became O
dyed O
as O
the O
outer O
membrane N
broke O
down O
. O

Get O
those O
out H
ASAP O
too O
. O

Hope H
there O
is O
useful O
grist N
for O
the O
mill N
here O
. O

. O

cartoons N
will O
impress O
only O

........ O

Off O
season N
is O
good O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Disney O
cruises N
are O
almost O
ALWAYS O
completely O
booked O
. O

I H
would O
suggest O
a O
warmer O
season N
, O
but O
not O
Spring N
Break N
or O
early O
summer N
. O

You H
may O
also O
want O
to O
avoid O
Thanksgiving O
week N
and O
the O
Christmas O
holidays N
. O

We H
REALLY O
enjoyed O
our H
balcony N
-- O
coffee N
in O
the O
mornings N
, O
drinks N
at O
night N
, O
standing N
outside O
when O
docking O
and O
leaving O
port N
-- O
however O
, O
it O
is O
quite O
a O
bit N
more O
expensive O
. O

With O
young O
ones N
, O
I H
would O
definitely O
get O
a O
window N
or O
view N
room N
so O
they O
can O
see O
outside O
. O

Check O
out H
the O
kids' O
kids H
' O
space N
as O
soon O
as O
you H
get O
onboard O
. O

Do O
NOT O
feel O
guilty O
about O
taking O
them O
there O
. O

They O
have O
a O
BLAST N
so O
the O
sooner O
they O
get O
there O
, O
the O
sooner O
they O
can O
have O
fun O
. O

We H
liked O
getting O
the O
late O
dinner N
seating N
, O
so O
you H
have O
more O
time N
to O
see O
movies N
and O
stuff N
but O
if O
your H
kids H
are O
' O
early O
to O
bed N
' O
you H
may O
want O
the O
earlier O
seating N
for O
dinners N
. O

Bring O
some O
sort N
of O
magnet N
or O
small O
magnetic O
whiteboard O
for O
your H
door N
. O

All O
of O
the O
doors N
tend O
to O
look O
alike O
and O
having O
' O
something O
' O
on O
your H
door N
helps O
you H
and O
your H
kids H
find O
your H
room N
easier O
. O

You H
can O
also O
leave O
notes N
for O
the O
rest N
of O
your H
family H
( O
husband H
) O
about O
where O
you H
are O
at O
any O
given O
point N
. O

Cell N
phones N
do O
NOT O
work N
on O
board N
but O
they O
give O
you H
a O
' O
walkie O
- O
talkie N
' O
kind N
of O
phone N
in O
your H
room N
that O
WILL O
work N
onboard O
. O

Each O
evening N
you H
will O
get O
a O
' O
magazine N
' O
called O
The O
Navigator O
which O
lists O
all O
of O
the O
activities N
for O
the O
next O
day N
. O

We H
always O
took O
ours H
to O
dinner N
and O
discussed O
what O
things N
we H
felt N
we H
' O
had O
' O
to O
do O
and O
which O
ones N
we H
felt N
like O
skipping O
in O
lieu N
of O
just O
chilling O
. O

Any O
time N
would O
be O
great O
. O

off O
season N
cruises N
might O
actually O
be O
better O
with O
preschoolers H
as O
prices N
might O
be O
lower O
in O
the O
off O
season N
. O

My H
wife H
and O
I H
, O
in O
our H
60's N
at O
the O
time N
, O
originally O
planned O
a O
3 O
generation N
trip N
but O
some O
family H
emergencies N
caused O
everyone O
else O
to O
cancel O
. O

We H
had O
a O
ball N
. O

We H
had O
an O
inside O
cabin N
and O
it O
is O
what O
I H
would O
recommend O
. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
things N
to O
do O
that O
you H
will O
only O
use H
your H
room N
for O
sleeping O
and O
the O
extra O
cost O
of O
the O
balcony N
is O
wasted O
. O

The O
children H
can O
be O
checked O
in O
and O
checked O
out H
in O
a O
safe O
way N
at O
many O
activities N
so O
you H
can O
have O
a O
bit N
of O
free O
time N
without O
the O
little O
ones N
. O

The O
range N
of O
activities N
can O
be O
illustrated O
by O
describing O
the O
water N
activities N
. O

There O
is O
a O
splash N
fountain N
( O
no O
standing N
water N
) O
for O
little O
ones N
still O
in O
diapers N
; O
Next O
is O
a O
wading N
pool N
for O
those O
who O
are O
potty N
trained O
; O
Then O
a O
family H
pool N
; O
Finally O
there O
is O
a O
pool N
for O
adults H
only O
with O
kids H
not O
allowed O
. O

You H
will O
never O
be O
so O
spoiled O
in O
your H
life N
as O
you H
are O
on O
a O
Disney O
Cruise O
. O

If O
you H
stay O
with O
your H
dining N
schedule N
, O
every O
night N
is O
dinner N
and O
a O
show O
. O

The O
real O
payoff N
is O
that O
you H
will O
have O
the O
same O
waiter H
for O
the O
entire O
cruise N
. O

Our H
waiter H
quickly O
grasped O
the O
fact N
that O
I H
like O
Ginger H
ale N
and O
rather O
spicy O
foods N
while O
my H
wife's O
wife H
's H
taste N
ran O
to O
lemonade N
and O
less O
spicy O
fare N
. O

Since O
they O
knew O
our H
preferences N
, O
we H
almost O
always O
went O
along O
with O
their O
menu N
suggestions N
and O
were O
never O
sorry O
we H
did O
. O

Obviously O
they O
had O
a O
full O
beverage N
list N
including O
alcohol N
for O
adults H
who O
wanted O
it O
. O

If O
you H
should O
miss O
a O
meal N
, O
you H
also O
missed O
a O
great O
show O
. O

but O
food N
is O
always O
available O
and O
it O
is O
consistently O
good O
. O

I H
think O
I H
gained O
three O
pounds N
in O
my H
week N
long O
cruise N
. O

This O
is O
about O
my H
farrier H
, O
girls H
. O

That's O
That O
's H
why O
I'm O
I H
'm O
posting N
here O
! O

Help N
? O

I H
posted O
this O
in O
singles N
and O
dating O
too O
, O
so O
I've O
I H
've O
just O
copied O
and O
pasted O
. O

Well O
, O
I'll O
I H
'll O
try O
to O
make O
this O
short O
. O

I H
have O
known O
this O
guy H
for O
a O
long O
time N
, O
but O
we've O
we H
've O
never O
been O
good O
friends H
or O
anything O
. O

He O
is O
my H
farrier H
( O
shoes N
my H
horses A
horse A
s H
feet N
) O
so O
I H
am O
technically O
a O
client H
if O
you H
want O
to O
view N
it O
that O
way N
. O

Well O
, O
almost O
two O
weeks N
ago O
he O
came O
out H
and O
did O
my H
horses A
horse A
s H
feet N
and O
was O
SO O
flirty O
. O

He O
always O
hugs N
me H
when O
he O
comes O
, O
but O
he O
gave O
me H
at O
least O
5 O
tight O
, O
long O
, O
back O
rubbing O
hugs N
while O
he O
was O
there O
. O

We H
were O
also O
just O
talking O
about O
my H
horse's O
horse A
's H
crappy O
feet N
and O
he O
mentioned O
. O

" O
Well O
, O
if O
you H
ever O
just O
want O
to O
see O
me H
I'll O
I H
'll O
come O
out H
and O
look O
him O
over O
and O
then O
we H
can O
grab O
a O
coffee N
after O
. O
" O

That O
has O
NEVER O
happened O
before O
so O
I H
was O
kinda O
realizing O
at O
that O
point N
that O
he O
was O
a O
little O
interested O
. O

Right O
?? O

Anyway O
, O
so O
he O
ended O
up O
leaving O
one N
nail N
out H
of O
my H
horses A
horse A
s H
foot N
( O
I've O
I H
've O
never O
heard O
of O
a O
farrier H
doing O
this O
) O
and O
telling O
me H
to O
call O
him O
in O
a O
few O
days N
( O
first O
it O
was O
a O
week N
, O
then O
it O
was O
a O
few O
days N
lol O
) O
and O
he'd O
he O
'd O
come O
back O
out H
and O
put O
it O
in O
. O

He O
told O
me H
to O
remember O
to O
call O
like O
3 O
times N
before O
he O
left O
. O

So O
, O
I H
waited O
a O
week N
to O
call O
because O
I H
was O
busy O
and O
I H
wanted O
to O
have O
him O
come O
out H
on O
a O
day N
when O
I H
am O
more O
available O
in O
case N
we H
were O
to O
hang O
out H
after O
;) O

Anyway O
, O
so O
that O
was O
2 O
days N
ago O
that O
I H
called O
and O
left O
a O
message N
, O
but O
he O
still O
hasn't O
has O
n't O
called O
back O
yet O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
I H
should O
call O
him O
again O
tomorrow N
or O
not O
? O

I H
know O
a O
lot N
of O
people N
say O
to O
wait N
until O
he O
calls O
you H
, O
but O
it's O
it O
's H
different O
because O
I'm O
I H
'm O
a O
client H
and O
technically O
that's O
that O
's H
all O
I H
am O
at O
this O
point N
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand N
though O
, O
if O
I'm O
I H
'm O
a O
client H
he O
should O
really O
of O
called O
back O
by O
now O
because O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
leave O
a O
customer H
hanging O
. O

He O
didn't O
did O
n't O
have O
my H
number N
either O
because O
this O
was O
the O
first O
time N
I've O
I H
've O
called O
HIM O
instead O
of O
his O
dad H
. O

It's O
It O
's H
a O
father H
and O
son H
business N
. O

Anyway O
, O
I H
would O
appreciate O
ANY O
insight N
on O
this O
at O
all O
. O

Thank O
you H
for O
reading O
if O
you H
did O
! O
:) O

Ok O
, O
well O
as O
far O
as O
him O
being O
a O
bad O
farrier H
for O
leaving O
a O
nail N
out H
- O
That O
is O
not O
the O
case N
, O
they O
are O
extremely O
well O
known O
farriers H
in O
the O
area N
. O

I H
would O
be O
a O
lot N
more O
concerned O
if O
the O
shoe N
fell O
off O
because O
it O
was O
missing O
one N
lousy O
nail N
. O

The O
reason N
he O
said O
he O
didn't O
did O
n't O
put O
that O
nail N
in O
was O
because O
he O
" O
didn't O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
risk N
it O
" O
with O
my H
horse's O
horse A
's H
horrible O
feet N
. O

This O
is O
about O
the O
fourth O
time N
they've O
they O
've O
done O
my H
horse's O
horse A
's H
feet N
because O
I H
just O
switched O
back O
to O
them O
. O

The O
only O
reason N
I H
switched O
away O
from O
them O
in O
the O
first O
place N
is O
because O
my H
good O
friend H
who O
apprenticed O
with O
them O
was O
starting O
out H
on O
his O
own O
. O

However O
, O
he O
left O
my H
horse A
without O
a O
shoe N
for O
TWO O
WEEKS N
( O
now O
that's O
that O
's H
what O
I H
call O
a O
crap N
farrier H
) O
. O

Which O
, O
I H
might O
add O
is O
the O
same O
foot N
that O
keeps O
crumbling O
with O
the O
nails N
. O

So O
, O
obviously O
I H
switched O
back O
to O
these O
guys H
. O

Ok O
, O
calm O
down O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
like O
he's O
he O
's H
some O
stranger H
that O
came O
up O
and O
groped O
me H
lol O
. O

I've O
I H
've O
known O
the O
guy H
for O
about O
10 O
years N
. O

I H
am O
21 O
, O
so O
yeah O
we H
were O
both O
kids H
when O
we H
knew O
each O
other O
! O

He O
is O
a O
few O
years N
older O
than O
me H
. O

And O
yes O
, O
I H
do O
like O
him O
. O

To O
answer N
Barry H
White H
, O
yes O
that O
did O
occur O
to O
me H
:) O
I H
hope O
that O
is O
all O
he's O
he O
's H
waiting O
for O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand N
, O
he O
could O
very O
easily O
just O
call O
me H
and O
say O
hey O
I'm O
I H
'm O
busy O
right O
now O
, O
I'll O
I H
'll O
call O
you H
when O
I H
can O
come O
out H
. O

And O
as O
far O
as O
scheduled O
visits N
go O
, O
I H
have O
no O
idea N
. O

I've O
I H
've O
never O
done O
that O
before O
though O
either O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
always O
just O
" O
Okay O
, O
they're O
feet N
need O
to O
be O
done O
, O
better O
call O
the O
farrier H
. O
" O

And O
they O
usually O
come O
out H
within O
a O
few O
days N
. O

He O
will O
call O
you H
back O
Im O
I H
m O
sure O
! O

Sounds O
like O
He O
really O
likes O
you H
.. O

But O
you H
need O
to O
ask O
yourself H
do O
you H
feel O
the O
same O
way N
? O

would O
You H
like O
going O
for O
* O
coffee N
* O
with O
him O
? O

or O
is O
he O
Not O
your H
type N
? O

Or O
are O
you H
undecided O
? O

If O
i H
were O
you H
I H
would O
Go O
... O

I H
would O
say O
if O
he O
does O
not O
call O
you H
back O
by O
friday O
call O
him O
again O
he O
could O
be O
playing O
hard O
to O
get O
? O

I H
think O
he O
left O
the O
Nail N
out H
of O
the O
shoe N
as O
a O
excuse O
to O
come O
back O
and O
see O
you H
hey O
he O
may O
be O
your H
Prince H
charming O
.. O

Edit O
... O
I H
really O
dont O
do O
nt O
think O
Your H
horse A
Is O
in O
danger N
Of O
being O
hurt O
With O
one N
Nail N
missing O
.. O

I H
have O
seen O
horses A
Loose O
Nails O
On O
there O
Own O
And O
do O
just O
fine O
with O
ONE O
nail N
gone O
Now O
if O
he O
had O
left O
out H
2 O
or O
3 O
I H
would O
be O
wondering O
to O
... O

I H
really O
do O
belive O
he O
left O
the O
nail N
out H
becuse O
of O
the O
horses A
horse A
s H
Hoof N
condition N
and O
Its O
It O
s H
a O
added O
bonus N
he O
would O
get O
to O
see O
her O
again O

When O
I H
was O
Younger O
In O
my H
early O
20s N
My H
farrier H
was O
A H
hottie O
named O
Joby O
.. O
( O
for O
those O
who O
don't O
do O
n't O
Know O
I H
AM O
A H
GIRL H
read O
my H
Bio O
on O
my H
Page H
) O
dumb O
as O
a O
post N
about O
everything O
But O
horses A
.. O

He O
was O
In O
his O
30s N
divorced O
and O
Had O
2 O
kids H
.. O
but O
we H
both O
flirted O
Horribly O
with O
each O
other O
.. O
but O
neither O
one N
of O
us H
took O
the O
chance N
and O
Asked O
to O
other O
on O
a O
date N
. O
:( O

sorta O
sort N
a O
wonder O
what O
it O
would O
have O
been O
like O
? O

But O
That O
was O
Years N
ago O
. O

He O
had O
this O
Habit N
of O
telling O
you H
Everything O
.. O

Well O
one N
day N
he O
said O
to O
me H
You H
know O
i H
don't O
do O
n't O
wear O
Underwear N
as O
he O
was O
bent O
over O
Working O
on O
my H
Mares O
Mare A
s H
Right O
front N
hoof N
.. O
and O
I H
was O
Like O
Ummmm O
okay O
??? O

Im O
I H
m O
glad O
his O
butt N
was O
facing O
me H
so O
he O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
see O
my H
red O
face N
I H
think O
my H
Mare A
was O
even O
laughing O
.. O

Well O
6 O
weeks N
Later O
when O
he O
came O
back O
out H
He O
was O
again O
working O
on O
my H
mares O
mare A
s H
front N
Foot O
and O
I H
looked O
Down O
and O
Yeah O
he O
had O
Wholes N
In O
his O
pants N
In O
the O
wrong O
places N
I H
bust N
out H
Laughing O
and O
He O
was O
like O
what O
??? O

I H
was O
like O
Ummmm O
i H
can O
see O
your H
ass N
cheeks N
... O
he O
was O
like O
Oops O
did O
i H
forget O
my H
Underwear N
??? O

that O
was O
a O
strange O
way N
to O
flirt O
.. O
but O
i H
guss O
it O
was O
his O
way N
... O

But O
like O
i H
said O
nothing N
ever O
came O
of O
It O
.. O
the O
next O
time N
I H
saw O
him O
He O
had O
told O
Me H
he O
had O
To O
get O
married O
to O
a O
girl H
Who O
he O
worked O
with O
becuse O
he O
knocked O
Her O
Up O
.. O

I H
was O
heartbroken O
.. O
but O
then O
realized O
He O
was O
not O
the O
Guy H
for O
me H
.. O

Wow O
he O
does O
sound N
interested O
in O
you H
, O
my H
farrier H
never O
gives O
me H
hugs N
like O
that O
( O
probably O
a O
good O
thing N
as O
he O
has O
a O
wife H
and O
2 O
kids H
) O
anyway O
, O
I H
find O
that O
they O
can O
be O
very O
busy O
so O
I H
would O
wait N
a O
week N
lo9nger O
and O
if O
still O
no O
reply O
give O
him O
a O
call O
but O
don’t O
do O
n’t O
leave O
a O
message N
so O
you H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
have O
to O
necessarily O
wait N
for O
him O
to O
call O
. O

From O
the O
point N
of O
view N
of O
a O
business N
, O
and O
client H
/ O
operator N
relationships N
, O
he's O
he O
's H
doing O
a O
really O
shitty O
job N
. O

Leaving O
nails N
out H
so O
you'll O
you H
'll O
call O
and O
have O
him O
come O
back O
out H
later O
? O

Cute O
or O
not O
, O
I'd O
I H
'd O
call O
a O
different O
bloke H
because O
he's O
he O
's H
doing O
a O
sub-par O
job N
at O
something O
he O
needs N
to O
be O
doing O
his O
best O
at O
, O
whether O
he's O
he O
's H
flirting N
or O
trying O
to O
ask O
you H
out H
or O
not O
, O
he O
ought O
to O
put O
quality N
first O
. O

This O
is O
, O
after O
all O
, O
his O
business N
, O
and O
if O
he O
wants O
you H
to O
remain O
a O
customer H
why O
on O
earth N
is O
he O
doing O
shoddy O
work N
? O

EPM O
, O
Anyone O
Dealt O
with O
it O
? O

Might O
be O
something O
different O
? O

I H
have O
the O
opportunity N
to O
pick O
up O
a O
super O
nice O
6 O
year N
old O
for O
free O
. O

He's O
He O
's H
not O
lame O
, O
but O
he's O
he O
's H
been O
having O
issues N
. O

Here's O
Here O
's H
what O
the O
owner H
has O
said O
: O

I H
have O
a O
5 O
year N
old O
that O
lost O
all O
of O
his O
cheek N
muscle N
on O
the O
right O
side N
about O
3 O
- O
4 O
months N
ago O
. O

I H
chalked O
it O
up O
to O
possible O
nerve N
damage N
, O
because O
this O
is O
what O
the O
vet H
thought O
and O
the O
other O
cheek N
muscle N
was O
fine O
and O
he O
had O
no O
theeth N
problems N
. O

So O
I H
sent O
him O
to O
the O
trainers H
the O
first O
of O
September O
to O
be O
started O
on O
the O
barrels N
. O

I H
got O
him O
back O
the O
first O
of O
the O
month N
and O
he O
had O
lost O
some O
weight N
but O
attributed O
that O
to O
be O
worked O
everyday O
( O
I H
expected O
him O
to O
drop O
some O
) O
. O

He O
is O
now O
losing O
the O
cheek N
muscle N
on O
the O
left O
side N
of O
his O
face N
and O
seems O
to O
be O
dropping O
weight N
by O
the O
day N
. O

Had O
him O
to O
a O
dentist H
yesterday N
and O
there O
is O
no O
teeth N
problems N
. O

He O
can O
eat O
all O
his O
feed O
and O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
drop O
any O
, O
but O
cannot O
can O
not O
eat O
hay N
from O
lack N
of O
muscle N
to O
chew O
it O
. O

He O
is O
gant O
looking O
in O
his O
flank N
area N
and O
is O
losing O
topline O
muscle N
. O

The O
only O
neurological O
sign N
that O
he O
shows N
is O
that O
he O
barely O
drags O
his O
toes N
and O
sometimes O
has O
trouble N
with O
his O
right O
lead O
. O

The O
horse A
I H
had O
posted O
about O
a O
couple N
weeks N
ago O
with O
the O
atrophied O
cheek N
muscles N
is O
down O
to O
his O
last O
resort N
for O
life N
. O

I H
CANNOT O
CAN O
NOT O
afford O
to O
treat O
whatever O
is O
wrong O
with O
him O
. O

NO O
, O
I H
have O
not O
done O
an O
EPM O
test N
but O
have O
done O
an O
extensive O
blood N
panel N
and O
my H
vet H
did O
a O
neurological O
physical O
exam N
. O

We H
elected O
to O
not O
do O
the O
EPM O
test N
because O
there O
was O
NO O
neurological O
signs N
. O

He O
is O
still O
showing O
no O
signs N
other O
than O
the O
weight N
loss N
, O
and O
some O
muscle N
atrophy N
. O

He O
eats O
all O
of O
his O
grain N
but O
it O
just O
takes O
him O
a O
while O
to O
get O
it O
chewed O
because O
of O
the O
lack N
of O
muscle N
in O
his O
jaws N
. O

So O
I H
might O
get O
the O
horse A
and O
see O
what O
I H
can O
do O
. O

I H
will O
be O
getting O
with O
my H
vet H
first O
and O
if O
I H
do O
get O
him O
, O
have O
the O
spinal O
fluid O
test N
done O
for O
EPM O
and O
a O
titer N
test N
. O

Will O
be O
getting O
a O
copy N
of O
the O
blood N
results N
the O
owner H
has O
already O
ran O
as O
well O
. O

My H
other O
theory N
would O
be O
wobblers N
. O

I'll O
I H
'll O
be O
having O
my H
equine O
chiro O
/ O
acupuncturist O
out H
to O
do O
some O
work N
as O
well O
if O
I H
do O
get O
him O
.... O

So O
any O
ideas N
? O

Think O
I H
should O
do O
it O
? O

Arby O
, O

Horse O
is O
out H
of O
state N
and O
not O
local O
. O

Owner H
is O
willing O
to O
meet O
me H
half O
way N
with O
him O
. O

I H
will O
be O
calling O
my H
vet H
and O
chiro O
about O
him O
. O

Worse O
comes O
to O
worse O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
out H
of O
the O
$$ O
and O
have O
to O
put O
him O
down O
anyway O
or O
have O
a O
pretty O
pasture N
ornament N
. O

He's O
He O
's H
still O
rideable O
currently O
and O
not O
having O
many O
issues N
under O
saddle N
. O

This O
is O
a O
horse A
that O
I H
otherwise O
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
afford O
and O
even O
if O
I H
spend O
2 O
K O
and O
treatment N
I H
come O
out H
ahead O
of O
his O
purchase N
price N
. O

I H
posted O
what O
the O
owner H
as O
said O
in O
paragraph N
2 O
& O
3 O
, O
that O
is O
not O
me H
to O
clarify O
. O

She O
is O
the O
one N
that O
can't O
ca O
n't O
afford O
to O
do O
anything O
else O
for O
him O
in O
case N
he O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
recover O
fully O
. O

He O
can O
eat O
grain N
and O
I H
already O
have O
a O
feed O
regimen N
in O
my H
head N
for O
the O
guy H
since O
he O
can't O
ca O
n't O
eat O
regular O
hay N
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
will O
be O
hard O
to O
keep O
his O
weight N
up O
so O
long O
as O
he O
can O
eat O
the O
grain N
. O

I H
am O
not O
going O
to O
go O
pick O
up O
a O
horse A
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
afford O
. O

I H
am O
willing O
to O
pull O
the O
EPM O
test N
and O
treat O
. O

The O
owner H
is O
the O
one N
who O
is O
unable O
. O

I H
will O
also O
be O
having O
my H
other O
vet H
up O
who's O
who O
's H
a O
chiro O
& O
acupuncturist O
to O
evaluate O
him O
for O
wobblers N
. O

July O
is O
when O
he O
started O
to O
exhibit N
slight O
symptoms N
and O
the O
owner H
and O
vet H
originally O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
some O
nerve N
damage N
from O
something O
in O
the O
pasture N
with O
no O
visible O
injury N
. O

He's O
He O
's H
only O
exhibited O
weight N
loss N
and O
some O
muscle N
atrophy N
, O
with O
the O
slight O
toe N
drag N
and O
a O
bit N
of O
trouble N
with O
the O
right O
lead O
( O
which O
could O
or O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
be O
related O
) O
. O

The O

is O
not O

The O
horse A
is O
not O
in O
pain N
. O

He's O
He O
's H
not O
starving O
. O

He's O
He O
's H
dropping O
weight N
, O
but O
most O
of O
that O
came O
from O
being O
at O
the O
trainers H
trainer H
s H
and O
being O
ridden O
hard O
for O
60 O
days N
. O

He's O
He O
's H
not O
putting O
it O
back O
on O
. O

I H
know O
that O
I H
have O
the O
possibility N
of O
treating O
him O
and O
still O
having O
to O
put O
him O
down O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time N
I H
do O
know O
people N
who O
have O
had O
horses A
come O
back O
successfully O
after O
EPM O
. O

I H
know O
this O
is O
going O
to O
be O
expensive O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
willing O
to O
give O
it O
a O
shot N
. O

Gallop O
, O
I've O
I H
've O
already O
read O
that O
whole O
site N
and O
been O
reading O
through O
research N
articles N
from O
the O
research N
colleges N
as O
well O
. O

Looked O
at O
studies N
, O
treatment N
options N
and O
such O
. O

I H
will O
have O
the O
EPM O
test N
done O
before O
treating O
. O

The O
chiro O
/ O
acupuncturist O
will O
be O
there O
to O
evaluate O
the O
horse A
for O
wobblers N
which O
is O
often O
caused O
by O
spinal O
compression N
and O
can O
be O
confused O
with O
EPM O
. O

If O
that O
is O
the O
case N
then O
acupuncture N
isn't O
is O
n't O
going O
to O
hurt O
him O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
actually O
one N
of O
the O
alternative O
therapies N
for O
EPM O

I H
think O
it O
is O
wonderfully O
responsible O
that O
you H
are O
going O
into O
this O
rescue N
eyes N
open O
and O
are O
getting O
the O
opinions N
of O
qualified O
professionals H
( O
and O
a O
bunch N
of O
Yahoos H
) O
before O
you H
decide O
to O
take O
this O
horse A
on O
. O

I H
do O
think O
some O
Y!A O
users H
need O
to O
work N
on O
their O
reading O
comprehension N
as O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
comprehend O
how O
taking O
a O
horse A
in O
as O
a O
rescue N
and O
getting O
it O
qualified O
medical O
treatment N
is O
abuse N
. O

Worst O
case N
scenario N
you H
fall N
in O
love O
and O
after O
spending N
thousands N
of O
dollars N
you H
have O
to O
put O
the O
horse A
down O
. O

Is O
that O
something O
you H
are O
up O
for O
? O

If O
so O
go O
for O
it O
and O
I'll O
I H
'll O
give O
you H
all O
the O
moral O
support N
I H
can O
as O
you H
figure O
out H
what O
is O
up O
. O

It O
is O
heartbreaking O
to O
try O
to O
bring O
a O
horse A
back O
and O
then O
have O
to O
put O
it O
down O
, O
but O
some O
horses A
are O
worth N
the O
risk N
. O

If O
you H
feel O
this O
guy H
is O
worth N
it O
then O
I H
hope O
your H
vet H
can O
figure O
things N
out H
. O

As O
to O
EPM O
like O
Shee O
said O
being O
in O
MI O
we've O
we H
've O
had O
to O
deal O
with O
it O
. O

Pretty O
much O
every O
large O
stable O
has O
here O
. O

Our H
first O
diagnosed O
EPM O
horse A
was O
back O
when O
there O
was O
no O
treatment N
in O
the O
US O
and O
only O
an O
experimental O
chicken N
feed O
additive N
in O
Canada O
. O

We H
hauled O
the O
horse A
to O
Windsor O
and O
got O
him O
treated O
there O
. O

That O
horse A
returned O
to O
racing N
and O
we H
didn't O
did O
n't O
notice O
much O
difference N
. O

We've O
We H
've O
had O
a O
few O
since O
then O
, O
but O
none N
since O
our H
race N
horses A
began O
wintering O
in O
Florida O
. O

I H
have O
no O
idea N
if O
that O
is O
related O
or O
farmers H
are O
doing O
a O
better O
job N
of O
clearing O
out H
opossums A
now O
because O
they O
know O
opossums A
are O
carriers N
, O
but O
we H
haven't O
have O
n't O
had O
an O
EPM O
horse A
in O
at O
least O
10 O
years N
. O

I H
can O
say O
all O
of O
our H
EPM O
horses A
were O
treated O
early O
when O
they O
were O
showing O
mild O
signs N
like O
Shee O
gave O
and O
all O
returned O
to O
racing N
. O

One O
horse A
even O
got O
his O
lifetime N
mark N
after O
being O
treated O
for O
EPM O
. O

We've O
We H
've O
always O
liked O
big O
long O
trotters N
that O
do O
better O
on O
mile N
tracks N
then O
1 O
/ O
2 O
mile N
. O

The O
only O
difference N
we H
noticed O
is O
that O
the O
EPM O
horses A
seemed O
to O
do O
worse O
on O
the O
smaller O
tracks N
after O
. O

It O
might O
just O
be O
coincidence N
or O
the O
fact N
those O
great O
big O
trotters N
with O
those O
extremely O
long O
backs N
lost O
a O
bit N
of O
fine O
coordination N
to O
get O
those O
gangly O
bodies N
around O
those O
tighter O
turns N
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

MSU O
does O
a O
lot N
of O
EPM O
studies N
because O
of O
how O
common O
it O
is O
here O
. O

You H
may O
want O
to O
see O
if O
you H
can O
get O
in O
touch O
with O
their O
EPM O
group N
and O
get O
this O
guy H
in O
a O
study O
. O

I H
know O
they O
did O
lab N
work N
showing O
that O
Strongid O
C N
used O
daily O
could O
help O
prevent O
EPM O
. O

I H
believe O
they O
have O
a O
real O
study O
testing O
the O
lab N
work N
in O
real O
world N
situations N
now O
, O
but O
it O
may O
be O
some O
time N
before O
those O
results N
are O
released O
. O

Another O
thought O
with O
this O
being O
a O
mosquito A
season N
from O
hell N
could O
it O
be O
West O
Nile O
? O

West O
Nile O
can O
cause N
EPM O
like O
symptoms N
and O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
always O
include O
a O
fever N
. O

Let O
us H
know O
what O
you H
decide O
to O
do O
. O

You H
hate O
to O
see O
talent N
get O
wasted O
, O
but O
honestly O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
think O
I H
could O
take O
in O
a O
horse A
right O
now O
these O
issues N
. O

Personally O
I H
think O
you H
should O
just O
keep O
on O
walking O
by O
. O

You H
should O
have O
you H
chiro O
out H
before O
you H
decide O
if O
you H
want O
this O
horse A
or O
not O
. O

If O
you H
have O
a O
good O
repoire N
( O
which O
I'm O
I H
'm O
sure O
you H
do O
) O
with O
them O
, O
they O
should O
be O
honest O
on O
if O
this O
horse A
is O
fixable O
to O
any O
degree N
... O
not O
really O
sure O
what O
you H
want O
to O
do O
with O
him O
... O

Even O
if O
you H
can O
figure O
out H
what O
is O
wrong O
with O
this O
poor O
poneh A
, O
there O
is O
always O
the O
chance N
for O
remission N
and O
then O
relapse N
so O
you H
may O
have O
to O
do O
deal O
with O
again O
in O
the O
future N
. O

So O
all O
in O
all O
, O
put O
the O
money N
up O
front N
before O
taking O
on O
this O
horse A
. O

A H
few O
hundred O
out H
of O
pocket N
now O
will O
possibly O
save O
you H
thousands N
once O
the O
horse A
is O
in O
your H
name N
. O

Could O
he O
have O
had O
a O
blow O
to O
the O
head N
causing O
this O
atrophy N
? O

Or O
a O
difficult O
birth N
? O

Was O
it O
always O
like O
this O
? O

Or O
has O
it O
occurred O
since O
birth N
. O

I H
also O
wonder O
if O
he O
might O
have O
had O
a O
slight O
stroke N
? O

I H
think O
if O
you H
cannot O
can O
not O
afford O
to O
get O
him O
treated O
that O
you H
should O
not O
consider O
him O
as O
a O
prospect N
. O

Who O
knows O
what O
the O
future N
might O
hold O
, O
and O
it O
might O
be O
expensive O
? O

Extremely O
bad O
customer H
service N

Do O
not O
go O
to O
this O
salon N
, O
especially O
if O
you H
have O
to O
get O
your H
hair N
straightened O
. O

They O
did O
a O
very O
bad O
job N
with O
my H
hair N
and O
were O
extremely O
rude O
when O
I H
went O
back O
to O
ask O
them O
why O
it O
didn't O
did O
n't O
work N
for O
my H
hair N
. O

Rude O
, O
insensitive O
, O
discourteous O
people N
!!!!! O

neck N

he O

Pure O
Pilates O

It O
is O
the O
real O
thing N
- O
I H
have O
been O
practicing O
Pilates O
for O
over O
7 O
years N
and O
would O
not O
go O
anywhere O
else O
. O

It O
is O
the O
attention N
to O
detail N
and O
the O
quality N
of O
the O
work N
taught O
at O
TomiPilates O
that O
sets N
this O
studio N
apart O
from O
the O
others O
. O

The O
teachers H
are O
highly O
trained O
and O
are O
expert H
at O
handling N
all O
types N

clients H
. O

I H
phoned O
this O
company N
for O
advice N
on O
our H
office N
refurb O
and O
although O
we H
did O
not O
use H
them O
in O
the O
end N
( O
as O
our H
building N
contractor H
carried O
out H
the O
electrical O
work N
) O
, O
they O
provided O
me H
with O
plenty O
of O
useful O
information N
over O
an O
hour N
phone N
call O
and O
subsequently O
we H
are O
now O
using O
PJC O
as O
our H
electrical O
maintenance N
contractor H
. O

Thoroughly O
recommended O

They O
really O
go O
above O
and O
beyond O
! O

For O
example N
, O
I H
actually O
forgot O
to O
feed O
my H
cat A
, O
and O
they O
went O
out H
of O
their O
way N
to O
take O
care N
of O
him O
. O

Additionally O
, O
when O
there O
was O
confusion N
( O
my H
fault N
) O
, O
they O
left O
me H
flowers A
along O
with O
a O
personalized O
gift N
. O

They O
have O
been O
100 O
% O
reliable O
and O

Never O

he O
was O
willing O

budge O
a O

means N
a O

First O

It's O
It O
's H

to O

a O
quite O
a O
bit N
about O

If O
you H

research N
some O
of O
the O
history N

) O
you H

find O
yourself H
enjoying O
it O
a O

Also O
after O
seeing O
a O
handful N
of O
bullfights N

I H
can O
say O
that O
they're O
they O
're O
a O
lot N
more O
enjoyable O
if O
you're H
you H
're O
smashed O
( O

All O
I H
can O
say O
is O
that O
I H
am O
glad O

According O

news N

the O

I H
have O
many O
fond O

the O

First O

Our H
window N
panes N
were O
so O
dirty O
that O
they O
needed O
a O
specialist H
to O
come O
and O
clean O
them O
. O

We H
called O
few O
companies N
before O
we H
decide O
to O
hire O
them O
. O

They O
came O
on O
time N
and O
completed O
their O
work N
quickly O
. O

We H
were O
very O
happy O
how O
clean O
looked O
our H
windows N

If O
you H
have O
some O
problems N

your H

you H

Great H

I H

I H
came O
in O
30 O
min N
before O
close O
and O
the O
staff N
was O
super O
helpful O
. O

They O
spent O
a O
lot N
of O
time N
with O
me H
and O
got O
me H
into O
a O
great O
pair N
of O
shoes N

I H
think O
they O
may O
even O
be O
better O
than O
the O

I H
have O

gone O

again O
whenever O
I H
need O
to O
get O
my H
hair N
done O
or O
when O
I H
want O

When O
I H
get O
my H
hair N
done O
there O
, O
they O
use H
enough O
hairstyling O
products N
while O
it O
does O
not O
ruin N
your H
hair N
. O

The O
service N
is O
great O
and O
during O
weekends N
it O
tends O
to O
get O
busy O
, O
but O
the O
wait N
is O
worthwhile O

Highly O
Recommend O

I H
have O
worked O

No O
matter N
what O
state N
I H
am O

the O

Dr. O

been O
a O
strong O
advocate O

My H

I H
avoided O
doing O
some O
fairly O
simple O
electrical O
re-wiring O
in O
our H
home N
for O
several O
years N
due O
to O
overall O
hassle N
and O
cost O
involved O
. O

I H
finally O
called O
Matt H
from O
Bonafide O
and O
he O
made O
the O
project N
both O
easy O
for O
us H
and O
reasonable O
. O

He O
was O
prompt O
, O
knowledgable O
, O
friendly O
, O
clean O
and O
just O
an O
overall O
great O
guy H
who O
obviously O
cares O
about O
his O
business N

I H
will O
reccommend O
his O
services N
however O

whenever O
possible O

Eulogic O

Good O
place N
to O
be O
on O
a O
Sunday O
Night N
. O

The O
beers N
were O
good O
, O
nice O
choice N
of O
beers N
as O
well O
, O
and O
as O
usual O
the O
mussels N
were O
great O
, O
the O
place N
upstairs O
is O
a O
nice O
addition N
to O
the O
bar N
downstairs O
. O

Filled O
up O
on O
too O
much O
beer N
and O
hence O
cannot O
can O
not O
comment O
on O
the O
food N
. O

But O
the O
menu N
had O
standard O
stuff N
that O
one N
would O
get O
at O
a O
Belgian O
Tavern N
. O

If O
you H
are O
a O
handcraft N
beer N
person H
, O
this O
is O
a O
fantastic O
place N
to O
be O
. O

Perfect O
Location N
plus O

I H
moved O
into O
the O
Tanglewood O
Apartments N
in O
late O
2008 O
and O
it's O
it O
's H
been O
a O
refreshing O
change O
. O

I H
used O
to O
live O
at O
Meadowrun O
and O
that O
was O
a O
nightmare N
. O

The O
manager H
- O
Tiffany H
- O
is O
actually O
very O
nice O
so O
I'm O
I H
'm O
a O
bit N
surprised O
by O
other O
comments N
. O

She's O
She O
's H
very O
reachable O
and O
she O
has O
always O
responded O
quickly O
to O
any O
questions N
or O
requests N
. O

Plus O
she O
plans N
a O
monthly O
breakfasts N
and O
other O
events N
at O
the O
clubhouse N
which O
is O
a O
nice O
added O
benefit N
. O

great O
service N
/ O
deals N
- O
support N
this O
local O
business N

I H
have O
used O
these O
guys H
for O
new O
snows O
, O
fixing O
lots N
of O
flats N
, O
used O
replacement H
tires N
, O
and O
oil N
changes N
. O

They O
have O
the O
best O
prices N
locally O
and O
good O
customer H
service N
. O

One O
guy H
is O
a O
little O
surley O
, O
but O
who O
gives O
a O
crap N
as O
long O
as O
your H
car's O
car N
's H
work N
is O
outstanding O
. O

AND O
they're O
they O
're O
usually O
able O
to O
help O
you H
as O
a O
walk O
- O
in O
, O
and O
they're O
they O
're O
fast O
. O

Overall O
- O
good O
stuff N
. O

Another O
great O
business N
bites O
the O
dust N
! O

The O
best O
cakes N
EVER O
! O

A H
bit N
pricey O
, O
so O
I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
go O
very O
often O
, O
but O
it O
was O
always O
a O
treat O
when O
I H
did O
. O

The O
prices N
were O
worth N
what O
I H
got O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
assuming O
they O
are O
completely O
out H
of O
business N
since O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
find O
any O
contact O
information N
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
hoping O
the O
bakers H
continue O
to O
do O
their O
baking N
out H
of O
another O
place N
, O
because O
it O
would O
be O
a O
shame N
not O
to O
have O
these O
cakes N
any O
longer O
. O

Super O
nice O
people N
, O
really O
good O
food N

What O
I H
love O
most O
about O
this O
place N
, O
other O
than O
the O
food N
, O
is O
that O
eating O
here O
makes O
you H
feel O
like O
you're H
you H
're O
in O
a O
small O
town N
rather O
than O
Baltimore O
. O

The O
owners H
are O
really O
nice O
, O
they O
serve O
good O
food N
at O
a O
good O
price N
, O
and O
the O
option N
to O
eat O
outside O
on O
the O
deck N
( O
esp O
on O
the O
weekend N
whether O
there O
is O
hardly O
any O
traffic N
) O
is O
great O
. O

One O
of O
my H
top N
5 O
places N

eat O
in O
Baltimore O
. O

Overpriced O

This O
place N
is O
identical O
to O
the O
Youngstown O
Sports N
Grille O
, O
so O
I H
imagine O
they O
are O
owned O
/ O
operated O
by O
the O
same O
people N
. O

The O
food N
is O
mediocre O
at O
best O
, O
and O
largely O
overpriced O
given O
the O
portion N
size N
and O
quality N
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
even O
get O
me H
started O
on O
how O
expensive O
it O
is O
to O
drink N
there O
. O

I H
have O
ate O
here O
3 O
times N
since O
they O
first O
opened O
, O
and O
the O
service N
has O
been O
poor O
each O
time N
, O
the O
staff N
always O
comes O
across O
as O
somewhat O
rude O
and O
slow O
. O

I'll O
I H

I H
kept O
for O
several O
years N

Re-interviewed O

The O

in O
finding O
the O

for O

the O
care N
my H

If O

don't O
do O

Only O

I H

Food O
was O
good O
, O
but O
service N
means N
a O
lot N
to O
me H
. O

Dr. O
Chao H
you H
are O
the O
best O
dentist H
I H
have O
ever O
had O
. O

You H
are O
knowledgeable O
, O
professional O
, O
gentel O

kind N
. O

I H
wish O
I H
had O
you H
as O
my H
dentist H
early O
on O
in O
my H
life N
- O
maybe O
my H
teeth N
would O
have O
been O
a O
lot N
better O
then O
they O
are O
now O
, O
However O
I H
am O
glad O
you H
are O
my H
dentist H
now O
. O

Even O
though O
you H
are O
expensive O
. O

Thank O
you H
for O
helping O
to O
preserve O
my H
teeth N

You H
are O
meticulous O
in O
your H
work N

it O
shows N

Con O
Garage N

I H
brought O
my H
car N
in O
for O
a O
simple O
emissions N
test N
. O

I H
guess O
they O
figured O
me H
for O
an O
easy O
mark N
, O
and O
tried O
to O
explain O
that O
my H
car N
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
pass O
unless O
I H
replaced O
a O
hose N
. O

Ten O
minutes N
later O
, O
I H
took O
my H
car N
down O
the O
street N
and O
it O
passed O
the O
emissions N
test N
with O
flying O
colors N
. O

If O
you're H
you H
're O

, O
this O
is O
the O

for O
you H
. O

If O
not O
, O
go O
somewhere O
else O
. O

Rude O
service N

even O
though O
I H
have O
never O
tried O
hoa O
salon N
but O
I H
agree O
with O
other O
reviewers H
that O
they O
are O
rude O
. O

I H
called O
and O
asked O
about O
the O
price N
for O
hair N
updo O
and O
the O
receptionist H
or O
owner H
who O
aswered O
the O
phone N
refused O
to O
tell O
me H
, O
or O
even O
just O
give O
me H
an O
approximate O
price N
range N
. O

He O
told O
us H
to O
stop N
by O
the O
salon N
and O
then O
he O
will O
tell O
us H
the O
price N
. O

What O
kind N
of O
rude O
service N
is O
that O
? O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
waste O
my H
time N
with O
them O

The O

also O
excellent O

without O

Consistantly O
poor O

A H
lack N
of O

coupled O
with O
the O
distain N
for O

, O
makes O
this O
the O
worst O

I H
have O
used O
. O

Chasing O
them O
on O

from O
the O
day N
I H
moved O
in O

many O
of O

my H

( O

lots N
of O

, O

it O
turned O
out H

this O

FANTASTIC O
STORE N
!!! O

I H
came O
upon O
this O
store N
as O
the O
building N
caught O
my H
eye N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
located O
in O
the O
huge O
HONKA O
Log O
Homes O
building N
, O
by O
Walmart O
off O
of O
Evergreen O
Parkway O
. O

The O
store N
was O
decorated O
with O
furnishings N
& O
accessories N
. O

The O
friendly O
crew N
working O
was O
great O
& O
very O
helpful O
. O

This O

is O
what O
Colorado O

all O
about O

Also O
, O
I H
purchased O
some O

Lovely O
People N
, O
Great H
Hats O

I H
was O
saddened O
to O
see O
the O
reviews N
that O
claimed O
World N
Hats O
Mart O
has O
poor O
service N
. O

It O
led O
me H
to O
believe O
that O
the O
reviewers H
simply O
had O
difficulty N
tolerating O
people N
with O
strongly O
- O
accented O
English O
. O

The O
husband H
and O
wife H
who O
run O
this O
spot N
are O
lovely O
people N
. O

We H
have O
had O
many O
conversations N
with O
them O
and O
they O
have O
always O
been O
extremely O
patient H
with O
me H
as O
I H
tried O
on O
multiple O
hats N
in O
search N
of O
the O
right O
costumes N
for O
my H
magic N
act N
. O

I H
recommend O
them O
highly O
! O

DONT O
DO O
NT O
ever O
go O
there O
, O
not O
even O
if O
your H
car N
flips O
. O

Their O
service N
sucks O
to O
start O
off O
with O
, O
people N
are O
cruel O
and O
ignorant O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
compeltly O
dissatisfied O
with O
their O
service N
and O
their O
products N
. O

They O
DO O
NOT O

THRIVE O

Horrible O

I H
have O
been O
growing O
my H
hair N
out H
for O
1 O
year N
plus O
and O
went O
in O
to O
get O
1 O
inch N
taken O
off O
. O

I H
walked O
out H
with O
5 O
inch N
long O
hair N
on O
the O
top N
, O
2 O
inch N
long O
hair N
on O
the O
sides N
, O
and O
1.5 O
in O
the O
back O
. O

My H
hair N
is O
uneven O
and O
it O
looks O
rediculous O
. O

This O
woman H
should O
be O
working O
in O
supercuts O
... O
if O
that O
. O

This O
was O
a O
terrible O
experience N
and O
I H
hope O
that O
no O
one N
else O
goes O
through O
that O
. O

Do O
your H
self O
a O
favor N
and O
do O
not O
go O
to O
this O
establishment N
. O

The O
worst O
Burger O
King O
restaurant N
!!! O

I H
generally O
like O
the O
BK O
over O
the O
other O
fast O
serving O
restaurants N
; O
however O
, O
I H
regreted O
to O
visit O
this O
restaurant N
at O
my H
town N
. O

This O
is O
a O
shame N
of O
my H
adorable O
town N
, O
Branford O
. O

I H
ordered O
a O
kid H
meal N
with O
a O
milk N
and O
found O
a O
bottle N
was O
half O
opened O
already O
. O

I H
asked O
them O
to O
change O
it O
but O
they O
rudely O
said O
that O
it O
was O
okay O
. O

Disgusting O
french O
fries H
is O
very O
best O
menu N
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
go O
, O
or O
you H
will O
learn O
how O
to O
waste O
your H
money N
. O

Disappointed O

The O
Bad O
: O
I H
was O
at O
Napa O
recently O
and O
was O
unpleasantly O
surprised O
at O
poor O
waiter H
svce N
and O
subpar O
food N
. O

We H
were O
a O
party N
of O
4 O
and O
none N
of O
us H
were O
particularly O
pleased O
with O
our H
dishes N
. O

Napa O
is O
all O
about O
wine N
but O
gives O
very O
short O
descriptions N
of O
the O
wines N
on O
their O
lists O
. O

I H
found O
my H
initial O
selection N
satisfactory O
but O
found O
the O
wine N
flight N
we H
chose O
to O
be O
poorly O
composed O
. O

If O
you H
must O
go O
ask O
lots N
of O
questions N
about O
your H
selections N
since O
your H
expectations N
may O
as O
high O
as O
mine H
were O
. O

Highly O
Recommended O

We H
walked O
in O
to O
pick O
our H
little O
man H
at O
10 O
minutes N
to O
closing O
and O
heard O
laughter N
from O
kids H
and O
the O
staff N
. O

The O
facilities N
are O
more O
than O
adequate O
and O
the O
staff N
are O
just O
phenomenal O
. O

Their O
sense N
of O
humour N
and O
calmness N
when O
dealing O
with O
the O
little O
ones N
amazes O
me H
every O
time N
I H
walk O
in O
. O

We H
have O
since O
moved O
slightly O
further O
away O
from O
the O
centre N
but O
it's O
it O
's H
worth N
the O
extra O
travel O
, O
as O
the O
care N
provided O
exceeds O
our H
expectations N
... O
especially O
after O
a O
few O
horrendous O
daycare N
experiences N
elsewhere O
. O

HORRIBLE O
!!!! O
! O

This O
has O
to O
be O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
pizza N
I H
have O
ever O
had O
the O
misfortune N
of O
ordering O
. O

The O
crust N
was O
lopsided O
, O
thicker O
on O
one N
side N
than O
the O
other O
. O

It O
actually O
had O
a O
hole N
in O
one N
of O
the O
slices N
. O

There O
was O
minimal O
cheese N
and O
sauce N
and O
it O
completely O
lacked O
flavor N
. O

I H
know O
New H
York H
pizza N
and O
this O
is O
not O
it O
!! O

This O
was O
nothing N
like O
New H
York H
style N
pizza N
!!!. O

I H
love O
pizza N
and O
this O
was O
a O
complete O
and O
utter O
disappointment N
!! O

I H
would O
not O
suggest O
this O
pizza N
to O
anyone O
!!! O

with O

Once O
they O

it O
they O
answetred O
all O

no O

then O
gave O

Allen H
Tire O
was O
recommended O
by O
friend H
after O
my H
having O
bad O
tire N
experiences N
in O
Temecula O
. O

The O
store N
manager H
, O
Jim H
Smith H
, O
made O
an O
excellent O
tire N
recommendation N
for O
my H
newly O
acquired O
Lexus O
. O

Tires N
were O
the O
right O
price N
and O
now O
the O
car N
feels O
like O
it O
is O
riding N
on O
rails N
around O
turns N
. O

The O
store N
is O
clean O
, O
run O
very O
professionally O
and O
a O
pleasure N
to O
be O
in O
. O

They O
know O
their O
job N
and O
you H
do O
not O
have O
to O
watch O
them O
to O
be O
sure O
everything O
is O
done O
right O

Easiest O
Time N
I H
ever O
had O
purchasing O
a O
car N
! O

Excellent O
service N
, O
Not O
only O
did O
they O
get O
the O
exact O
car N
I H
wanted O
win O
in O
48 O
hours N
but O
the O
sales N
man H
also O
took O
me H
out H
to O
lunch N
. O

Very O
kind N
and O
reliable O
. O

I H
highly O
recommend O
this O
dealership N
if O
you H
would O
not O
like O
to O
hassle N
on O
price N
and O
receive O
friendly O
service N
. O

I H
have O
since O
purchased O
two O
cars N
from O
this O
dealership N
, O
The O
first O
one N
was O
from O
Phillip H
and O
the O
second N
was O
from O
Richard H
. O

Both O
were O
excellent O
sales N
men H
who O
put O
my H
needs N
first O
. O

This O
place N
has O
done O
a O
great O
job N
of O
taking O
care N
of O
the O
usual O
maintenance N
on O
my H
hooptie O
. O

I H
also O
never O
have O
to O
wait N
long O
for O
a O
yearly O
inspection N
sticker N
... O
and O
never O
get O
the O
usual O
excuses N
other O
shops N
always O
gave O
me H
... O
" O
the O
inspection N
guy H
isn't O
is O
n't O
here O
today N
" O
.... O
for O
example N

Today N
I H
went O
into O
Kwik O
Kar O
and O
there O
were O
two O
cars N
in O
front N
of O
me H
for O
inspection N
... O
but O
I H
was O
still O
out H
of O
there O
pretty O
quick O
... O
barely O
had O
time N
to O
read O
a O
chapter N
in O
my H

Extremely O

She O
worked O

Firstly O
, O
the O
other O
reviewer H
clearly O
has O
never O
been O
to O
Nick's O
Nick H
's H
, O
or O
he O
would O
know O
that O
Nick H
only O
charges N
$ O
13 O
for O
a O
haircut N
which O
is O
pretty O
much O
industry N
standard O
. O

I H
have O
been O
going O
to O
Nick H
for O
5 O
months N
now O
precisely O
because O
he O
does O
pay O
attention N
to O
detail N
. O

I H
have O
terrible O
hair N
and O
he O
really O
takes O
his O
time N
to O
make O
it O
look O
right O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
younger O
kids H
that O
work N
there O
are O
a O
bit N
sub O
par N
, O
but O
if O
you H
wait N
for O
Nick H
... O
you'll O
you H
'll O
be O
good O
. O

UGH O
!!! O

Got O
some O
nice O
" O
freshly O
baked O
" O
fruit N
squares N
, O
a O
personal O
favorite O
of O
mine H
. O

Took O
a O
bite N
, O
it O
tasted O
odd O
. O

Flipped O
the O
square N
over O
and O
saw O
it O
riddled O
with O
green O
mold N
!!!! O

Ugh O
!! O

I H
called O
the O
store N
and O
the O
clerk H
giggled O
, O
and O
agreed O
that O
it O
was O
gross O
, O
but O
said O
it O
was O
not O
her O
problem N
. O

She O
also O
refused O
to O
get O
a O
manager H
. O

I H
left O
my H
number N
, O
or O
tried O
to O
anyway O
. O

Same O
clerk H
had O
considerable O
difficulty N
taking O
down O
a O
number N
. O

I'll O
I H
'll O
never O
go O
back O
there O
again O

For O
cheap O
Chinese O
food N

at O
places N
like O

China O
or O
Green H

in O
Troy H
, O
MO O
- O
nothing N

won't O
wo O
n't O
eat O
fast O
food N
Chinese O
unless O
it's O
it O

from O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O

in O
Lake O
St. O
Louis H
anymore O

but O

and O
the O

Now O
I H

Jana H

the O
most O

Provided O

see O
all O
the O

his O

that O

not O
change O
his O
level N

In O

BEST O
PLACE N
IN O
AMES O

I H
lived O
here O
for O
two O
years N
when O
the O
prices N
were O
a O
little O
lower O
:) O
The O
places N
are O
very O
nice O
and O
clean O
, O
and O
in O
great O
condition N
! O

I H
really O
enjoyed O
the O
staff N
at O
Wessex O
, O
also O
the O
manager H
Sherri O
was O
always O
very O
nice O
and O
helpful O
. O

The O
fitness N
center N
was O
GREAT O
! O

The O
only O
problem N
that O
I H
had O
in O
2 O
years N
of O
living O
there O
was O
that O
the O
walls N
are O
pretty O
thin O
, O
sometimes O
I H
could O
here O
my H
neighbors H
conversations N
. O

I H
would O
recommend O
these O
apartments N
to O
anybody O
! O

I H
absolutely O
LOVED O
living O
there O

The O

very O
good O

The O
atmosphere N

not O
be O
for O
everyone O

It O
is O
a O
bustling O
place N
where O
separate O
parties N
are O
seated O
at O
the O
same O
table N
( O
as O
in O
many O
European O
cafes N
) O
, O
but O
if O
you H
are O
OK O
with O
that O
, O
the O
food N

very O
good O

NJ O
for O
over O
30 O
years N
for O
summer N
vacations N
and O
always O
call O
the O
Madrid O
first O
. O

I H
rated O
it O
5 O
stars N
. O

I H
am O
not O
saying O
it O
is O
a O
5 O
star N
hotel N
. O

I H
am O
saying O
when O
comparing O
all O
other O
hotels N
in O
Wildwood O
, O
this O
hotel N
has O
everything O
that O
we H
are O
looking O
for O
. O

It O
is O
the O
hospitality N
from O
Tom H
and O
staff N
, O
that O
makes O
it O
feel O
like O
a O
5 O
star N
hotel N
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
beach N
. O

We H
prefer O
the O
layout N
of O
rooms N
and O
it O
is O
always O
clean O

When O

Sicily O

If O
ever O
in O
Sicily O
please O
take O
the O
time N
to O
visit O
Anna H
Maria H
Jose H
Mudo O
and O
her O
familia O
. O

They O
are O
and O
always O
will O
be O
the O
nicest O
people N
in O
Sicily O
that O
you H
will O
meet O
. O

You H
will O
also O
have O
the O
pleasure N
of O
learning O
the O
Italiano O
language N
. O

You H
will O
also O
have O
the O
experience N
of O
learning O
the O
bella O
Sicilian O
culture N
, O
that O
I H
have O
fallen O
in O
luv N
with O

I H
will O
4-ever O
be O
eternally O
grateful O
for O
their O

Luv N
always O

I've O
I H
've O
never O
felt N
the O
need O
to O
write O
a O
review N
or O
make O
a O
complaint N
before O
, O
but O
after O
the O
way N
I H
was O
spoken O
to O
by O
a O
member N
of O
staff N
at O
the O
kennels N
( O
whose O
name N
I H
believe O
to O
be O
Mrs N
Closs O
) O
I H
would O
now O
not O
recommend O
this O
business N
to O
anybody O
. O

If O
the O
animals A
are O
treated O
in O
the O
same O
way N
the O
customers H
are O
treated O
then O
this O
leaves N
a O
lot N
to O
be O
desired O
! O

Nobody O
should O
be O
spoken O

like O
that O
regardless O
of O
how O
bad O

Best O
Car N
Dealer O
in O
TX O

I H
purchased O
a O
nissan O
from O
this O
dealship N
. O

The O
sales N
men H
were O
very O
knowledgeable O
about O
every O
aspect N
of O
every O
car N
we H
looked O
at O
. O

They O
were O
very O
patient H
and O
helpful O
from O
showing O
the O
cars N
to O
doing O
the O
paperwork N
. O

The O
paperwork N
was O
a O
very O
easy O
and O
smooth O
. O

They O
tried O
to O
run O
my H
credit N
score N
as O
less O
as O
possible O
so O
it O
won't O
wo O
n't O
hurt O
my H
score N
. O

Overall O
, O
I H
was O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
customer H
service N
and O
my H
purchase N
. O

If O
you're H
you H
're O
looking O
to O
buy O
a O
car N
, O
definitely O
give O
them O
a O
call O
. O

They O
have O
a O
huge O
inventory N
. O

I H
have O
been O
a O
patient H
a O
NW O
hospital N
and O
it O
was O
great O
. O

I H
have O
also O
had O
an O
80 O
yr N
old O
that O
I H
take O
of O
sent O
to O
the O
ER N
and O
long O
stays N
in O
the O
hospital N
. O

Yes O
, O
we H
had O
to O
wait N
, O
but O
ER N
is O
a O
triage N
system N
that O
takes O
the O
most O
life N
threatening O
cases N
first O
. O

Any O
ER N
would O
be O
the O
same O
. O

As O
far O
as O
being O
treated O
like O
a O
drug N
seeker H
, O
that O
has O
not O
been O
my H
experience N
. O

As O
a O
nurse O
I H
know O
about O
drug N
seekers H
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
hospital N
and O
even O
better O
since O
it O
became O
part N
of O
the O
UW O
system N
. O

Wonderful O
Experience O

I H
had O
immense O
pain N
on O
a O
Sunday O
morning N
, O
with O
friends H
and O
family H
telling O
me H
that O
I H
would O
never O
find O
a O
Dentist H
on O
a O
Sunday O
. O

Dr. O
Taylor H
was O
not O
only O
available O
on O
a O
Sunday O
, O
but O
also O
was O
able O
to O
immediately O
take O
care N
of O
me H
. O

He O
was O
incredibly O
informative O
about O
the O
options N
I H
had O
, O
giving O
me H
opinions N
on O
different O
treatments N
to O
choose O
from O
. O

Coming O
from O
a O
person H
who O
hates O
the O
dentist H
in O
general O
, O
Dr. O
Taylor H
was O
the O
best O
! O

He O
really O
made O
the O
visit O
a O
pain N
free O
one N
with O
excellent O
service N
! O

I H
would O
recommend O
him O
to O
everyone O
! O

HORRIBLE O

This O
school N
is O
the O
worst O
one N
i've O
i H
've O
ever O
been O
to O
. O

I H
attended O
it O
for O
2 O
years N
, O
and O
that O
was O
enough O
. O

There's O
There O
's H
holes N
everywhere O
in O
the O
ceiling N
, O
sewage N
constantly O
leaks O
through O
the O
ceiling N
, O
and O
the O
whole O
condition N
of O
the O
school N
is O
horrible O
. O

The O
staff N
and O
the O
Principal O
are O
rediculous O
, O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
listen O
to O
any O
input N
, O
and O
they O
make O
up O
rediculous O
rules N
( O
They O
banned O
backpacks N
, O
because O
a O
teacher H
TRIPPED O
OVER O
a O
student's O
student H
's H
) O
. O

The O
education N
is O
horrible O
at O
best O
, O
do O
society N
a O
favor N
, O
and O
do O
NOT O
send O
your H
student H
here O
. O

Excellent O
customer H
service N
and O
quality N
work N
. O

They O
went O
the O
extra O
mile N
to O
repair N
my H
cowboy H
boots N
-- O
they O
had O
to O
have O
a O
special O
kind N
of O
paper N
that O
looked O
like O
wood N
grain N
to O
fix O
the O
heels N
. O

That O
was O
4 O
years N
ago O
. O

I H
haven't O
have O
n't O
been O
able O
to O
find O
a O
shoe N
repair N
place N
in O
Seattle O
since O
that O
has O
been O
able O
to O
do O
it O
. O

( O
I've O
I H
've O
been O
through O
at O
least O
5 O
places N
already O
. O
) O

If O
I H
had O
time N
to O
drive O
to O
Tacoma O
before O
they O
closed O
during O
the O
work N
week N
, O
I H
would O
just O
so O
I H
could O
get O
those O
boots N
fixed O
properly O
again O
. O

So O
Handy O
for O
Local O
La O
Jolla O
Stuff N
- O
Especially O
for O
Finding O
Residential O
Numbers N

Since O
moving O
back O
from O
college N
and O
trying O
to O
settle O
roots N
in O
the O
Village O
, O
I H
have O
referred O
to O
the O
La O
Jolla O
Blue O
Book O
for O
a O
ton N
of O
local O
numbers N
. O

The O
white O
pages N
allowed O
me H
to O
get O
in O
touch O
with O
parents H
of O
my H
high O
school N
friends H
so O
that O
I H
could O
track N
people N
down O
one N
by O
one N
and O
the O
restaurant N
section N
is O
basically O
my H
cookbook N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
really O
cool O
that O
so O
many O
local O
businesses N
are O
found O
so O
quickly O
in O
one N
place N
and O
I H
want O
to O
spread O
the O
word N
. O

THX N
:-) O

The O
staff N
do O
occasionally O
get O
game N
info N
correct O
, O
but O
if O
your H
you H
r O
looking O
fot O
a O
good O
game N
and O
aren't O
are O
n't O
a O
nerd H
, O
dont O
do O
nt O
ask O
them O
. O

The O
last O
time N
I H
did O
that O
I H
was O
suggested O
to O
buy O
oblivion O
when O
I H
told O
them O
I H
was O
looking O
for O
a O
fps N
. O

I H
knew O
what O
it O
was O
and O
told O
the O
guy H
that O
it O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
a O
fps N
. O

He O
tried O
to O
tell O
me H
it O
was O
when O
I H
told O
asked O
him O
if O
he O
knew O
what O
fps N
stood O
for O
and O
he O
had O
no O
clue N
. O

Overall O
they O
aren't O
are O
n't O
very O
knowledge N
about O
the O
type N
of O
games N
are O
on O
the O
market N
. O

First O
and O
Last O
time N
we'll O
we H
'll O
eat O
there O

My H
friend H
and O
I H
went O
there O
for O
lunch N
today N
. O

Neither O
one N
of O
us H
had O
ever O
been O
- O
so O
we H
thought O
we'd O
we H
'd O
try O
it O
. O

BIG O
MISTAKE N

The O
food N
was O
tasteless O
and O
cold O
. O

We H
both O
kept O
trying O
to O
find O
something O
we H
liked O
. O

The O
only O
thing N
I H
found O
edible O
were O
the O
potato N
wedges N
, O
I H
finally O
gave O
up O
, O
he O
kept O
trying O
- O
he O
found O
the O
fried O
wantons N
to O
be O
OK O
- O
His O
Mongolian O
bowl N
was O
awful O
. O

Would O
NOT O
recommend O
this O
place N
to O
anyone O
- O
in O
fact N
- O
save O
your H
money N
and O
go O
somewhere O
else O

Liquidweb.com O
Rocks N
!!! O

I H
am O
not O
a O
client H
of O
liquidweb.com O
, O
but O
one N
of O
my H
friend H
called O
Steven H
is O
the O
client H
having O
several O
websites N
. O

I H
work N
with O
him O
and O
since O
past N
6 O
years N
he O
is O
hosting O
his O
websites N
to O
Liquidweb O
. O

As O
I H
have O
gone O
through O
many O
reviews N
sites N
to O
see O
if O
any O
provider H
is O
providing O
better O
services N
or O
not O
, O
and O
I H
have O
realized O
that O
there O
were O
many O
good O
reviews N
about O
Liquidweb O
also O
Steven H
never O
faced O
any O
server H
issues N
in O
his O
whole O

The O
kind N
of O
support N
they O
provide O
is O
simply O
great O
!!! O

I H
would O
like O
to O
host H
my H
upcoming O

David H
is O
amazing O

David H
is O
the O
most O
helpful O
and O
creative O
photographer H
that O
I H
have O
used O
. O

He O
is O
willing O
to O
do O
whatever O
you H
need O
from O
him O
without O
hesitation N
. O

He O
was O
patient H
and O
adapted O
when O
everything O
didn't O
did O
n't O
go O
according O
to O
schedule N
on O
my H
wedding N
day N
. O

Both O
the O
engagement N
and O
wedding N
pictures N
that O
he O
took O
for O
us H
we H
absolutely O
amazing O
. O

He O
got O
the O
pictures N
back O
to O
me H
quickly O
. O

I H
would O
highly O
recommend O
David H
to O
anyone O
. O

He O
will O
exceed O
your H
expectations N
! O

He O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
just O
take O
pictures N
he O
makes O
art N
out H
of O
them O
and O
you H
won't O
wo O
n't O
even O
notice O
that O
there's O
there O
's H
a O
camera N
there O
. O

Not O
so O
great O

My H
husband H
just O
got O
a O
bike N
there O
as O
a O
gift N
he's O
he O
's H
only O
had O
it O
a O
month N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
a O
nice O
bike N
and O
it O
cost O
a O
lot N
of O
money N
. O

But O
just O
this O
week N
a O
peddle N
broke O
. O

He O
took O
it O
back O
and O
they O
would O
not O
honor N
a O
warranty N
and O
said O
it O
was O
his O
fault N
because O
of O
his O
shoes N
?? O

So O
they O
were O
going O
to O
charge O
him O
for O
new O
peddles N
and O
proceeded O
to O
put O
them O
on O
without O
even O
telling O
him O
the O
price N
. O

Which O
was O
very O
expensive O
. O

He O
asked O
for O
a O
different O
pair N
instead O
and O
they O
only O
gave O
him O
five O
dollars N
off O
?? O

Trek O
is O
not O
so O
great O

Only O
Concerned O
With O
Money N

I H
have O
been O
getting O
my H
treatments N
for O
a O
few O
months N
now O
and O
have O
seen O
some O
results N
but O
not O
up O
to O
the O
standards N
that O
I H
was O
told O
I H
should O
expect O
. O

The O
people N
there O
attempt N
to O
come O
across O
and O
professional O
and O
nice O
, O
but O
I H
was O
disappointed O
with O
their O
customer H
service N
. O

Never O
miss O
an O
appointment N
because O
they O
will O
charge O
you H
the O
price N
of O
a O
treatment N
, O
even O
if O
you H
had O
an O
emergency N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
pretty O
ridiculous O
! O

They O
want O
to O
squeeze O
as O
much O
as O
they O
can O
from O
you H
even O
if O
you H
just O
got O
in O
a O
car N
accident N
!!!! O

They O
don't O
do O
n't O
care N
one N
bit N
about O
you H
!!!!! O

Terrible O
service N
!!! O

Made O
an O
appointment N
to O
have O
them O
come O
to O
the O
house N
to O
discuss O
curtain N
options N
and O
give O
an O
estimate N
. O

They O
sent O
over O
someone H
who O
said O
he O
knows O
nothing N
about O
curtains N
and O
could O
not O
show O
me H
fabric N
options N
or O
give O
an O
estimate N
. O

When O
I H
called O
the O
manager H
to O
complain O
, O
she O
said O
she O
KNEW O
the O
guy H
didn't O
did O
n't O
know O
about O
curtains N
and O
that O
the O
usual O
lady H
called O
in O
sick O
hours N
earlier O
! O

Instead O
of O
rescheduling O
they O
chose O
to O
waste O
my H
time N
instead O
. O

So O
what O
was O
the O
point N
of O
the O
appointment N
!?! O

To O
just O
come O
over O
and O
hang O
out H
?!? O

I H
will O
NEVER O
do O
business N
with O
this O
company N
! O

EVER O
!!! O

Internet N
Department O
is O
rude O
and O
insulting O

I H
was O
looking O
to O
bring O
a O
customer H
to O
their O
lot N
to O
buy O
a O
car N
but O
the O
Internet N
salesperson H
Last O
name N
is O
Balazick O
sent O
me H
this O
email N
" O
AND O
IF O
IT N
WAS O
WORTH O
MY H
TIME N
I H
WOULD O
OF O
BOTHERED O
ASWERING O
YOUR H
QUESTIONS N
. O

I H
MAKE O
MONEY N
NOT O
DEAL N
WITH O
BROKERS H
" O
Wow O
, O
can O
you H
believe O
in O
todays O
today N
s H
tough O
times N
this O
dealership N
would O
be O
looking O
for O
any O
way N
to O
move O
vehicles N
. O

As O
a O
previous O
Internet N
Manager H
I H
would O
deal O
with O
anyone O
looking O
to O
buy O
a O
car N
for O
a O
profit N
and O
not O
care N
if O
they O
came O
in O
with O
a O
broker H
. O

Stay O
away O
from O
this O
dealership N
!!! O

This O
place N
is O
a O
Rip N
- O
Off O

I H
brought O
a O
car N
in O
to O
have O
the O
" O
check O
engine N
" O
light N
diagnosed O
back O
in O
March O
of O
2010 O
. O

They O
said O
it O
was O
" O
plugs N
and O
wires N
" O
and O
quoted O
me H
$ O
330 O
to O
do O
the O
work N
, O
including O
parts N
. O

I H
asked O
why O
so O
high O
and O
they O
said O
it O
was O
due O
to O
the O
labor N
of O
moving O
things N
out H
of O
the O
way N
. O

Those O
things N
ended O
up O
being O
a O
windsheild N
washer N
fluid O
tank N
( O
1 O
screw N
) O
and O
the O
air N
filter N
canister N
( O
4 O
spring N
clips N
) O
. O

I H
did O
the O
work N
myself H
for O
$ O
50 O
. O

There's O
There O
's H
no O
excuse O
for O
that O
kind N
of O
estimate N
. O

My H
girlfriend H
and O
I H
took O
a O
chance N
on O
this O
place N

did O

want O
to O
wait N
in O

very O
harshly O
I H
might O
add O
) O
grabbing O
and O
' O
kissed O
' O
the O
goats A
and O
lambs A
. O

The O
animals A
were O
all O
very O
sweet O
and O
patient H
with O
her O
. O

Among O
the O
animals A
that O
were O
available O
to O
touch O
were O

Worst O
Service O
I've O
I H
've O
Ever O
Experienced O

I H
wish O
there O
was O
something O
good O
to O
say O
about O
the O
business N
, O
but O
unfortunately O
, O
there O
isn't O
is O
n't O
. O

1 O
) O
Service O
and O
manners N
were O
nonexistent O
. O

2 O
) O
The O
employees H
constantly O
talk O
down O
to O
customers H
and O
are O
very O
argumentative O
for O
the O
sake N
of O
being O
argumentative O
. O

( O
to O
both O
myself H
and O
customers H
) O
3 O
) O
I H
have O
never O
experienced O
so O
much O
rudeness N
coming O
from O
a O
business N
. O

4 O
) O
The O
business N
is O
very O
unorganized O
. O

The O
invoice N
is O
not O
detailed O
, O
so O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
see O

I'd O
I H

recommend O
to O
save O
your H
time N
and O
energy N
and O
find O
another O
greek O
store N

Exile O
is O
the O
best O
!!! O

Exile O
is O
the O
longest O
lasting O
and O
most O
authentic O
punk N
store N
in O
Richmond O
! O

I H
have O
been O
shopping O
there O
for O
over O
six O
years N
now O
. O

The O
staff N
is O
incredibly O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
and O
the O
owner H
, O
Mimmy O
, O
is O
an O
absolute O
angel A
. O

The O
mark N
up O
is O
minimal O
considering O
that O
the O
clothing N
is O
hard O
to O
find O
and O
often O
shipped O
for O
Europe O
. O

In O
addition N
, O
the O
clothing N
is O
of O
much O
better O
quality N
than O
the O
clothing N
from O
hot O
topic N
, O
which O
is O
made O
as O
cheaply O
as O
possible O
by O
people N
living O
in O
horrible O
conditions N
in O
Asia O
. O

Exile O
is O
environmentally O
conscious O

Over-rated O

Buddakan O
inevitably O
attracts O
the O
majority N
of O
its O
guests H
simply O
because O
of O
its O
association N
with O
Steven H
Starr H
, O
but O
that O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
impress O
me H
. O

The O
atmosphere N
alone O
deserves O
4 O
stars N
but O
, O
the O
food N
was O
not O
up O
to O
par N
with O
the O
price N
tag O
and O
the O
reputation N
the O
restaurant N
carries O
. O

The O
server H
we H
had O
was O
knowledgeable O
but O
he O
was O
not O
as O
proper O
as O
he O
should O
have O
been O
, O
acting N
like O
he O
was O
talking O
to O
his O
friends H
rather O
than O
his O
customers H
. O

The O
angry O
lobster N
was O
completely O
over-priced O
! O

$ O
80 O
for O
a O
dish N
that O
has O
about O
one N
small O
lobster N
tail N
and O
is O
full O
of O
filler N
vegetables N
! O

I H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
go O
there O
again O
. O

Alto O
delivers O
on O
all O
levels N
. O

From O
the O
moment N
you H
enter O
the O
restaurant N
, O
you H
know O
you H
are O
some O
place N
special O
. O

The O
service N
is O
impeccable O
, O
and O
the O
food N
is O
even O
better O
. O

I H
highly O
recommend O
the O
four O
- O
course N
tasting O
menu N
, O
which O
gives O
you H
plenty O
of O
range N
and O
food N
to O
satisfy O
your H
appetite N
. O

Also O
, O
if O
you H
are O
into O
wine N
, O
Alto O
has O
the O
depth N
of O
both O
region N
, O
varietal N
, O
and O
vintage N
to O
satisfy O
nearly O
any O
sommelier H
( O
or O
after O
9 O
pm O
, O
bring O
your H
own O
bottle N
for O
free O
... O
no O
corking O
fee N
! O
) O
. O

While O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
cheap O
, O
Alto H
will O
give O
you H
an O
experience N
you'll O
you H
'll O
never O
forget O
. O

The O
landlord H
is O
not O
nice O
nor O
helpful O

I H
have O
lived O
in O
Buckingham O
Condominiums O
townhouse O
for O
2 O
years N
. O

I H
love O
the O
location N
and O
the O
apartment N
!! O

I'm O
I H
'm O
a O
single O
female O
and O
I H
feel O
safe O
coming O
home N
at O
night N
. O

The O
maintenance N
people N
are O
AWESOME O
!!!! O

And O
the O
exterminator H
is O
very O
nice O
, O
also O
. O

Yes O
, O
you H
still O
have O
a O
few O
bugs A
, O
but O
that's O
that O
's H
going O
to O
be O
anywhere O
you H
go O
! O

The O
only O
problem N
that O
I H
have O
experienced O
is O
the O
landlord H
. O

She O
is O
a O
pure O
b**** H
!!! O

I H
know O
that's O
that O
's H
ugly O
... O
but O
she O
won't O
wo O
n't O
help O
you H
out H
for O
anything O
... O
sad O
story N
. O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
I H
would O
recommend O
living O
here O
. O
:) O

The O
staff N
leaves N
a O
lot N
to O
be O
desired O
. O

The O
front N
staff N
has O
seen O
quite O
a O
bit N
of O
turnover N
and O
changed O
from O
professional O
to O
rude O
. O

A H
simple O
follow O
- O
up O
phone N
call O
with O
a O
woman H
quickly O
turned O
into O
a O
nightmare N
. O

She O
may O
be O
the O
reason N
for O
all O
the O
change O
. O

I H
sincerely O
wonder O
if O
the O
doctor H
has O
a O
clue N
about O
what O
is O
going O
on O
within O
his O
practice O
. O

If O
he O
does O
know O
and O
approves O
of O
this O
behavior N
then O
it O
is O
a O
poor O
reflection N
on O
him O
. O

Sometimes O
it O
is O
not O
worth N
it O
to O
go O
through O
that O
kind N
of O
staff N
and O
their O
personal O
attitude N
to O
get O
to O
a O
doctor H
. O

He O
was O
an O
okay O
doctor H
but O
not O
worth N
her O
. O

I H

more O
like O

I H

A H
friend H
and O
I H
recently O
took O
our H
16 O
and O
18 O
month N
olds N
here O
. O

While O
there O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
too O
much O
available O
for O
their O
age N
( O
ball N
pit N
, O
bouncy O
area N
and O
a O
little O
padded O
pyramid N
to O
climb O
on O
) O
, O
we H
went O
right O
when O
they O
opened O
at O
10 O
am O
on O
a O
winter N
weekday N
and O
ended O
up O
being O
the O
only O
ones N
there O
, O
so O
we H
were O
given O
a O
little O
more O
liberty N
than O
we H
would O
have O
if O
others O
had O
been O
there O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
not O
the O
classiest O
place N
, O
but O
it O
was O
cleaner N
than O
I H
expected O
and O
the O
staff N
was O
very O
friendly O
. O

For O
$ O
4 O
it O
was O
a O
nice O
break O
from O
the O
monotony N
of O
winter N
indoors O
with O
a O
toddler H
. O

Restored O
my H
faith N
in O
Mechaincs H
. O

I H
spent O
3 O
months N
going O
from O
shop N
to O
shop N
trying O
to O
get O
my H
Ferrari O
to O
run O
and O
drive O
the O
way N
it O
should O
. O

I H
was O
about O
to O
give O
up O
when O
I H
met O
Jason H
and O
Neal H
. O

They O
took O
on O
the O
challenge N
of O
making O
my H
Ferrari O
all O
I H
dreamed O
of O
and O
more O
. O

The O
crew N
at O
The O
Creative O
Workshop O
went O
over O
and O
above O
the O
call O
of O
duty N
and O
gave O
me H
back O
a O
car N
I H
can O
drive O
anywhere O
and O
finally O
enjoy O
owning O
. O

I H
cannot O
can O
not O
say O
enough O
about O
this O
place N
. O

They O
have O
restored O
my H
faith N
in O
Mechanics H
. O

Do O
yourself H
a O
favor N

call O
these O
guys H
first O
and O
enjoy O
driving O
your H
car N
again O

a O
great O
vacation N
! O

We H
wanted O
to O
see O
the O
sun N

and O
we H
also O
got O
much O
more O
! O

Excellent O
chefs H
are O
in O
the O
kitchen N
preparing O
memorable O
breakfasts N
. O

After O
a O
train N
ride O
over O
the O
mountains N
, O
we H
enjoyed O
hiking N
in O
the O
flower A
- O
filled O
Wenatchee O
hills N
( O
in O
May O
) O
and O
a O
very O
interesting O
bike N
ride O
in O
a O
loop N
around O
the O
Columbia O
River N
... O
and O
then O
wine N
if O
we H
wanted O
it O
on O
the O
patio N
in O
the O
evening N
.... O

This O
is O
a O
busy O
group N
of O
hosts O
they O
are O
also O
running O
a O
restaurant N
, O
which O
also O
must O
be O
wonderful O
- O
so O
just O
ask O
for O
what O
you H
need O
, O
and O
I'm O
I H
'm O
sure O
they O
will O
do O
their O
best O
to O
be O
hospitable O
. O

OMG O

OMG O
.. O
make O
sure O
to O
book O
a O
reservation N
, O
as O
this O
magical O
place N
is O
packed O
( O
in O
a O
nice O
way N
) O
I H
love O
that O
the O
owner H
walks O
around O
and O
cares O
how O
his O
customers H
feel O
about O
their O
food N
. O

The O
waiters H
are O
like O
no O
other O
... O

My H
waiter H
was O
so O
excellent O
I H
gave O
him O
a O
75 O
% O
tip N
, O
and O
it O
was O
worht O
every O
penny N
.. O

The O
food N
was O
finger N
licking O
the O
bowel N
fantastic O
.. O

I H
just O
discovered O
her O
has O
a O
place N
right O
near O
my H
work N
( O
Color N
me H
Phat O
) O
If O
you H
are O
looking O
for O
a O
romatic O
place N
with O
the O
best O
food N
and O
service N
in O
the O
valley N
Giovanni H
Ristorante O
should O
be O
your H
number N
1 O
+ O
2 O
choice N
. O

Holly H
is O
truely O
the O
best O
hairstylist H
! O

I H
have O
lived O
in O
the O
UTC O
La O
Jolla O
area N
for O
many O
years N
, O
and O
I H
never O
new O
this O
salon N
was O
here O
until O
a O
friend H
reffered O
me H
to O
see O
Holly H
here O
. O

I H
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
my H
experience N
here O
. O

All O
of O
the O
people N
were O
friendly O
and O
welcoming O
. O

I H
got O
highlights O
, O
haircut N
, O
and O
a O
blowdry O
. O

She O
did O
a O
great O
job N
! O

Holly H
is O
very O
experienced O
and O
talented O
, O
and O
I H
could O
tell O
she O
new O
what O
she O
was O
doing O
right O
off O
the O
bat A
. O

My H
hair N
looks O
amazing O
, O
and O
I H
get O
compliments N
all O
the O
time N
. O

I H
deffenitly O
reccomend O
this O
salon N
and O
Holly H
to O
anyone O
. O

You H
will O
not O
be O
disappointed O
!!!!!! O

Outdated O
but O
not O
bad O

So O
I H
really O
felt N
like O
this O
place N
was O
extremely O
outdated O
especially O
since O
the O
pictures N
make O
it O
look O
nice O
and O
modern O
. O

It O
had O
listed O
that O
there O
was O
a O
hot O
breakfast N
but O
all O
this O
meant O
is O
that O
they O
added O
a O
waffle N
maker H
to O
the O
common O
continental O
affair N
at O
most O
cheap O
hotels N
. O

The O
family H
suite N
was O
basically O
two O
rooms N
with O
a O
small O
opening N
between O
them O
which O
worked O
great O
for O
us H
because O
we H
were O
two O
families N
traveling O
together O
. O

If O
you H
are O
in O
town N
and O
need O
that O
kind N
of O
space N
I H
say O
stay O
here O
but O
if O
you H
are O
looking O
for O
a O
little O
more O
upscale O
affair N
don't O
do O
n't O
let O
the O
pictures N
fool H
you H
and O
book O
somewhere O
else O
. O

Great H
, O
and O
probably O
the O
only O
West O
Indian O
spot N
worth N
hitting O
up O
in O
Nashville O
. O

I H
was O
born O
and O
raised O
in O
Toronto O
, O
which O
has O
a O
huge O
West O
Indian O
( O
Trinidadian O
, O
Jamaican O
, O
etc O
) O
population N
. O

So O
huge O
in O
fact N
, O
that O
Toronto O
slang N
is O
influenced O
by O
and O
has O
Jamaican O
references N
, O
and O
Jamaican O
beef N
patties N
are O
staples N
in O
my H
high O
school N
cafeteria N
. O

Anyway O
, O
I H
was O
practically O
raised O
on O
this O
stuff N
, O
and O
being O
a O
connoisseur H
of O
West O
Indian O
cuisine N
, O
Jamaica O
Way O
is O
a O
bit N
toned O
down O
to O
suit N
the O
American O
palette N
. O

All O
you H
have O
to O
do O
to O
make O
it O
authentic O
Jamaican O
food N
, O
is O
add O
a O
whole O
lot N
of O
pepper A
. O

A H
lot N
. O

The O
finest O
Christmas O
Trees A
i've O
i H
've O
ever O
seen O
. O

I H
felt N
like O
I H
was O
in O
heaven N
when O
I H
walked O
through O
the O
majestic O
fields N
of O
this O
particular O
farm N
. O

The O
trees A
were O
in O
magnificent O
shape N
and O
the O
variety N
was O
astounding O
. O

The O
owners H
were O
entertaining O
and O
gracious O
. O

I H
especially O
liked O
the O
Eco O
friendly O
atmosphere N
and O
the O
owners H
owner H
s H
love O
of O
all O
animals A
. O

This O
is O
one N
of O
the O
best O
farms N
I H
have O
ever O
been O
too O
. O

I H
would O
call O
it O
the O
Taj O
Mahal O
of O
the O
east O
coast N
! O

It O
put O
hair N
on O
my H
chest N
and O
thanks N
to O
the O
owners H
owner H
s H
advice N
I H
invested O
vanguard O
, O
got O
myself H
a O
woman H
like O
Jerry H
, O
and O
became O
a O
republican O
. O

Thanks N
Tussey O
Mountain O
Tree O
Plantation O
! O

Pho-nomenal O
!! O

I H
have O
been O
eating O
Pho O
for O
almost O
my H
entire O
life N
and O
I've O
I H
've O
always O
gone O
to O
the O
Pho O
places N
in O
south O
philly O
and O
off O
the O
boulevard N
and O
even O
the O
other O
one N
in O
chinatown O
, O
but O
when O
i H
tried O
this O
pho O
place N
, O
it O
blew O
the O
other O
pho O
houses N
away O
!! O

all O
of O
the O
pho O
places N
taste N
the O
same O
to O
me H
, O
so O
what O
seperates O
one N
from O
the O
other O
is O
the O
service N
and O
the O
price N
. O

The O
service N
here O
is O
incredible O
compared O
to O
the O
other O
places N
. O

the O
only O
down O
fall N
of O
this O
pho O
house N
is O
the O
difficulty N
in O
finding O
parking O
in O
chinatown O
. O

remember O
to O
bring O
cash N
since O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
take O
debit N
or O
credit N
. O

hope O
this O
helps O
!! O

Had O
a O
horrible O
experience N
with O
a O
manager H
here O
, O
Rachel H
McInnis O
, O
she O
was O
rude O
, O
inconsiderate O
and O
did O
not O
do O
the O
right O
thing N
for O
an O
item N
that O
was O
marked O
incorrectly O
... O

I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
interested O
in O
shopping O
in O
a O
place N
with O
people N
like O
her O
... O
she O
refused O
to O
sell O
me H
the O
item N
at O
its O
marked O
price N
even O
after O
admitting O
they O
had O
made O
a O
mistake N
. O

I H
normally O
don't O
do O
n't O
write O
reviews N
but O
seeing O
that O
I H
considered O
Dillards O
a O
distinguished O
, O
upscale O
place N
to O
shop N
, O
this O
one N
won't O
wo O
n't O
be O
getting O
my H
business N
, O
nor O
my H
family's O
family H
's H
, O
nor O
my H
co-workers H
. O

It's O
It O
's H
never O
ok O
to O
let O
a O
customer H
walk O
out H
unhappy O
, O
especially O
when O
they O
are O
right O
. O

Highly O
Recommend O

I H
work N
as O
a O
Transformational O
Life N
Coach H
. O

Since O
this O
is O
an O
alternative O
therapy N
I H
always O
refer O
clients H
to O
a O
lisenced O
therapist H
when O
I H
feel O
that O
is O
appropriate O
. O

I H
found O
her O
through O
a O
colleague H
one N
day N
when O
one N
of O
my H
clients H
was O
in O
the O
midst N
of O
a O
panic O
attack N
and O
needed O
professional O
help O
that O
I H
am O
not O
qualified O
to O
provide O
. O

Little H
did O
I H
know O
that O
I H
would O
soon O
be O
needing O
her O
help O
as O
well O
! O

She O
guided O
me H
through O
a O
very O
difficult O
period N
dealing O
with O
a O
family H
member's O
member N
's H
suicide N
, O
coupled O
with O
elder H
abuse N
. O

I H
found O
her O
to O
be O
extremely O
solid N
, O
kind N
, O
compassionate O
, O
and O
intuitive O
as O
well O
. O

I H
would O
recommend O
her O
highly O
! O

They O
won't O
wo O
n't O
have O
a O
second N
chance N
from O
me H
. O

First O
, O
let O
me H
state N
that O
although O
I H
live O
in O
NYC O
, O
I H
am O
not O
from O
NYC O
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
care N
about O
baseball N
and O
I H
absolutely O
love O
Boston O
to O
death N
( O
so O
beautiful O
, O
so O
clean O
, O
so O
awesome O
) O
. O

That O
said O
, O
I H
hated O
this O
restaurant N
. O

The O
service N
was O
just O
about O
as O
good O
as O
I'd O
I H
'd O
get O
in O
NYC O
( O
that O
means N
it O
was O
poor O
) O
and O
the O
food N
was O
almost O
mediocre O
. O

The O
decor N
left O
a O
lot N
to O
be O
desired O
and O
the O
posters N
telling O
me H
all O
the O
reasons N
99 O
was O
great O
just O
served O
as O
an O
ironic O
contrast N
against O
the O
reality N
. O

Personally O
I H
recommend O
you H
take O
your H
money N
elsewhere O

When O
I H
arrived O
at O
Brickell O
Honda O
on O
6/4/11 O
, O
I H
was O
greeted O
and O
attended O
to O
by O
the O
Sales N
Manager H
, O
Gustavo H
Guerra O
, O
in O
a O
very O
friendly O
and O
professional O
manner N
. O

I H
explained O
to O
him O
what O
I H
wanted O
and O
that O
I H
previously O
went O
to O
Braman O
Honda O
. O

Bramen O
Honda O
was O
a O
bit N
of O
a O
hassle N
. O

He O
told O
me H
" O
no O
problem N
, O
we H
will O
match O
the O
offer O
or O
do O
better O
. O
" O

Mr. N
Guerra O
gave O
me H
a O
better O
deal O
without O
any O
hassles N
nor O
any O
type N
of O
problems N
. O

Brickell O
Honda O
has O
been O
the O
best O
buying O
experience N
in O
the O
world N
. O

I H
urge N
all O
St. O
Thomas H
the O
Apostle O
parishioners H
and O
all O
of O
South O
Florida O
residents H
to O
come O
see O
Gus H
!!! O

Excellent O
customer H
service N
!!! O

Great H
, O
Honest O
Service O

I H
took O
my H
2001 O
Nissan O
Frontier O
in O
to O
fix O
a O
cracked O
manifold N
. O

The O
dealer H
wanted O
$ O
1300 O
to O
fix O
that O
and O
another O
$ O
1500 O
to O
fix O
some O
other O
things N
. O

Eagle O
Transmission O
determined O
that O
much O
of O
the O
work N
the O
dealer H
said O
needed O
to O
be O
done O
was O
unneccesary O
and O
what O
needed O
to O
be O
fixed O
was O
only O
$ O
400 O
!! O

I H
was O
so O
impressed O
with O
the O
honesty N
and O
integrity N
of O
Mike H
and O
everyone O
at O
Eagle O
Transmission O
! O

I H
dropped O
the O
truck N
off O
in O
the O
morning N
and O
it O
was O
ready O
that O
afternoon N
. O

I H
have O
finally O
found O
a O
mechanic H
I H
trust N
!! O

And O
it O
was O
great O
that O
they O
did O
not O
charge O
a O
service N
fee N
to O
diagnose O
the O
problem N
- O
an O
added O
bonus N
!! O

Dr. O
Shady O

Kelly H
hit O
the O
nail N
on O
the O
head N
. O

" O
Dr. O
Shady O
" O
is O
a O
jerk N
. O

After O
the O
way N
she O
spoke O
to O
me H
on O
my H
last O
visit O
, O
I H
will O
not O
be O
returning O
!! O

Good O
luck N
keeping N
business N
with O
that O
stuck O
up O
attitude N
Dr. O
Shady O
. O

You H
have O
just O
lost O
mine H
. O

The O
next O
time N
you H
feel O
like O
being O
condescending O
to O
someone H
, O
it O
is O
not O
going O
to O
be O
me H
!!!!!! O

Dr. O
Shady O
is O
inexperienced O
and O
prideful O
. O

She O
probably O
does O
not O
even O
have O
10 O
% O
of O
the O
knowledge N
that O
some O
of O
the O
other O
EXPERIENCED O
vets H
do O
in O
this O
area N
. O

I H
will O
be O
carefully O
researching O
vets H
before O
I H
take O
my H
dog A
someplace O
else O
. O

Beautifully O
written O
reviews N
Doctor O
, O
but O
completely O
UNTRUE O
. O

Poor O
Experience O

I H
did O
not O
have O
a O
good O
experience N
w O
/ O
Dr. O
Ghassemlou O
. O

During O
the O
session N
, O
he O
demanded O
to O
have O
my H
physical O
address N
, O
which O
I've O
I H
've O
always O
kept O
private O
as O
I H
am O
enrolled O
in O
a O
witness N
protection N
program N
. O

I H
believe O
he O
is O
correct O
in O
that O
he O
needs N
my H
physical O
address N
for O
legal O
reasons N
, O
however O
, O
he O
did O
not O
adequately O
explain O
this O
during O
our H
session N
. O

I H
learned O
more O
about O
this O
doing O
my H
own O
research N
afterward O
. O

I H
think O
he O
could've O
could O
've O
done O
more O
to O
assuage O
my H
concerns O
by O
giving O
me H
concrete O
facts N
. O

Saying O
that O
I H
need O
to O
give O
him O
my H
address N
or O
else O
I H
have O
intimacy N
issues N
is O
not O
helpful O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
pretty O
combative O
actually O
. O

you'll O
you H
'll O
love O
it O

I H
have O
had O
my H
back O
fused O
in O
2 O
places N
. O

I H
wish O
that O
I H
hadn't O
had O
n't O
done O
this O
. O

With O
these O
fusions N
, O
chiropractric N
isn't O
is O
n't O
as O
successful O
, O
but O
it O
still O
is O
very O
helpful O
. O

Even O
after O
my H
fusions N
, O
my H
back O
continued O
to O
hurt O
, O
but O
now O
it O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
hurt O
any O
more O
. O

I H
would O
encourage O
anyone O
who O
is O
thinking O
of O
back O
surgery N
, O
to O
talk O
about O
different O
treatment N
options N
first O
with O
Dr. O
de O
Barros O
. O

He O
really O
knows O
what O
he O
is O
talking O
about O
and O
will O
approach N
the O
different O
options N
fairly O
. O

You H
can O
see O
different O
treatments N
that O
a O
surgeon H
can't O
ca O
n't O
see O
, O
so O
that O
you H
can O
have O
several O
treatment N
options N
before O
you H
decide O
what O
to O
do O
. O

Unbelievably O
huge O
experience N
for O
such O
a O
small O

!!! O

I H
have O
been O

My H
Favorite O
in O
McLean O

My H
family H
loves O
coming O
to O
Endo O
Sushi O
. O
They O
are O
very O
nice O
, O
it O
is O
never O
crowded O
, O
and O
the O
food N
is O
wonderful O
, O
very O
delicious O
and O
fresh O
! O

Sometimes O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
get O
parking O
in O
the O
lot N
in O
front N
of O
the O
storefront N
, O
and O
it O
is O
on O
a O
one N
- O
way N
street N
, O
but O
the O
restaurant N
itself O
is O
NEVER O
overcrowded O
. O

If O
you H
cannot O
can O
not O
park N
in O
the O
lot N
, O
then O
you H
can O
park N
in O
the O
shopping O
center's O
center N
's H
garage N
, O
and O
walk O
up O
to O
Endo O
Sushi O
. O

The O
service N
is O
fast O
. O

Be O
sure O
to O
ring N
the O
little O
bell N
on O
your H
way N
out H
if O
you H
enjoyed O
your H
meal N

( O

the O
hostess H
stand O
) O

Horrible O
Service O
! O

I H

yelled O
at O

yelled O
at O

i H
asked O
if O

up O
my H
car N
5 O
- O
10 O
minutes N
late O
. O

I H
explained O

already O
on O
my H
way N
and O
i H
would O
rush N
to O
get O
there O
as O
soon O
as O
i H
could O
because O
i H
needed O
my H
car N
for O
work N
at O
5 O
am O
, O
but O
the O
guy H
was O
arguing O
with O
me H
saying O
he O
was O
gonna O
gon O
na O
lock O
the O
doors N
right O
at O
5:30 O
. O

Rude O
, O
unprofessional O
, O
just O
jerks H
. O

Seems O
like O
all O
they O
care N
about O
is O
the O
money N
and O
getting O
home N
on O
time N
, O
NO O
care N
for O

AT O

Superb O
Arrangements N

I H
used O
Fancy O
Flowers A
for O
my H
late O
husband's O
husband H
's H
funeral N
flowers A
as O
they O
had O
been O
recommended O
to O
me H
. O

I H
am O
so O
glad O
that O
I H
called O
in O
to O
see O
Ana H
, O
she O
is O
a O
lovely O
girl H
who O
showed O
nothing N
but O
care N
and O
compassion N
towards O
me H
. O

The O
flowers A
were O
all O
that O
I H
hoped O
they O
would O
be O
, O
I H
have O
attended O
several O
funerals N
of O
late O
unfortunately O
and O
the O
flowers A
I H
recieved O
from O
Ana H
outshone O
them O
all O
. O

She O
is O
so O
talented O
, O
the O
flowers A
were O
arranged O
superbly O
and O
delicately O
, O
it O
is O
so O
obvious O
to O
see O
the O
difference N
between O
someone H
fully O
trained O
and O
skilled O
compared O
to O
others O
. O

Thank O
you H
Ana H
I H
hope O
to O
see O
you H
in O
the O
future N
under O
better O
circumstances N
. O

Great H
first O
experience N
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
22 O
, O
and O
my H
hairdresser H
was O
great O
( O
and O
not O
" O
old O
" O
like O
one N
of O
the O
reviews N
says O
) O
- O
she O
really O
listened O
to O
what O
I H
wanted O
and O
gave O
me H
tons N
of O
tips N
on O
how O
to O
style N
my H
hair N
so O
I H
could O
get O
it O
to O
look O
the O
way N
I H
wanted O
it O
to O
. O

She O
deep O
conditioned O
my H
hair N
and O
took O
the O
time N
to O
style N
it O
properly O
. O

She O
recommended O
products N
but O
absolutely O
didn't O
did O
n't O
pressure O
me H
to O
buy O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
a O
cute O
place N
with O
a O
really O
friendly O
, O
laid O
- O
back O
atmosphere N
. O

I H
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O
and O
will O
be O
going O
back O
for O
my H
next O
haircut N
. O

Oh O
! O

And O
students H
get O
$ O
5 O
off O
, O
can't O
ca O
n't O
argue O
with O
that O
. O

Smokers O
Smoker H
s H
Haven N

Yeah O
, O
this O
complex O
is O
not O
very O
good O
. O

Our H
bathroom N
fan N
, O
one N
electric O
outlet N
and O
2 O
leaky O
sinks N
have O
yet O
to O
be O
fixed O
. O

Both O
bathrooms N
look O
like O
they O
were O
flooded O
and O
the O
wood N
cabinets N
are O
thrashed O
at O
the O
bottom N
and O
they O
slapped O
some O
pieces N
of O
wood N
over O
to O
try O
to O
cover O
it O
up O
. O

And O
non-smokers O
beware O
!!! O

I H
think O
90 O
percent N
of O
the O
tenants H
are O
smokers H
! O

If O
you H
do O
not O
smoke O
, O
do O
not O
move O
here O
. O

Our H
unit N
reeks O
of O
old O
cigarette N
smoke O
and O
it O
started O
to O
become O
apparent O
a O
few O
weeks N
after O
we H
moved O
in O
. O

You H
cannot O
can O
not O
walk O
5 O
feet N
without O
smelling O
that O
disgusting O
cigarette N
smoke O
and O
it O
blows O
right O
into O
the O
windows N
all O
day N
and O
all O
night N
. O

Great H
Sanwiches N
, O
Great H
Prices N

I H
used O
to O
go O
here O
almost O
every O
day N
since O
I H
work N
in O
the O
neighbourhood N
and O
loved O
their O
turkey A
and O
meatball N
sandwiches N
. O

Chicken N
salad N
salad N
is O
great O
too O
. O

Best O
of O
all O
, O
the O
staff N
is O
quick O
on O
their O
feet N
and O
even O
with O
long O
lines N
, O
usually O
serve O
you H
in O
5 O
minutes N
or O
less O
. O

For O
the O
quality N
, O
the O
prices N
( O
$ O
4 O
- O
$ O
6 O
) O
have O
to O
be O
the O
best O
in O
town N
. O

The O
staff N
get O
to O
know O
regulars H
and O
do O
their O
job N
very O
well O
. O

Tourists H
like O
the O
other O
reviewer H
might O
not O
appreciate O
their O
efficiency N
or O
quality N
, O
but O
I H
certainly O
do O
. O

This O
isn't O
is O
n't O
a O
TGIF O
or O
Cafe O
, O
its O
it O

a O
lunch N
sandwich N
place N
and O
a O
good O
one N

The O
pastor H
at O
this O
church N
is O
cool O

I H
met O
him O
after O
some O
holiday N
service N

He O
had O
a O
robe N
that O

made O
back O
in O
the O
'60s O

God H

Dan H

and O
learning O
more O
about O
how O
the O
springs N
are O

I H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
send O
my H
dogs A
there O
. O

I H
had O
a O
conversation N
with O
the O
woman H
running O
this O
place N
in O
April O
2010 O
. O

She O
basically O
said O
if O
the O
children H
getting O
off O
the O
bus N
aren't O
are O
n't O
paying O
to O
enter O
her O
building N
she O
was O
going O
to O
let O
them O
wander O
around O
the O
streets N
. O

Wow O
, O
really O
? O

With O
all O
the O
child H
predators A
out H
there O
, O
a O
busy O
road N
, O
cars N
speeding O
by O
...... O
and O
you H
are O
going O
to O
let O
some O
4 O
/ O
5 O
year N
olds N
wonder O
around O
cause N
you're H
you H
're O
money N
hungry O
? O

REAL O
CHRISTIAN O
OF O
YOU H
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! O

Whether O
they O
pay O
me H
or O
not O
, O
if O
their O
parents H
get O
into O
an O
accident N
, O
stuck O
in O
traffic N
, O
etc. O
THE O
LAST O
THING N
I H
WOULD O
DO O
IS O
LET O
A H
CHILD H
GET O
RAPED O
BECAUSE O
I H
WASN'T O
WAS O
N'T O
PAID O
. O

Excellent O
service N

I H
could O
easily O
go O
to O
Nordstrom O
for O
my H
designer H
jeans N
and O
pay O
the O
same O
price N
, O
but O
I H
go O
to O
the O
Garment O
District O
for O
their O
service N
. O

Previous O
reviewers H
said O
they O
were O
pushy O
and O
I H
can O
understand O
that O
, O
but O
I H
find O
the O
staff N
more O
helpful O
than O
anything O
else O
. O

Tiffany H
is O
fabulous O
! O

I H
came O
in O
for O
alterations N
( O
free O
, O
by O
the O
way N
) O
and O
told O
her O
about O
a O
stain N
I H
had O
on O
my H
new O
leather N
purse N
. O

She O
immediately O
went O
to O
the O
back O
, O
brought O
out H
leather N
cleaner N
and O
cleaned O
my H
purse N
on O
the O
spot N
. O

I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
even O
buy O
the O
bag N
there O
! O

Huge O
selection N
and O
, O
great O
suggestions N
from O
the O
staff N
and O
they O
refer O
you H
to O
reliable O
places N
if O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
what O
you H
need O
. O

We H
were O
expecting O
a O
great O
experience N
, O
when O
we H
recieved O
a O
friendly O
greeting N
by O
the O
hosts O
. O

The O
atmosphere N
was O
nice O
and O
very O
clean O
. O

The O
menu N
had O
plenty O
of O
options N
even O
for O
picky O
eaters H
. O

The O
service N
was O
ok O
, O
our H
waitress H
kept O
forgetting O
our H
drinks N
even O
though O
we H
reminded O
her O
several O
times N
. O

To O
start O
we H
tried O
the O
guacamole N
and O
salsa N
verde O
, O
it O
was O
completly O
flavorless O
. O

We H
should O
have O
left O
then O
. O

We H
orderd O
our H
meals N
anyway O
, O
chimichangas O
, O
jalapeno A
borritos N
, O
and O
quesadillas N
. O

Everything O
was O
bland O
, O
completely O
void O
of O
any O
spice N
or O
flavor N
. O

We H
have O
never O
had O
mexican O
food N
this O
bad O
, O
it O
was O
just O
simply O
gross O
. O

Hopefully O
they O
spice N
things N
up O
or O
they O
wont O
wo O
nt O
be O
in O
business N
long O
. O

I H
recommend O

Might O
try O
again O

minutes N
from O
ordering O
to O
eating O
. O

Half O
the O

were O
empty O
by O
this O
point N
. O

Other O
Thoughts N
: O
Will O
try O
this O
place N
again O
. O

There O
must O
be O
a O
reason N
so O
many O
people N
like O
it O
there O
. O

Their O
Club O
sandwich N
looks O
tasty O
, O
maybe O
that'll O
that O
'll O
change O
my H
mind N
.... O
and O
a O
different O
server H
. O

very O
professional O
/ O
very O
helpful O

the O
people N
at O
Fidelity O
Leasing O
were O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
. O

i H
was O
looking O
for O
a O
car N
but O
did O
not O
really O
know O
what O
i H
wanted O
and O
they O
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
took O
the O
time N
to O
first O
figure O
out H
what O
my H
needs N
were O
and O
showing O
me H
various O
options N
to O
meet O
those O
needs N
. O

they O
seemed O
more O
interested O
in O
helping O
me H
find O
the O
right O
car N
rather O
then O
just O
make O
a O
sale N
. O

my H
experience N
with O
them O
was O
great O
- O
low O
stress N
, O
very O
helpful O
and O
very O
personal O
. O

after O
finding O
the O
car N
i H
wanted O
they O
took O
the O
time N
to O
go O
over O
each O
step O
and O
making O
it O
as O
painless O
as O
possible O
. O

from O
start O
to O
finish O
they O
were O
top N
notch N
. O

i H
would O
highly O
recommend O
calling O
these O
people N
up O
for O
your H
next O
car N
. O

This O
insurance N
co. O
Is O
a O
joke N
!!! O

They O
have O
absolutely O
no O
communication N
skills N
whatsoever O
. O

if O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
mind N
being O
robbed O
, O
cheated O
or O
lied O
to O
then O
this O
is O
the O
company N
for O
you H
. O

They O
will O
make O
every O
attempt N
to O
misinform O
and O
misrepresent O
themselves O
. O

They O
make O
up O
excuses N
in O
hopes N
to O
confuse O
their O
policy N
holders H
with O
misinformation N
. O

as O
an O
example N
they O
took O
payment N
for O
5 O
out H
of O
6 O
monthly O
plan N
premiums N
for O
a O
yearly O
policy N
and O
cancelled O
the O
contract N
for O
the O
remainder N
of O
the O
policy N
for O
reasons N
they O
stated O
was O
not O
receiving O
information N
on O
other O
licensed O
drivers N
in O
the O
household N
? O

I H
personally O
provided O
the O
request N
on O
four O
separate O
occasions N
and O
they O
claim O
there O
is O
a O
glitch N
in O
their O

Fantastic O
Service O
! O

I H
have O
been O
here O
a O
few O
times N
for O
oil N
changes N
and O
just O
got O
my H
tires N
, O
alignment N
and O
state N
inspection N
done O
yesterday N
. O

I H
shopped O
it O
around O
and O
they O
were O
extremely O
competitive O
in O
pricing N
and O
also O
added O
nitrogen N
to O
my H
tires N
which O
should O
extend O
the O
life N
and O
get O
me H
better O
gas N
mileage N
. O

It O
also O
came O
with O
free O
balance O
and O
rotation N
for O
the O
life N
of O
the O
tires N
! O

What O
made O
it O
perfect O
was O
that O
they O
offered O
transportation N
so O
that O
I H
would O
not O
have O
to O
wait N
there O
or O
take O
time N
off O
of O
work N
to O
go O
back O
and O
forth O
or O
try O
to O
find O
a O
ride O
. O

Great H
service N
, O
great O
pricing N
and O
SUPER O
CONVENIENT O

I H
also O
did O
not O
feel O
like O
they O
tried O
to O
sell O
me H
a O
bunch N
of O
services N
that O
I H
did O
not O
need O
. O

Great H

I H

Not O
once O
did O
I H
feel O

to O
like O
they O
actually O
cared O
about O
what O
I H
wanted O
, O
all O
they O
were O
interested O
in O

me H
signing O
a O

right O
then O
and O
there O
. O

Very O
high O
pressured O
sales N
and O
with O
the O
reviews N
of O
many O
others O
bad O

. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
glad O
I H
trusted O
my H
gut N

didn't O
did O
n't O
get O
sucked O
into O

Don't O
Do O

I H
took O
my H
3 O
year N

son H
here O
at O
the O
weekend N
and O
to O
be O
honest O
, O
apart O
from O
the O

I H
thought O
it O
was O
rubbish N

overpriced O

Even O
taking O
into O
account O
the O
fact N
that O
my H
3 O
year N
old O
wanted O
to O
run O
most O
of O
the O
way N
round O
, O
it O
took O
us H
just O
over O
one N
hour N
start O

If O
you H
have O
been O
to O
the O
London O

I H
would O
not O
even O
bother O
with O
this O

If O

are O
willing O
to O
shell N
out H
the O

part N

go O

I H
could O

recommend O
Dr O

enough O

I H
had O
a O
severe O
phobia N

I H
met O

was O
treated O
by O
Dr O

He O

After O
my H
trees A

cleaned O
up O
, O
they O
gave O
me H
a O

The O

that O
it O

the O

salsa N
I H
would O

he O
was O
right O

alone O
had O
pets A
go O
to O
Dr. O
Mann H
for O
surgical O
procedures N
and O
came O
back O
dead O
. O

If O
you H
take O
him O
here O
for O
shots N
, O
no O
big O
deal O
but O
I H
would O
never O
let O
this O
man H
apply O
anesthetic N
to O
my H
pet A
ever O
again O
. O

Oh O
, O
they O
also O
charged O
me H
for O
the O
procedure N
( O
$ O
250 O
) O
AND O
had O
the O
audacity N
to O
charge O
me H
a O
$ O
25 O
' O
DISPOSAL N
' O
fee N
. O

They O
actually O
itemized O
it O
as O
a O
DISPOSAL N
fee N
. O

AVOID O
AT O
ALL O
COSTS N
. O

One O
of O
the O
worst O
places N

This O
place N
and O
its O
sister H
store N
Peking O
Garden O
are O
the O
worst O
places N
to O
order O
from O
. O

the O
food N
was O
horrible O
not O
cooked O
like O
it O
should O
be O
, O
they O
got O
the O
order O
wrong O
on O
a O
number N
of O
occasions N
, O
and O
once O
forgot O
about O
my H
order O
. O

i H
had O
to O
call O
back O
up O
there O
two O
hours N
later O
and O
the O
lady H
( O
who O
claimed O
to O
be O
a O
manager H
) O
said O
my H
food N
was O
on O
the O
way N
, O
and O
she O
didnt O
did O
nt O
offer O
to O
compensate O
me H
in O
any O
kind N
of O
way N
. O

i H
waited O
another O
30 O
mins N
before O
receiving O
my H
food N
and O
it O
was O
cold O
. O

in O
my H
opinon N
this O
place N
should O
be O
shut O
down O
by O
the O
health N
inspector H
, O
and O
anyone O
who O
is O
satisfied O
with O
there O
service N
and O
food N
has O
never O
eaten O
at O
a O
real O
asian O
restaurant N
. O

Gone O
downhill O
since O
change O
in O
ownership N

Sigh O
. O

I H
used O
to O
LOVE O
this O
place N
. O

But O
now O
that O
they O
are O
part N
of O
a O
chain N
, O
service N
has O
slipped O
. O

I H
am O
waiting O
longer O
at O
BNA O
for O
my H
pickups N
and O
last O
time N
I H
parked O
with O
them O
, O
they O
lost O
my H
car N
key N
. O

Lucky O
I H
had O
a O
spare O
with O
me H
! O

To O
date N
they O
have O
not O
made O
good O
by O
either O
finding O
the O
key N
or O
paying O
for O
a O
new O
one N
. O

( O
These O
new O
car N
keys N
are O
EXPENSIVE O
to O
copy N
, O
you H
can't O
ca O
n't O
just O
go O

to O
the O

day N

it O
may O
be O
cheaper O

at O
BNA O

This O

They O
convince O
lots N

when O
in O

they O

a O
very O

, O
they O
are O
just O
another O
big O

They O

the O
public O
welfare N

Never O
again O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
go O
here O
unless O
you H
want O
to O
sit O
, O
order O
, O
eat O
and O
be O
asked O
to O
leave O
all O
in O
a O
matter N
of O
20 O
minutes N
. O

You H
won't O
wo O
n't O
even O
have O
time N
to O
read O
the O
entire O
menu N
before O
being O
asked O
to O
order O
and O
if O
you H
ask O
for O
more O
time N
your H
server H
will O
wait N
at O
the O

. O

This O
is O
the O
only O
place N
I H
have O
ever O
eaten O
and O
been O
told O
to O
leave O
because O
other O
people N
were O
waiting O
. O

I H
was O
told O
to O
take O
my H
coffee N
to O
go O
if O
I H
wanted O
to O
finish O
it O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
their O
liquor N
license N
was O
expired O
so O
no O
Bloody O
Mary H
or O
Mimosas A
. O

Plus O
the O
drinks N
are O
self O
service N
, O
have O
fun O
trying O
to O
negotiate O
the O
small O
cafeteria N
space N
to O
get O
your H
coffee N
, O
juice N
or O
water N
. O

Go O
next O
door N
to O
the O
Ball O
Square O
Cafe O
instead O
. O

I H
guess O
you H
get O
what O
you H
pay O
for O
. O

I H
tried O
to O
stay O
here O
for O
a O
few O
nights N
with O
my H
girlfriend H
, O
so O
we H
asked O
for O
a O
single O
queen H
bed N
. O

We H
got O
there O
, O
and O
we H
were O
treated O
to O
the O
free O
" O
upgrade N
" O
of O
a O
room N
with O
two O
double O
beds N
. O

Since O
they O
consider O
this O
an O
upgrade N
, O
they O
let O
their O
other O
rooms N
fill O
up O
and O
would O
not O
change O
our H
room N
. O

Then O
we H
got O
put O
in O
a O
room N
with O
a O
huge O
gap N
under O
the O
door N
.... O
right O
next O
to O
the O
ice N
machine N
. O

We H
could O
hear O
every O
single O
thing N
that O
happened O
outside O
like O
it O
was O
inside O
our H
room N
. O

When O
I H
finally O
found O
someone H
at O
the O
desk N
who O
could O
speak O
English O
, O
they O
moved O
our H
room N
, O
but O
we H
still O
did O
not O
receive O
the O
single O
queen H
we H
had O
" O
reserved O
" O

I H
was O
thoroughly O
impressed O
! O

I H
had O
a O
problem N
with O
the O
tile N
in O
my H
bathroom N
coming O
apart O
. O

I H
called O
a O
few O
different O
businesses N
in O
the O
area N
to O
get O
estimates O
, O
they O
weren't O
were O
n't O
the O
cheapest O
I H
found O
but O
very O
reasonable O
. O

The O
best O
part N
is O
I H
got O
my H
whole O
bathroom N
remodeled O
for O
about O
the O
same O
price N
the O
other O
company's N
were O
quoting O
just O
to O
fix O
the O
shower N
tile N
and O
fixtures N
. O

They O
had O
the O
work N
done O
in O
about O
half O
the O
time N
quoted O
which O
made O
me H
and O
my H
wife H
extremely O
happy O
. O

We H
have O
had O
nothing N
but O
compliments N
on O
our H
bathroom N
when O
guest H
come O
over O
- O
who O
would O
have O
guessed O
that O
one N
? O

Very O
nice O
work N
and O
friendly O
guys H
too O
. O

Best O
money N
I've O
I H
've O
spent O
on O
remodeling O
ever O
. O

I H
highly O
recommend O
any O
one N
considering O
home N
repair N
to O
give O
these O
guys H
a O
call O

We H
have O
attended O
A H
Ward O
Dance O
Centre N
for O
over O
a O
year N
and O
really O
enjoy O
the O
friendly O
and O
welcoming O
way N
we H
are O
taught O
Ballroom N
and O
Latin O
as O
well O
as O
the O
fun O
filled O
social O
dance O
evening N
held O
every O
Saturday O
evening N
.... O

It O
is O
not O
really O
possible O
to O
score N
this O
school N
too O
highly O
, O
We H
would O
give O
it O
12 O
out H
of O
10 O
and O

Stars H

Steve H
& O
Anne H

I H
purchased O
a O
2 O
- O
year N
old O
certified O
pre-owned O
BMW O
from O
this O
dealership N
. O

The O
night N
I H
drove O
back O
home N
, O
I H
found O
that O
the O
rear O
window N
has O
some O
leakage N
. O

( O
You H
can O
hear O
the O
wind N
while O
driving O
on O
highway N
. O

Very O
likely O
it O
needs N
a O
new O
window N
seal O
) O
. O

I H
admit O
that O
I H
should O
have O
paid O
attention N
to O
this O
kind N
of O
little O
things N
while O
test N
drive O
. O

( O
But O
this O
is O
a O
certified O
car N
from O
a O
dealer H
. O
) O

So O
I H
brought O
the O
car N
back O
the O
second N
day N
. O

They O
told O
me H
that O
this O
is O
not O
under O
warranty N
and O
want O
to O
charge O
me H
$ O
175 O
just O
to O
diagnose O
the O
problem N
! O

Who O
knows O
how O
much O
they O
want O
me H
to O
pay O
to O
fix O
this O
thing N
. O

I H
walked O
away O
. O

So O
my H
advice N
is O
that O
NEVER O
TRUST O
THIS O
DEALER H
. O

STAY O
AWAY O
AS O
FAR O
AS O
POSSIBLE O
. O

Perfect O
Practice O

After O
I H
had O
chosen O
The O
Fountain O
Dental O
Practice O
they O
provided O
a O
slick O
and O
professional O
service N
from O
start O
to O
finish O
. O

Everyone O
was O
friendly O
from O
the O
receptionist H
to O
the O
surgeon H
herself O
, O
putting O
me H
at O
my H
ease N
and O
explaining O
the O
whole O
process N
, O
both O
initially O
and O
then O
as O
we H
went O
along O
. O

Surgery N
visit O
timings N
were O
always O
made O
to O
suit N
me H
and O
not O
them O
and O
they O
gave O
me H
the O
feeling O
that O
I H
mattered O
and O
was O
important O
to O
them O
. O

The O
surgery N
itself O
is O
slick O
, O
modern O
and O
very O
relaxed O
and O
I H
always O
felt N
that O
I H
was O
in O
capable O
hands N
. O

My H
dental O
surgeon H
, O
Dr. O
Lucy H
Nichols H
is O
clearly O
a O
dental O
perfectionist H
and O
clearly O
proud O
both O
of O
the O
work N
she O
does O
and O
the O
reputation N
she O
has O
established O
. O

Everyone O
was O
so O
helpful O
that O
I H
cannot O
can O
not O
wait N
to O
go O
back O

Wonderful O
service N
for O
large O
group N

I H
had O
my H
wedding N
luncheon N
at O
this O
BJs O
BJ O
s H
restaurant N
, O
and O
it O
was O
one N
of O
the O
best O
choices N
that O
I H
made O
. O

It O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
-- O
we H
paid O
a O
certain O
amount N
per O
person H
, O
and O
my H
husband H
and O
I H
chose O
4 O
types N
of O
pizza N
and O
the O
servers H
brought O
out H
as O
much O
as O
we H
wanted O
. O

We H
were O
also O
served O
salad N
and O
soda N
. O

We H
had O
a O
large O
party N
, O
about O
fifty O
people N
or O
so O
, O
and O
yet O
everything O
was O
served O
quickly O
and O
we H
all O
had O
a O
wonderful O
time N
. O

Even O
though O
we H
were O
only O
supposed O
to O
have O
those O
specific O
types N
of O
pizza N
, O
when O
guests H
asked O
for O
a O
different O
type N
, O
it O
was O
brought O
out H
with O
no O
charge O
to O
us H
! O

I H
really O
appreciate O
BJs O
BJ O
s H
for O
making O
that O
special O
day N
even O
better O
with O
their O
wonderful O
food N
and O
service N
. O

wonderful O

I H
went O
to O
ohm O
after O
reading O
some O
of O
the O
reviews N
. O

I H
go O
to O
school N
in O
the O
area N
and O
usually O
wait N
until O
I H
go O
home N
to O
get O
my H
hair N
cut O
. O

I H
decided O
it O
was O
time N
to O
grow O
up O
and O
made O
an O
appointment N
. O

Sierra H
was O
my H
stylist H
and O
i H
love O
what O
she O
did O
. O

I H
have O
wavy O
hair N
and O
she O
cut O
to O
my H
hair N
style N
. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
time N
i H
had O
left O
a O
salon N
with O
my H
hair N
curly O
. O

Usually O
they O
blow O
dry H
it O
out H
and O
i H
have O
to O
wait N
until O
i H
wash O
it O
to O
see O
what O
it O
will O
look O
like O
in O
its O
natural O
state N
. O

But O
she O
did O
a O
fabulous O
job N
letting O
me H
know O
what O
she O
was O
doing O
at O
all O
times N
and O
styled O
my H
hair N
in O
a O
way N
i H
could O
do O
it O
at O
home N
. O

It O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
completly O
impossible O
!!!! O

I H
am O
definitely O
going O
back O

After O
recently O
relocating O
to O
South O
Bend O
, O
we H
were O
looking O
for O
a O
delicious O
, O
fun O
, O
yet O
elegant O
establishment N
for O
New H
Years N
Year O
s H
Eve O
dinner N
. O

We H
were O
disappointed O
with O
this O
holiday N
dinner N
due O
to O
the O
overall O
flavor N
and O
price N
of O
the O
meal N
, O
and O
accessibility N
to O
the O
Jazz O
Club O
. O

The O
meal N
was O
extremely O
overpriced O
and O
lacked O
flavor N
, O
especially O
for O
being O
a O
special O
NYE O
menu N
. O

The O
limited O
menu N
had O
few O
appetizing O
options N
and O
the O
NYE O
special O
packages N
were O
way N
overpriced O
. O

After O
our H
meal N
, O
our H
server H
found O
us H
a O
table N
in O
the O
jazz N
club N
where O
we H
were O
informed O
it O
would O
be O
another O
$ O
10 O
/ O
person H
to O
stay O
and O
listen O
to O
the O
band N
, O
despite O
the O
fact N
we H
had O
just O
finished O
a O
dinner N
there O
and O
were O
intending O
to O
enjoy O
their O
drink N
list N

This O
was O
a O
less O

impressive O
experience N

you'll O
you H

better O

One O
night N
was O
too O
much O
. O

First O
room N
had O
used O
tissues N
next O
to O
the O
bed N
and O
I H
requested O
it O
be O
rectified O
. O

I H
was O
then O
moved O
to O
another O
room N
around O
the O
back O
where O
the O
room N
was O
dirty O
, O
the O
shower N
was O
dirty O
with O
other O
peoples N
people N
s H
hair N
in O
it O
, O
the O
toilet N
seat N
was O
peeling O
and O
rough O
and O
the O
bathroom N
was O
full O
of O
mould N
. O

I H
called O
reception N
to O
ask O
if O
they O
knew O
the O
state N
the O
room N
was O
in O
and O
was O
told O
" O
This O
is O
a O
Days O
Inn N
, O
not O
the O
Hilton O
" O
and O
the O
receptionist H
then O
hung O
up O
on O
me H
. O

To O
warn O
you H
to O
stay O
away O
from O
this O
place N
just O
isn't O
is O
n't O
enough O
. O

There O
was O
not O
one N
ounce N
of O
caring O
involved O
and O
anyone O
I H
can O
warn O
about O
the O
complete O
lack N

Before O

on O

We H
were O
having O
a O
major O
problem N
in O
maintaining O
cash N
. O

Being O
a O
grocery N

, O
maintaining O
5000 O
different O

was O
a O
challenging O
job N

Managing O

was O
really O
a O
tough O
time N
. O

How O

these O

FusionRetail O

This O
is O
by O
far O
the O
BEST O
B&B O
that O
we H
have O
ever O
stayed O
at O
! O

We H
were O
in O
Santa O
Fe O
for O
a O
special O
event N
and O
our H
hosts O
rented O
out H
the O
El H
Paradero O
for O
all O
their O
guests H
to O
stay O
at O
. O

We H
could O
not O
have O
been O
more O
welcomed O
, O
more O
comfortable O
or O
more O
well O
fed O
. O

The O
weekend N
was O
perfect O
in O
every O
way N
, O
in O
large O
part N
to O
Sue H
and O
her O
great O
staff N
. O

Everyone O
was O
so O
friendly O
and O
really O
went O
out H
of O
their O
way N
to O
make O
sure O
everything O
went O
well O
. O

We H
can O
not O
wait N
to O
go O
back O
to O
Santa O
Fe O
and O
to O
this O
great O
B&B O
... O
especially O
my H
4 O
year N
old O
, O
who O
made O
friends H
with O
Ms. O
Sue H
and O
all O
the O
ladies H
, O
and O
has O
talked O
about O
them O
since O
we H
left O
! O

We H
would O
highly O
recommend O
the O
El H
Paradero O
on O
your H
next O
trip N
to O
Santa O
Fe O
! O

Disatisfied O
customer H
, O
I H
went O
through O
Kitchen H
Aid O
and O
used O
one N
of O
their O
recommended O
vendors H
. O

A&E O
came O
out H
, O
charged O
$ O
129 O
fee N
just O
to O
walk O
in O
the O
door N
. O

I H
needed O
a O
part N
for O
my H
appliance N
, O
the O
cost O
was O
very O
high O
so O
I H
said O
never O
mind N
, O
paid O
the O
fee N
and O
called O
a O
local O
business N
for O
a O
second N
quote N
. O

The O
second N
vendor H
charged O
$ O
55 O
( O
less O
than O
half O
of O
what O
A&E O
charges N
) O
to O
come O
and O
applied O
that O
to O
the O
price N
of O
the O
repair N
service N
( O
which O
A&E O
does O
not O
) O
. O

Their O
quote N
came O
in O
at O
half O
the O
price N
of O
A&E O
for O
the O
same O
work N
and O
same O
part N
. O

Seems O
to O
me H
like O
A&E O
charges N
way N
more O
than O
necessary O
! O

Very O
disappointed O
in O
Kitchen H
Aid O
as O
well O
, O
I H
thought O
that O
they O
pre-screened O
their O
vendors H
for O
price N
and O
quality N
of O
work N
, O
obviously O
they O
do O
not O
! O

Lovely O
Nails O
on O
Cayuga O
St. O
in O
Lewiston O
, O
NY O

First O
let O
me H
start O
out H
by O
saying O
, O
that O
I H
have O
had O
very O
nice O
pedicures N
at O
Lovely O
Nails O
on O
Military O
Road O
. O

I H
was O
very O
excited O
that O
a O
salon N
was O
opening N
in O
Lewiston O
, O
as O
I H
live O
in O
Youngstown O
. O

I H
was O
in O
two O
weeks N
ago O
and O
had O
the O
worst O
pedicure N
that O
I H
have O
had O
in O
my H
life N
. O

There O
were O
four O
of O
us H
and O
I H
was O
taken O
first O
by O
a O
gentleman H
. O

I H
put O
my H
foot N
in O
the O
water N
and O
it O
was O
cool O
. O

He O
did O
warm O
it O
up O
. O

He O
also O
hurt O
my H
toes N
will O
pushing O
my H
cuticles N
back O
. O

If O
the O
pedicure N
lasted O
20 O
mins. O
, O
that O
was O
a O
stretch O
. O

The O
other O
ladies H
had O
a O
similar O
experience N
, O
both O
had O
nail N
polish N
on O
a O
couple N
of O
toes N
. O

None O
of O
us H
will O
be O
using O
their O
services N
again O
, O
which O
is O
a O
shame N
. O

Good O
Service O
- O
Limited O
Results N

Andrew H
was O
helpful O
and O
knowledgeable O
about O
acupuncture N
re O
: O
infertility N
. O

He O
was O
willing O
to O
talk O
to O
me H
about O
my H
specific O
issues N
and O
develop O
a O
plan N
of O
action N
. O

The O
office N
is O
shared O
with O
a O
foot N
doctor H
and O
it's O
it O
's H
very O
sterile O
and O
medical O
feeling O
, O
which O
I H
liked O
. O

The O
down O
side N
was O
that O
sometimes O
there O
was O
a O
lot N
of O
noise N
in O
the O
hallway N
from O
other O
patients H
/ O
doctors H
. O

I H
worked O
with O
Andrew H
for O
2 O
months N
and O
did O
acupuncture N
and O
herbs A
. O

The O
sessions N
were O
nice O
and O
I H
felt N
relaxed O
after O
them O
but O
did O
not O
notice O
any O
changes N
with O
my H
cycles N
. O

I H
know O
it O
can O
take O
awhile O
a O
while O
for O
results N
and O
didn't O
did O
n't O
expect O
a O
miracle N
, O
but O
after O
2 O
months N
I H
felt N
like O
it O
was O
not O
entirely O
worth N
the O
cost O
/ O
time N
. O

( O
I H
am O
also O
a O
little O
suspicious O
of O
all O
these O
glowing O
reviews N
... O
) O

Friendly O
, O
clean O
and O
excellent O
location N

The O
staff N
was O
very O
helpful O
, O
and O
gave O
us H
good O
advice N
on O
day N
and O
night N
time N

. O

Common O

very O
good O

– O

A H
great O
breakfast N
which O
was O
included O
every O

; O
yummy O
fresh O
Parisian O

Comfortable O
and O
clean O

, O
a O
bit N
noisy O
when O
people N
were O
coming O
in O
late O
from O
a O
night N
out H
, O
but O
we H
didn't O
did O
n't O
mind N
too O
much O
as O
we H
were O
also O
just O
coming O
in O
from O
a O
night N
out H
! O

The O
location N
is O
really O
stellar O
! O

It O
is O
next O
to O
Gare O
du O
Nord O
and O
a O
five O
minute O
walk O
to O
Sacre O
Coeur O
which O
is O
excellent O
for O
shopping O
. O

It O
is O
close O
to O
bus N
lines N
for O
Opera O
Plaza O
, O
Galleries O
Lafayette O
, O
and O
the O
famous O
flea A
Market N

We H
really O
enjoyed O
our H

would O
definitely O
stay O
at O
the O
Vintage O

again O
. O

Just O

Thank O

Was O
fast O
and O
easy O

Just O
had O
our H

returned O
this O
morning N
, O
I H
would O
recommend O
these O
Mobile O
Mechanics H
for O
sure O
. O

They O
certainly O
know O
what O
they O
are O
doing O
. O

The O
mechanic H
came O
to O
our H
place N
and O
sorted O
out H
our H
cars N
car N
s H
problems N
, O
he O
explained O
the O
problem N
and O
was O
very O
up O
front N
and O
honest O
, O
it O
was O
towed O
to O
the O
workshop N
as O
the O
gearbox N
was O
not O
working O
( O
he O
explained O
it O
better O
) O
. O

They O
phoned O
the O
same O
day N
, O
confirmed O
it O
was O
the O
gearbox N
quoted O
me H
the O
job N
, O
I H
gave O
the O
go O
ahead O
. O

Now O
my H
cars N
car N
s H
gears N
and O
brakes N
have O
never O
run O
so O
well O
... O
ever O
its O
it O
s H
like O
driving O
a O
new O
car N
. O

So O
yes O
, O
I H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
hesitate O
in O
recommending O
the O
team N
at O
Just O
Autos O
for O
easy O
professional O
car N
repairs N
, O
Thank O
you H
Just O

I H
stopped O
in O
today N
@ O
Yards O
Brewery O
. O

I H
must O
say O
, O
I H
was O
impressed O
with O
the O
size N
of O
the O
bar N
area N
and O
lounge N
, O
& O
I H
liked O
that O
you H
could O
see O
the O

right O
thru O
the O
glass N
! O

I H
had O
a O
sampler H
of O
IPA O
, O

& O
ESA O
. O

All O

, O
& O
I H
had O
a O
Dogwood A
Grilled O
Cheese N
which O
was O
enjoyable O
with O
the O
fine O
beers N
. O

After O
my H
sampler H
& O
sandwich N
, O
I H
asked O
for O
a O
pint N
of O
there O
Nitrogen O
Love N
Stout O
, O
I H
must O
say O
I H
was O
impressed O

Oil O
Change N
Disaster N

My H
wife H
had O
taken O
her O
'07 O
Ford O
Fusion O
in O
for O
a O
routine N
oil N
change O
. O

A H
couple N
days N
after O
the O
oil N
change O
, O
the O
engine N
ran O
rough O
, O
the O
low O
oil N
pressure O
light N
would O
come O
on O
sporadically O
, O
and O
the O
engine N
would O
whir O
loudly O
. O

Turns O
out H
the O
engine N
had O
no O
oil N
, O
and O
when O
oil N
was O
put O
it O
, O
it O
would O
just O
run O
out H
of O
the O
filter N
. O

There O
could O
have O
( O
hopefully O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
have O
) O
major O
damage N
to O
the O
engine N
. O

All O
of O
this O
started O
after O
their O
oil N
change O
. O

Once O
they O
realized O
their O
mistake N
they O
sent O
a O
mechanic H
and O
tow N
truck N
to O
my H
wife's O
wife H
's H
work N
and O
towed O
it O
back O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

I H
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
shop N
for O
anything O
, O
not O
even O
something O
as O
simple O
as O
an O
oil N
change O
. O

Plus O
they O
will O
overcharge O
you H
for O
just O
about O
everything O
, O
and O
smile O
while O
doing O
it O
. O

Liars H
, O
negative O
stars N
! O

Took O
my H
Cruze O
in O
twice O
for O
poor O
fuel N
economy N
. O

The O
first O
time N
they O
claimed O
to O
get O
reasonable O
mpg O
. O

However O
, O
they O
would O
never O
drive O
the O
car N
with O
me H
in O
it O
to O
prove O
their O
findings N
. O

I H
wonder O
if O
they O
were O
going O
down O
a O
hill N
! O

They O
told O
me H
to O
bring O
it O
back O
after O
5000 O
miles N
. O

I H
brought O
it O
back O
with O
9000 O
miles N
. O

They O
" O
finished O
" O
the O
work N
and O
told O
me H
the O
car N
was O
ready O
. O

I H
found O
out H
they O
did O
not O
even O
drive O
the O
car N
, O
stated O
they O
looked O
at O
it O
before O
. O

They O
still O
would O
not O
drive O
the O
car N
with O
me H
to O
show O
their O
mpg O
number N
. O

They O
also O
claimed O
not O
to O
see O
anything O
wrong O
with O
the O
blower N
fan N
( O
a O
seperate O
issue N
) O
, O
but O
when O
I H
drove O
the O
car N
home N
I H
had O
the O
same O
symptoms N
. O

I H
will O
never O
purchace O
another O
vehicle N

Great H
Job H

I H
want O
to O
say O
that O
Mike H
did O
a O
great O
job N
for O
our H
family H
in O
our H
time N
of O
need O
. O

Both O
my H
grandparents H
passed O
away O
4 O
months N
apart O
and O
Mike H
was O
very O
understanding N
. O

It O
was O
a O
very O
trying O
time N
for O
my H
family H
and O
myself H
yet O
Mike H
took O
the O
time N
to O
greet O
each O
and O
every O
one N
one N
of O
us H
. O

He O
is O
very O
professional O
in O
his O
position N
as O
a O
director H
and O
yet O
he O
still O
made O
time N
to O
be O
compassionate O
for O
what O
we H
were O
all O
going O
through O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
sure O
its O
it O
s H
not O
every O
day N
that O
a O
funeral N
director H
sees O
the O
same O
family H
in O
such O
a O
short O
time N
. O

My H
grandfather H
passed O
away O
silently O
in O
his O
sleep O
, O
and O
my H
grandmother H
passed O
away O
after O
a O
short O
struggle O
with O
cancer N
. O

Both O
my H
grandparents H
looked O
as O
natural O
as O
could O
be O
expected O
. O

Thank O
you H
Mike H
for O
all O
your H
help O
professionally O
and O
personally O

6:00 O
pm O
. O

There O
were O
3 O
names N
before O
us H
. O

The O
greeter H
said O
there O
was O
about O
15 O
minutes N
waiting O
. O

However O
, O
we H
waited O
and O
waited O
and O
in O
the O
mean O
time N
, O
saw O
4 O
groups N
of O
people N
simply O
just O
paraded O
in O
without O
signing O
there O
names N
. O

This O
sign N
in O
policy N
is O
posted O
by O
the O
restaurant N
“ O
no O
reservation N
, O
sign N
your H
name N
here O
” O
. O

I H
had O
to O
ask O
the O
greeter H
, O
he O
explained O
his O
reasons N
with O
broken O
English O
. O

I H
could O
not O
understand O
any O
his O
reasons N
. O

I H
could O
only O
take O
it O
as O
they O
would O
seat N
the O
people N
they O
know O
first O
. O

My H
conclusion N
is O
that O
you H
should O
only O
go O
there O
if O
you H
want O
to O
wait N
a O
least O
an O
hour N
and O
see O
all O
kinds N
other O
people N
being O
seated O
before O
you H
. O

Instructor H
never O
showed O
up O

January O
15th O
-- O
We H
were O
signed O
up O
for O
Saturday's O
Saturday O
's H
2 O
PM N
class N
" O
Beginning N
Yoga N
with O
Brittany H
. O
" O

We H
even O
arrived O
10 O
minutes N
early O
as O
the O
website N
suggests O
. O

The O
instructor H
did O
not O
show O
up O
! O

We H
waited O
until O
2:25 O
PM N
and O
then O
left O
. O

There O
were O
2 O
in O
our H
group N
, O
and O
a O
3rd O
person H
was O
also O
in O
the O
parking O
lot N
waiting O
for O
this O
class N
. O

Well O
, O
not O
much O
I H
can O
say O
except O
I'm O
I H
'm O
very O
disappointed O
with O
this O
experience N
. O

This O
was O
our H
first O
visit O
to O
your H
studio N
. O

In O
today's O
today N
's H
instant O
world N
, O
there's O
there O
's H
no O
reason N
for O
the O
instructor H
not O
to O
even O
have O
given O
us H
a O
phone N
call O
or O
e-mail N
if O
she O
was O
going O
to O
be O
late O
. O

As O
a O
yoga N
studio N
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
sure O
you're H
you H
're O
all O
aware O
that O
all O
actions N
generate O
karma N
… O

and O
sometimes O
karma N
can O
manifest O
itself O
on O
a O
bad O
review N
on O
Google O
. O

Finest O
?? O

Really O
?? O

I H
beg O
to O
differ O
. O

This O
place N
is O
marginal O
at O
best O
. O

Not O
very O
welcoming O
and O
focused O
mostly O
on O
keeping N
little O
kids H
entertained O
. O

I H
was O
not O
impressed O
, O
and O
quite O
frustrated O
at O
their O
lack N
of O
rating O
for O
their O
courses N
. O

I H
understand O
not O
wanting O
to O
put O
labels N
like O
5.10 O
on O
an O
indoor O
course N
, O
because O
yes O
, O
it O
is O
not O
the O
same O
, O
but O
some O
clear N
understanding N
of O
the O
difficulty N
of O
one N
course N
to O
another O
is O
nice O
when O
you H
are O
an O
intermediate O
climber H
looking O
to O
improve O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
waste O
my H
time N
on O
routes N
set O
for O
children H
, O
but O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
take O
on O
something O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
handle N
just O
to O
strain O
myself H
to O
exhaustion N
. O

Rate O
the O
routes N
, O
with O
understandable O
markings N
and O
a O
more O
detailed O
system N
than O
easy O
, O
moderate O
, O
and O
hard O
. O

Again O
, O
a O
great O
outing N
for O
the O
kids H
, O
a O
frustration N
for O
an O
out H
of O
town N
climber H
. O

Best O
DJ's H
In O
Town N
! O

Wow O
! O

These O
guys H
were O
the O
best O
. O

They O
were O
thorough O
, O
high O
class N
, O
and O
went O
above O
and O
beyond O
. O

We H
never O
had O
to O
worry O
about O
a O
thing N
, O
and O
they O
led O
the O
way N
the O
whole O
time N
. O

They O
asked O
us H
things N
that O
we H
would O
have O
never O
have O
thought O
of O
, O
and O
took O
extra O
time N
to O
meet O
with O
us H
when O
we H
needed O
it O
before O
the O
wedding N
. O

Having O
a O
team N
was O
the O
best O
because O
they O
kept O
the O
flow N
of O
the O
wedding N
going O
the O
whole O
time N
! O

They O
may O
look O
young O
but O
don't O
do O
n't O
let O
that O
fool H
you H
, O
as O
their O
knowledge N
of O
music N
far O
surpassed O
what O
we H
expected O
. O

I H
am O
a O
music N
junkie H
that O
grew O
up O
in O
the O
80's N
, O
and O
my H
dad H
worked O
for O
a O
record N
label N
in O
the O
1960's N
. O

So O
we H
didn't O
did O
n't O
expect O
them O
to O
even O
know O
some O
of O
the O
requests N
that O
we H
asked O
that O
night N
. O

They O
just O
really O
know O
their O
stuff N
! O

NEVER O
fear N
going O
to O
the O
dentist H
again O
! O

I'm O
I H
'm O
61 O
years N
old O
and O
have O
dental O
problems N
my H
entire O
life N
. O

By O
the O
age N
of O
24 O
I H
stopped O
going O
to O
the O
dentist H
. O

My H
fear N
and O
discomfort N
from O
dental O
work N
scared O
me H
! O

It O
took O
all O
the O
courage N
I H
could O
muster O
to O
make O
an O
appointment N
. O

At O
the O
front N
door N
of O
his O
office N
, O
I H
nearly O
turned O
around O
. O

I H
considered O
just O
leaving O
after O
going O
inside O
and O
nearly O
did O
. O

Doctor O
Gonzales O
and O
his O
entire O
staff N
are O
the O
most O
professional O
people N
I H
have O
ever O
dealt O
with O
. O

They O
made O
me H
feel O
confident O
in O
what O
they O
would O
do O
, O
and O
treated O
me H
like O
a O
member N
of O
their O
own O
family H
. O

I H
never O
felt N
pain N
or O
discomfort N
. O

The O
ability N
to O
smile O
and O
eat O
again O
can O
only O
be O
described O
as O
a O
whole O
new O
lease N
on O
life N
. O

Thank O
you H
Doctor H
Gonzales O
, O
Doctor H

HORRIBLE O
SERVICE N
AND O
FOOD N

not O
only O
is O
this O
place N
too O
expensive O
for O
what O
it O
is O
, O
its O
it O
s H
horrible O
! O

In O
the O
past N
, O
I H
got O
a O
steak N
and O
there O
was O
more O
fat O
and O
rough O
pieces N
than O
there O
was O
good O
steak N
( O
and O
this O
was O
the O
sirloin N
! O
) O
, O
the O
sides N
were O
drenched O
with O
butter N
and O
the O
salad N
was O
a O
little O
on O
the O
brown O
side N
. O

Today N
we H
went O
for O
a O
party N
( O
during O
lunch N
, O
so O
the O
place N
was O
empty O
) O
with O
about O
25 O
other O
people N
. O

It O
took O
over O
1.5 O
hours N
for O
our H
food N
to O
come O
out H
and O
by O
that O
time N
my H
8 O
month N
old O
had O
it O
! O

Does O
it O
seriously O
take O
that O
long O
for O
a O
soup N
and O
salad N
? O

I H
was O
a O
waitress H
for O
years N
and O
a O
key N
rule N
is O
to O
serve O
customers H
with O
small O
children H
before O
others O
, O
as O
I H
was O
the O
last O
to O
get O
my H
food N
. O

I H
would O
NOT O
recommend O
having O
a O
party N
here O
or O
even O
going O
here O
. O

Texas O
Roadhouse O
is O
WAY N
better O
!! O

Spay O
and O
neuter N
service N
. O

I H
have O
no O
doubt O
that O
the O
rescue N
is O
wonderful O
. O

But O
I H
had O
my H
cat A
spayed O
through O
their O
reduced O
/ O
free O
spay O
and O
neuter N
program N
and O
the O
vet H
they O
sent O
us H
to O
was O
first O
of O
all O
a O
hour N
and O
a O
half O
away O
, O
and O
4 O
days N
later O
we H
had O
to O
bring O
them O
to O
our H
normal O
vet H
because O
the O
vets H
at O
the O
place N
in O
wisconsin O
did O
a O
crappy O
job N
and O
they O
got O
infections N
. O

My H
vet H
even O
said O
it O
was O
not O
my H
fault N
it O
was O
the O
vet H
that O
did O
the O
surgery N
, O
So O
I H
would O
not O
recommend O
getting O
that O
program N
unless O
you H
have O
an O
extra O
hundred O
dollars N
or O
so O
for O
antibiotics N
and O
a O
vet H
visit O
. O

You'd O
You H
'd O
think O
they O
would O
do O
a O
good O
job N
but O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
care N
unless O
they O
are O
getting O
paid O
full O
price N
. O

Which O
is O
so O
dumb O
. O

Not O
to O
mention N
the O
fact N
that O
they O
gave O
us H
our H
cats A
back O
not O
even O
30 O
minutes N
after O
they O
were O
out H
from O
surgery N
. O

Billing N
Issues N
... O

I H
had O
a O
routine N
surgery N
for O
an O
ingrown O
toenail N
. O

My H
insurance N
company N
, O
Blue O
Cross O
/ O
Blue O
Shield O
paid O
the O
fees N
and O
everything O
was O
fine O
. O

Then O
I H
got O
a O
bill N
for O
$ O
483.00 O
. O

The O
doctor's O
doctor H
's H
office N
said O
that O
payments N
had O
been O
" O
reversed O
" O
. O

Blue O
cross O
has O
no O
record N
of O
aa O
reversal N
. O

The O
office N
refused O
my H
requests N
to O
see O
what O
they O
got O
from O
BC O
/ O
BS N
. O

They O
eventually O
turned O
it O
over O
to O
a O
collection N
agency N
and O
now O
will O
not O
even O
discuss O
the O
matter N
. O

I H
eventually O
decided O
to O
just O
pay O
the O
balance O
even O
though O
the O
doctor H
has O
already O
been O
paid O
, O
but O
now O
the O
collection N
agency N
is O
trying O
to O
say O
another O
reversal N
of O
$ O
160.00 O
has O
come O
through O
. O

It O
was O
an O
ingrown O
toenail N
. O

How O
much O
could O
it O
possibly O
cost O
? O

Not O
only O
am O
I H
being O
bilked O
for O
money N
I H
do O
not O
owe O
, O
the O
office N
staff N
is O
rude O
to O
boot O
. O

I H
think O
this O
office N
has O
some O
serious O
billing N
practice O
issues N
! O

We H
have O
been O
blessed O
to O
find O
Elite O
Flyers O
online O
and O
would O
not O
use H
anyone O
else O
to O
handle N
our H
postcards N
, O
posters N
, O
etc O
. O

We H
were O
looking O
for O
a O
company N
with O
decent O
rates N
as O
our H
company N
was O
just O
getting O
started O
. O

They O
have O
the O
best O
rates N
and O
GREAT O
customer H
service N
. O

On O
one N
order O
, O
we H
needed O
it O
rushed O
and O
shipped O
to O
a O
different O
state N
. O

They O
did O
that O
with O
no O
problem N
. O

I H
also O
appreciate O
their O
honesty N
. O

I H
sent O
a O
graphic N
that O
would O
have O
been O
distorted O
if O
printed O
as O
it O
was O
. O

They O
called O
and O
worked O
with O
me H
to O
fix O
it O
so O
that O
it O
would O
look O
perfect O
. O

They O
recently O
surprised O
me H
a O
larger O
order O
. O

I H
ordered O
1000 O
postcards N
, O
we H
normally O
order O
5000 O
or O
more O
. O

Because O
they O
had O
room N
to O
do O
5000 O
, O
they O
created O
the O
larger O
amount N
, O
and O
shipped O
them O
early O
. O

I H
recommend O
this O
company N
to O
ANYONE O
and O
everyone O
that O
needs N
great O
work N
done O
at O
a O
reasonable O
rate N
! O

They O
have O
a O
customer H
for O
life N
in O
us H
! O

sheisters H

i H
made O
the O
mistake N
of O
buying O
from O
these O
thieves H
. O

I H
paid O
2 O
k O
cash N
for O
a O
truck N
with O
a O
blown O
motor N
. O

Their O
so O
called O
mechanic H
said O
the O
engine N
was O
good O
and O
" O
There O
is O
nothing N
mechanicly O
wrong O
with O
this O
truck N
" O
. O

Well O
I H
think O
a O
blown O
engine N
falls O
under O
the O
catagory N
of O
mechanics N
right O
? O

Anyway O
they O
jimmy N
rigged O
it O
so O
i H
could O
drive O
it O
home N
. O

The O
next O
day N
i H
took O
it O
to O
2 O
auto N
shops N
and O
they O
both O
told O
me H
the O
same O
thing N
, O
engine N
is O
junk N
. O

I H
called O
and O
got O
the O
same O
runaround O
on O
hold O
and O
noone O
calls O
you H
back O
. O

From O
a O
moral O
standpoint N
, O
you H
guys H
are O
really O
gonna O
gon O
na O
take O
2,000 O
bucks N
from O
someone H
that O
needs N
that O
truck N
to O
work N
and O
support N
his O
family H
when O
you H
know O
its O
it O
s H
just O
a O
piece N
of O
scrap N
metal O
? O

If O
it O
lasted O
1 O
month N
i H
could O
suck O
it O
up O
but O
1 O
day N
? O

Grimy O
work N
you H
guys H
do O
. O

Buy O
your H

This O
company N
is O
overpriced O
for O
their O
services N
. O

They O
pride N
themselves O
on O
being O
an O
event N
and O
team N
building N
company N
for O
corporate O
clients H
but O
you H
better O
believe O
they O
are O
going O
to O
mark N
you H
up O
on O
that O
feel O
good O
premise N

On O
a O
recent O
event N

that O
I H
had O
done O
, O
they O
came O
in O
thousands N
of O
dollars N
over O
their O
local O
competition N

The O
craziest O
part N
is O
that O
they O
aren't O
are O
n't O
even O
based O
locally O
at O
the O
city N
I'm O
I H
'm O
in O

they O
just O

I've O
I H

spoken O

are O

them O
who O
had O
nothing N

to O
say O
about O
the O
company N

in O
fact N
were O
afraid O
to O
quote N

Orr's O
Orr O
's H
a O
nightmare N
! O

DON'T O
DO O
N'T O
GO O
! O

My H
boyfriend H
and O
I H
were O
woken O
up O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night N
at O
our H
campsite N
by O
drunken O
kids H
who'd O
who O
'd O
arrived O
around O
1:00 O
am O
and O
were O
drinking O
at O
the O
springs N
. O

When O
we H
complained O
to O
the O
management N
( O
as O
we H
were O
instructed O
to O
do O
if O
there O
were O
any O
problems N
) O
, O
nothing N
happened O
! O

Then O
, O
the O
next O
morning N
, O
when O
we H
, O
among O
many O
other O
irate O
guests H
, O
asked O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
owner H
, O
he O
refused O
to O
do O
so O
. O

Not O
only O
that O
, O
but O
he O
told O
us H
, O
via O
his O
manager H
, O
that O
it O
was O
our H
responsibility N
to O
get O
up O
a O
second N
time N
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night N
and O
call O
the O
night N
staff N
if O
the O
problem N
continued O
, O
even O
though O
his O
manager H
did O
nothing N
the O
first O
time N
to O
stop N
the O
kids H
. O

Orr O
is O
not O
relaxing O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
a O
safe O
space N
, O
and O
the O
owner H
is O
awful O
. O

To O
add O
insult N
to O
injury N
, O
he O
refused O
to O
refund N
our H
money N
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
go O

FHS O
is O
a O
good O
high O
school N
-- O
c O
/ O
o N
1998 O

I H
enjoyed O
my H
time N
at O
Franklin H
High N
School N
. O

We H
had O
relatively O
good O
facilities N
at O
the O
time N
-- O
decent O
science N
labs N
, O
with O
multiple O
hoods N
and O
access O
to O
good O
equipment N
; O
nice O
gymnasiums N
, O
and O
a O
well O
- O
funded O
music N
department N
( O
I H
was O
in O
the O
guitar N
ensemble N
) O
. O

Now O
, O
of O
course N
, O
there's O
there O
's H
a O
new O
building N
, O
with O
presumably O
better O
facilities N
. O

All O
to O
the O
good O
. O

For O
those O
who O
care N
, O
a O
good O
proportion N
of O
the O
my H
class N
went O
on O
to O
4 O
- O
year N
colleges N
, O
many O
of O
them O
ranked O
in O
the O
top N
50 O
of O
US O
News O
. O

If O
I H
remember O
, O
students H
went O
to O
Dartmouth O
, O
U. O
Penn O
, O
Duke O
, O
BU O
, O
William H
and O
Mary H
, O
Vassar O
, O
Howard O
, O
and O
Carnegie H
Mellon O
, O
among O
others O
. O

Many O
students H
went O
to O
Rutgers O
, O
including O
their O
top N
- O
ranked O
pharmacy N
program N
. O

The O
point N
is O
-- O
FHS O
gives O
you H
the O
opportunity N
to O
make O
it O
to O
a O
good O
college N
, O
but O
you H
need O
to O
work N
hard O

Absolutely O
the O
best O
little O
motel N
on O
the O
coast N
! O

I've O
I H
've O
stayed O
at O
this O
fabulous O
little O
motel N
two O
years N
running O
, O
and O
I H
have O
to O
say O
it's O
it O
's H
one N
of O
the O
best O
lodging N
experiences N
I've O
I H
've O
ever O
had O
on O
the O
coast N
... O
and O
I'm O
I H
'm O
even O
comparing O
it O
to O
the O
big O
resorts N
I've O
I H
've O
stayed O
at O
! O

A H
large O
group N
of O
my H
friends H
and O
I H
rent O
almost O
the O
whole O
motel N
every O
year N
for O
a O
weekend N
, O
and O
the O
experience N
and O
stay O
have O
always O
been O
five O
- O
star N
. O

The O
rooms N
are O
SO O
clean O
, O
the O
managers H
/ O
owners H
are O
the O
nicest O
people N
, O
the O
place N
feels O
so O
homey O
, O
and O
the O
location N
and O
grounds N
are O
beautiful O
. O

There's O
There O
's H
a O
restaurant N
nearby O
( O
walking O
distance N
) O
with O
a O
great O
breakfast N
, O
and O
's H
a O
market N
across O
the O
street N
. O

The O
motel N
is O
very O
well O
maintained O
, O
and O
the O
managers H
are O
so O
accomodating O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
kind N
of O
like O
visiting O
family H
each O
year N
! O
;-) O

I H
honestly O
can't O
ca O
n't O
rave N
enough O
about O
this O
place N
... O
it's O
it O
's H
really O
a O
hidden O
gem N
worth N
checking O
out H
! O

My H
favorite O
cuban O
cafe N
in O
Orlando O

I H
have O
been O
eating O
Cuban O
for O
a O
long O
time N
, O
sandwiches N
mainly O
along O
with O
other O
dishes N
.. O

I H
love O
Cuban O
coffee N
, O
colada O
... O
mmmm O
anyways O
I H
found O
this O
place N
and O
can't O
ca O
n't O
stop N
going O
there O
, O
I H
stop N
in O
at O
least O
once O
a O
week N
and O
anytime O
I'm O
I H
'm O
in O
the O
area N
for O
a O
Cuban O
coffee N
or O
snack N
. O

The O
place N
is O
chill O
and O
comfortable O
. O

They O
don't O
do O
n't O
speak O
the O
best O
English O
but O
enough O
to O
get O
by O
. O

They O
bake O
bread N
fresh O
daily O
, O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
press N
their O
sandwiches N
which O
is O
the O
way N
I H
like O
it O
, O
and O
the O
meat N
is O
always O
fresh O
. O

They O
have O
a O
great O
lunch N
special O
with O
your H
choice N
of O
meat N
, O
chicken N
, O
steak N
, O
or O
pork N
and O
rice N
and O
black O
beans N
and O
fried O
plantains A
. O

And O
their O
breakfast N
is O
awesome O
!! O

I H
cannot O
can O
not O
describe O
how O
delicious O
the O
mango A
and O
cheese N
pastries N
and O
the O
omelets N
are O
to O
die O
for O
. O

Stop O
in O
and O
have O
a O
bite N
you H
won't O
wo O
n't O
regret O
it O
. O

A H
slice N
of O

in O

off O

highly O
recommended O
. O

I H
have O
been O
going O
to O
Warner O
Family O
for O
a O
number N
of O
years N
and O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
. O

I've O
I H
've O
read O
some O
of O
the O
reviews N
below O
and O
would O
like O
to O
state N
that O
yes O
, O
like O
any O
other O
doctors H
doctor H
s H
office N
there O
is O
sometimes O
a O
wait N
( O
depending O
on O
what O
other O
patients H
are O
being O
seen O
for O
) O
and O
some O
of O
the O
tests N
and O
procedures N
that O
are O
ran O
can O
be O
costly O
( O
just O
like O
they O
would O
be O
for O
any O
other O
medical O
tests N
elsewhere O
if O
you H
do O
not O
have O
insurance N
) O
... O

I H
have O
seen O
several O
of O
the O
providers H
from O
the O
office N
and O
have O
not O
once O
been O
shown O
anything O
but O
care N
and O
consideration N
. O

I H
cant O
ca O
nt O
speak O
for O
them O
but O
any O
tests N
or O
appointments N
they O
recommend O
are O
probably O
in O
the O
best O
interests N
of O
us H
( O
the O
patient H
) O
and O
you H
have O
the O
ability N
to O
decline N
anything O
that O
they O
suggest O
to O
you H
. O

I H
personally O
have O
had O
wonderful O
service N
and O
if O
youre H
you H
re O
truely O
looking O
for O
a O
FAMILY N
practice O
... O
Warner O
Family O
is O
the O
place N
for O
you H
. O

Not O
what O
i H
expected O
! O

We H
read O
the O
good O
reviews N
before O
going O
and O
had O
high O
hopes N
.. O
but O
to O
our H
dismay N
it O
didnt O
did O
nt O
turn O
out H
that O
way N
! O

~ O
It O
took O
over O
40 O
mins N
to O
be O
taken O
to O
our H
table N
, O
once O
there O
it O
took O
another O
20 O
mins N
to O
get O
our H
orders N
and O
took O
a O
further O
45 O
mins N
till O
our H
starters H
landed O
on O
our H
table N
. O

Very O
frustrating O
for O
a O
restaurant N
that O
has O
1 O
rosette N
and O
is O
supposedly O
renowned O
for O
the O
service N
... O
hmm O
There O
was O
no O
canape's O
or O
amuse O
to O
keep O
us H
occupied O
, O
once O
we H
complained O
about O
the O
wait N
they O
took O
us H
something O
to O
nibble O
on O
but O
that O
took O
us H
getting O
out H
our H
chairs N
and O
wondering O
round O
to O
do O
that O
and O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
get O
anyones O
anyone O
s H
attention N
. O

Scallops N
were O
overcooked O
and O
the O
foie O
gras O
was O
cold O
but O
the O
rest N
of O
the O
food N
was O
lovely O
. O

On O
top N
of O
that O
though O
they O
tried O
to O
charge O
us H
service N
charge O
just O
to O
rub O
it O
it O
.... O

Wouldn't O
Would O
n't O
go O
back O
as O
there O
are O
a O
lot N
of O
places N
A H
LOT N
better O
and O
cheaper O
. O

Nice O
selection N
, O
very O
clean O
, O
friendly O
staff N
! O

Hot O
Iron O
has O
become O
a O
favorite O
of O
our H
family H
. O

Everyone O
can O
get O
the O
signature N
dish N
with O
ingredients N
and O
spices N
that O
they O
want O
and O
have O
the O
fun O
of O
watching O
it O
cook O
. O

The O
staff N
are O
very O
friendly O
and O
conscientious O
. O

They O
always O
ask O
if O
you H
have O
meat N
in O
your H
dish N
, O
( O
for O
vegetarians H
like O
me H
) O
, O
they O
scrub O
an O
area N
of O
the O
grill N
and O
use H
separate O
utensils N
to O
cook O
. O

They O
don't O
do O
n't O
just O
dump O
your H
ingredients N
on O
and O
cook O
either O
, O
but O
carefully O
separate O
meat N
to O
the O
hotter O
parts N
of O
the O
grill N
and O
still O
manage O
to O
keep O
the O
veggies O
from O
turning O
to O
mush N
. O

The O
selection N
of O
meats N
, O
veggies O
and O
sauces N
is O
awesome O
too O
! O

Every O
time N
we H
go O
they O
seem O
to O
have O
a O
different O
ingredient N
or O
two O
which O
keeps O
things N
interesting O
. O

Meats N
are O
kept O
VERY O
cold O
, O
seafood N
smells O
fresh O
and O
the O
serving O
bar N
is O
VERY O
clean O
. O

Prices N
are O
reasonable O
, O
( O
Kids O
Kid O
s H
meals N
are O
around O
4.99 O
) O
and O
Wednesday's O
they O
have O
discount N
dinner N
prices N
, O
I H
believe O
. O

Great H
Cookies N
, O
Cakes N
, O
and O
Customer H
Service O

It O
was O
my H
birthday N
and O
I H
had O
a O
last O
minute O
idea N
to O
have O
a O
bakery N
cake N
instead O
of O
one N
pre-made O
in O
a O
convenience N
store N
, O
but O
the O
problem N
was O
it O
was O
the O
day N
before O
Valentines O
Valentine O
s H
and O
when O
many O
bakeries N
turned O
me H
down O
for O
a O
plain O
vanilla N
rectangle N
cake N
, O
Fiona H
stepped O
up O
to O
the O
plate N
and O
was O
able O
to O
make O
a O
fantastic O
beautiful O
cake N
. O

Not O
only O
did O
it O
taste N
wonderful O
, O
but O
the O
texture N
was O
unbelievable O
, O
the O
frosting N
wasn't O
was O
n't O
overly O
sweet O
to O
over O
power N
the O
cake N
, O
and O
the O
cake N
itself O
was O
just O
amazingly O
soft O
, O
and O
fluffy O
, O
and O
just O
perfect O
overall O
. O

Although O
I'll O
I H
'll O
have O
to O
drive O
a O
little O
out H
of O
my H
way N
to O
go O
there O
, O
I'll O
I H
'll O
gladly O
do O
it O
knowing O
that O
since O
she's O
she O
's H
been O
astounding O
to O
me H
once O
before O
that O
she'll O
she O
'll O
always O
be O
that O
way N
! O

( O
Also O
she O
has O
a O
really O
great O
website N
! O

And O
we H
bought O
a O
few O
cookies N
there O
too O
, O
they O
were O
fantastic O
as O
well O
! O

She O
deserves O
many O

What O
I H

that O

I H
can O

An O
Asset N

Richmond O

For O
a O
long O
time N
, O
one N
big O
source N
of O
entertainment N
missing O
from O
the O
Richmond O
City N
Limits N
was O
a O
first O
- O
run O
multiplex N
. O

Bowtie O
has O
filled O
that O
role N
nicely O
. O

The O
theatre N
is O
in O
an O
old O
brick N
warehouse N
, O
which O
is O
a O
block O
away O
from O
the O
Flying O

The O
owners H
of O
Bowtie O
manged O
to O
add O
something O
new O
while O
preserving O
what O
was O
already O
there O
. O

The O

greatly O
improved O
the O

I H
am O
a O
proud O
owner H
of O
a O
brand N
new O
2010 O
Hyundai O
Genesis O
. O

I H
have O
never O
seen O
this O
car N
before O
until O
this O
lady H
at O
wal O
mart O
had O
it O
and O
she O
told O
me H
she O
got O
it O
here O
and O
that O
everyone O
was O
so O
nice O
to O
her O
. O

I H
asked O
her O
who O
she O
worked O
with O
and O
she O
just O
told O
me H
ti O
was O
the O
sales N
manager H
. O

I H
took O
the O
weekend N
off O
and O
came O
in O
and O
asked O
for O
the O
manager H
who O
is O
Jeff H
and O
he O
remembered O
her O
right O
away O
even O
remembered O
her O
dog A
, O
I H
was O
a O
bit N
shocked O
that O
someone H
would O
pay O
that O
close O
attention N
. O

We H
got O
to O
talking O
and O
he O
got O
me H
set O
up O
and O
I H
test N
drove O
with O
Craig H
and O
I H
fell O
head N
over O
heels N
for O
this O
car N
all O
I H
kept O
saying O
, O
" O
was O
I H
gotta O
got O
ta O
have O
it O
! O
" O

I H
thouhgt O
it O
would O
be O
out H
of O
my H
price N
range N
but O
they O
really O
worked O
with O
me H
and O
now O
I H
couldnt O
could O
nt O
be O
happier O
. O

Jeff H
and O
Craig H
are O
really O
good O
at O
what O
they O
do O
and O
know O
exactly O
how O
to O
treat O
a O
customer H

Definitely O
go O

the O
Bonanza O
store N
2 O
weeks N
ago O
, O
before O
I H
ripped O
out H
350 O
sq O
ft N
of O
ceramic O
tile N
... O
was O
told O
I H
would O
need O
a O
" O
dual O
head N
concrete O
grinder N
" O
to O
remove O
thinset O
and O
make O
a O
nice O
" O
finished O
" O
look O
( O
ready O
for O
concrete O
stain N
) O
. O

Was O
quoted O
$ O
55 O
all O
inclusive O
of O
grinder N
inserts N
, O
etc O
. O

No O
problem N
, O
sounded O
like O
it's O
it O
's H
done O
every O
day N
. O

Will O
look O
beautiful O
. O

Got O
the O
tile N
ripped O
out H
, O
call O
today N
, O
now O
all O
the O
sudden O
this O
grinder N
won't O
wo O
n't O
leave O
a O
finished O
look O
AND O
it's O
it O
's H
$ O
125 O
PLUS O
around O
$ O
75 O
for O
the O
inserts N
. O

I H
can O
rent O
another O
machine N
for O
like O
$ O
60 O
that O
will O
give O
it O
a O
finished O
look O
. O

So O
from O
$ O
55 O
to O
$ O
260 O
? O

Are O
they O
serious O
? O

I H
feel O
like O
they O
didn't O
did O
n't O
tell O
me H
the O
pitfalls N
before O
I H
pulled O
out H
this O
tile N
and O
now O
that O
I H
have O
no O
other O
options N
they O
want O
5 O
TIMES N
the O
price N
? O

Either O
these O
people N
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
anything O
about O
what O
they O
are O
renting O
, O
or O
worse O
- O
they O
are O
bait N
and O
switching O
. O

One O
suspects O
that O
earlier O
reviewer H
works O
for O
another O
laundry N
. O

Outside O
of O
parking O
being O
at O
a O
premium N
, O
especially O
on O
discount N
days N
, O
The O
Laundry O
Tub O
is O
not O
filthy O
and O
it's O
it O
's H
no O
smaller O
than O
any O
of O
a O
dozen N
laundromats N
I've O
I H
've O
been O
in O
. O

Yes O
, O
there O
are O
bigger O
, O
but O
bigger O
isn't O
is O
n't O
necessarily O
better O
. O

I H
availed O
myself H
of O
the O
wash O
'n O
fold N
service N
, O
taking O
just O
about O
a O
year's O
year N
's H
worth N
of O
dirty O
clothes N
in O
and O
getting O
back O
neatly O
folded O
, O
clean O
clothes N
in O
clear N
plastic N
bags N
( O
I'd O
I H
'd O
originally O
brought O
them O
in O
, O
in O
six O
large O
yellow O
garbage N
bags N
) O
. O

The O
cost O
was O
certainly O
reasonable O
and O
I H
will O
continue O
my H
patronage N
of O
The O
Laundry O
Tub O
in O
the O
future N
. O

Didn't O
Did O
n't O
hurt O
any O
that O
they O
knew O
my H
name N
by O
my H
second N
visit O
and O
greeted O
me H
warmly O
then O
and O
on O
my H
third O
visit O
. O

Whereas O
my H
answer N
to O
the O
question N
" O
Where O
do O
you H
get O
your H
laundry N
done O
? O
" O
used O
to O
be O
, O
" O
At O
the O
checkout N
line N
at O
WalMart O
, O
" O
I H
can O
honestly O
say O
the O
answer N
now O
is O
, O
" O
At O
The O
Laundry O
Tub O
. O
" O

Thank O
you H
! O

I H
recently O
took O
a O
rescue N
puppy A
to O
this O
Clinic N
and O
I H
was O
SHOCKED O
at O
how O
well O
Romeo H
and O
My H
family H
was O
treated O
. O

They O
worked O
around O
the O
clock N
to O
ensure O
that O
my H
puppy A
life N
was O
saved O
. O

We H
have O
to O
leave O
him O
at O
the O
vet H
for O
3 O
days N
and O
I H
was O
told O
to O
call O
for O
check O
ups O
as O
often O
as O
I H
wished O
that O
no O
matter N
how O
many O
times N
I H
called O
I H
would O
not O
annoy O
them O
. O

lol O
They O
where O
super O
friendly O
towards O
us H
and O
treated O
us H
like O
people N
not O
walking O
bags N
of O
cash N
. O

In O
this O
day N
its O
it O
s H
rare O
to O
find O
such O
wonderful O
people N
who O
CARE O
, O
Not O
the O
kind N
of O
want O
to O
make O
cash N
. O

I H
would O
strongly O
suggest O
you H
give O
them O
the O
chance N
to O
prove O
to O
you H
that O
not O
all O
people N
in O
this O
world N
are O
evil O
! O

I H
will O
never O
go O
to O
another O
vet H
as O
long O
as O
I H
have O
animals A
. O

I H
live O
nearly O
two O
hours N
away O
and O
yet O
I H
will O
still O
make O
the O
drive O
to O
see O
them O
! O

In O
fact N
I H
look O
forward O
to O
taking O
my H
animals A
to O
the O
vet H
simply O
because O
of O
how O
my H
animals A
and O
I H
are O
treated O
. O

Okay O
, O
here's O
here O
's H
the O
scoop O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
a O
regular O
at O
the O
HH O
. O

The O
food N
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
serivce N
is O
horrible O
. O

I H
think O
they're O
they O
're O
still O
in O
the O
mindset N
from O
when O
it O
was O
only O
smokers H
sitting O
around O
and O
drinking O
... O
not O
in O
any O
hurry N
. O

In O
my H
experience N
the O
food N
has O
been O
excellent O
( O
for O
the O
most O
part N
) O
. O

However O
, O
the O
bartenders H
/ O
waitresses H
definately O
need O
to O
be O
re-trained O
( O
if O
they O
ever O
had O
any O
to O
begin O
with O
) O
and O
learn O
two O
things N
: O
only O
chat N
with O
customers H
when O
other O
customers H
are O
not O
impatiently O
waiting O
and O
to O
look O
around O
more O
often O
to O
see O
if O
people N
are O
waiting O
. O

In O
some O
cases N
the O
result N
is O
because O
of O
understaffing O
, O
in O
some O
cases N
the O
staff N
just O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
care N
/ O
know O
better O
. O

They O
must O
also O
get O
something O
to O
keep O
take O
- O
out H
warm O
, O
so O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
room N
temperature N
at O
best O
when O
you H
get O
it O
home N
. O

You H
just O
have O
to O
know O
what O
you're H
you H
're O
getting O
into O
when O
you H
go O
. O

Nice O
local O
pub N
, O
excellent O
food N
( O
especially O
wings N
) O
, O
and O
don't O
do O
n't O
go O
if O
you H
have O
a O
limited O
amount N
of O
time N
. O

Trust O
The O
Midas O
Touch N

I H
personally O
trust N
this O
Midas O
store N
with O
all O
my H
vehicles N
, O
I H
have O
been O
going O
there O
for O
years N
& O
would O
never O
go O
anywhere O
else O
! O

the O
staff N
is O
very O
personable O
& O
actually O
care N
about O
the O
customers H
safety N
rather O
than O
taking O
there O
money N
. O

This O
is O
however O
a O
very O
busy O
shop N
but O
there O
are O
appointments N
available O
& O
the O
staff N
up O
front N
will O
surely O
make O
sure O
you H
get O
back O
in O
a O
timely O
manner N
. O

I H
look O
at O
some O
of O
these O
other O
comments N
& O
laugh O
because O
people N
think O
that O
the O
world N
revolves O
around O
them O
! O

Like O
the O
girl H
with O
the O
fuse N
problem N
... O

Midas O
has O
the O
most O
high O
tech N
equipment N
in O
town N
& O
I H
guarantee N
you H
if O
they O
told O
you H
it O
was O
electrical O
then O
in O
deed O
its O
it O
s H
electrical O
! O

maybe O
you H
should O
understand O
how O
the O
world N
works O
& O
realize O
you H
are O
just O
like O
any O
other O
person H
& O
not O
put O
yourself H
on O
a O
pedestal N
. O

I H
will O
continue O
going O
to O
Dave H
at O
Midas O
because O
he O
is O
one N
of O
the O
most O
honest O
business N
owners H
in O
this O
town N
! O

When O
having O
your H
car N
worked O
on O
you H
have O
to O
trust N
the O
mechanic H
& O
this O
Midas O
is O
truly O
someone H
you H
can O
trust N
! O

We H
decided O
to O
try O
this O
place N
last O
night N
because O
we H
noticed O
that O
it O
had O
some O
interesting O
things N
on O
the O
menu N
aside O
from O
the O
usual O
rolls N
-- O
live O
scallop N
sashimi N
, O
duck A
breast N
nigiri O
with O
foie O
gras O
, O
panko O
mussels N
-- O
but O
none N
of O
these O
were O
particularly O
great O
or O
worth N
the O
sticker N
price N
. O

Additionally O
we H
tried O
the O
Logan O
Circle O
roll O
, O
spicy O
crab A
and O
tuna A
roll O
, O
and O
sweet O
potato N
tempura N
roll O
( O
$ O
15 O
, O
$ O
10 O
, O
and O
$ O
3.75 O
respectively O
) O
. O

The O
sweet O
potato N
tempura N
roll O
was O
actually O
a O
great O
surprise O
: O
cheap O
and O
delicious O
, O
the O
only O
thing N
we H
tried O
that O
I H
would O
say O
was O
well O
worth N
it O
and O
a O
great O
value N
( O
and O
I H
never O
get O
vegetarian O
rolls N
) O
. O

The O
other O
rolls N
weren't O
were O
n't O
at O
all O
special O
, O
especially O
given O
their O
pricing N
. O

The O
bottom N
line N
is O
that O
the O
food N
isn't O
is O
n't O
great O
and O
is O
relatively O
high O
- O
priced O
. O

The O
service N
is O
solicitous O
, O
the O
atmosphere N
is O
nice O
and O
mod O
except O
the O
out H
- O
of O
- O
place N
flat O
- O
screen N
TV N
playing O
football N
. O

But O
I'd O
I H
'd O
go O
elsewhere O
unless O
the O
prices N
are O
cut O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
just O
not O
worth N
it O
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
Expect O
Sleep N
or O
Courtesy N

I H
was O
booked O
for O
2 O
nights N
at O
this O
hotel N
in O
Oct O
2007 O
. O

At O
3:15 O
am O
on O
night N
# O
2 O
, O
the O
fire N
alarm N
and O
strobe N
light N
activated O
in O
my H
room N
. O

These O
are O
not O
household N
type N
alarms N
. O

When O
they O
sound N
off O
, O
it O
is O
a O
true O
audio N
/ O
visual O
experience N
. O

I H
called O
the O
front N
desk N
and O
got O
no O
answer N
. O

After O
checking O
for O
signs N
of O
fire N
or O
smoke O
and O
seeing O
none N
, O
I H
decided O
to O
just O
pack O
up O
and O
leave O
. O

The O
desk N
agent H
actually O
argued O
with O
me H
, O
claiming O
that O
no O
such O
alarm N
had O
gone O
off O
( O
as O
if O
I H
would O
make O
that O
up O
? O
) O
. O

He O
finally O
admitted O
that O
only O
the O
4 O
ADA N
room N
alarms N
had O
sounded O
, O
so O
only O
4 O
guests H
were O
effected O
( O
no O
big O
deal O
to O
him O
) O
. O

This O
little O
drip N
offered O
no O
apologies N
whatsoever O
, O
and O
even O
refused O
to O
give O
me H
the O
name N
of O
the O
manager H
until O
I H
pressed O
him O
for O
it O
3 O
times N
. O

This O
hotel N
is O
adequate O
enough O
, O
but O
there O
is O
an O
obvious O
problem N
with O
the O
staff N
and O
management N
. O

Do O
not O
go O
there O
if O
you H
expect O
to O
sleep O
through O
the O
night N
. O

Poor O
Service O
, O
Lack N
of O
Passion O
: O
Do O
NOT O
go O

I H
began O
seeing O
Dr. O
Romanick O
back O
in O
2000 O
and O
have O
seen O
a O
significant O
decline N
in O
the O
quality N
of O
care N
, O
patient H
- O
doctor H
communication N
, O
and O
just O
the O
overall O
level N
of O
services N
. O

The O
poor O
quality N
starts O
at O
the O
receptionist H
desk N
, O
where O
the O
staff N
is O
very O
impatient O
and O
lack N
the O
efficiency N
I H
once O
loved O
about O
the O
office N
. O

It O
took O
them O
nearly O
two O
months N
to O
complete O
a O
simple O
task N
, O
and O
countless O
calls O
from O
my H
part N
due O
to O
their O
lack N
of O
response N
and O
passion N
( O
not O
that O
it's O
it O
's H
a O
requirement N
for O
the O
job N
, O
but O
it O
helps O
to O
at O
least O
pretend O
to O
be O
helpful O
) O
. O

Also O
, O
I H
was O
promised O
to O
have O
my H
test N
results N
emailed O
to O
me H
, O
but O
it O
never O
happened O
, O
and O
after O
a O
few O
attempts N
to O
get O
Dr. O
Romanick O
on O
the O
phone N
to O
brief N
me H
on O
my H
condition N
, O
I H
finally O
gave O
up O
and O
went O
to O
a O
different O
doctor H
. O

Please O
do O
not O
go O
there O
if O
it's O
it O
's H
professional O
, O
friendly O
, O
diligent O
medical O
services N
you're H
you H
're O
looking O
for O
. O

Save O
yourself H
the O
trouble N
, O
money N
and O
time N
and O
visit O
a O
more O
caring O
facility N
/ O
doctor H
. O

The O
moving O
company N
is O
actualy O
based O
in O
Brooklyn O
, O
but O
advertised O
all O
over O
NY O
/ O
NJ O
, O
including O
Fort O
Lee H
. O

When O
the O
guys H
arrived O
( O
2 O
hours N
later O
than O
agreed O
) O
they O
told O
that O
you H
have O
to O
pay O
all O
the O
tolls N
they O
payed O
coming O
from O
Brooklyn O
and O
extra O
$ O
100 O
for O
them O
to O
drive O
back O
from O
your H
destination N
. O

That O
was O
not O
in O
agreement N
eather O
, O
but O
they O
realy O
demand N
it O
. O

And O
another O
$ O
100 O
for O
wrapping N
the O
furniture N
. O

So O
totalling O
$ O
212 O
just O
for O
start O
before O
any O
work N
started O
. O

Guess O
what O
, O
was O
not O
in O
the O
initial O
agreement N
as O
well O
. O

I H
was O
moving O
out H
from O
2 O
bdr O
apartment N
and O
it O
took O
for O
3 O
strong O
guys H
6 O
hours N
to O
load N
a O
track N
( O
from O
2 O
pm O
- O
8 O
pm O
) O
. O

The O
only O
reason N
I'm O
I H
'm O
giving O
3 O
stars N
instead O
of O
1 O
or O
2 O
, O
I H
should O
admit O
, O
nothing N
was O
broken O
. O

So O
I H
still O
can O
recomend O
them O
but O
prepare O
pay O
twice O
as O
much O
as O
they O
tell O
you H
initially O
. O

One O
more O
thing N
, O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
take O
any O
credit N
cards N
or O
checks N
. O

You H
have O
to O
pay O
CASH N
ONLY O
before O
they O
start O
unloading O
track N
on O
your H
destination N
. O

Worst O
Apartments N
EVER O

We H
lived O
here O
for O
2 O
years N
, O
the O
first O
year N
or O
so O
was O
okay O
. O

Then O
, O
the O
more O
power N
they O
gave O
to O
Linda H
, O
the O
worse O
the O
place N
got O
. O

We H
were O
always O
having O
our H
water N
shut O
off O
, O
there O
were O
always O
people N
having O
parties N
at O
the O
pool N
, O
even O
after O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
closed O
. O

The O
pool N
was O
supposed O
to O
close O
at O
10 O
and O
they O
would O
have O
people N
down O
there O
until O
11:45 O
yelling N
, O
playing O
music N
and O
do O
who O
- O
knows O
- O
what O
in O
the O
dark O
corners N
of O
the O
pool N
. O

Then O
, O
when O
we H
moved O
out H
, O
we H
cleaned O
the O
apartment N
top N
to O
bottom N
, O
they O
came O
back O
and O
tried O
to O
charge O
us H
for O
two O
cleaning N
fees N
( O
and O
we H
never O
got O
our H
deposit O
back O
) O
and O
past N
utilities N
( O
that O
were O
already O
paid O
, O
we H
have O
check O
numbers N
and O
records N
of O
this O
) O
. O

Linda H
is O
the O
rudest O
person H
you H
will O
ever O
talk O
to O
and O
she O
sticks N
up O
for O
all O
of O
the O
trashy O
, O
rude O
people N
that O
live O
there O
, O
not O
the O
nice O
ones N
that O
actually O
give O
a O
crap N
about O
respecting O
others O
. O

Do O
not O
live O
here O
, O
you H
will O
regret O
it O

The O
Worst O
Experience O
Ever O
!!! O

I H
have O
worked O
with O
Ted H
Jurek O
at O
Decor O
and O
You H
, O
and O
it O
started O
out H
as O
a O
decent O
experience N
. O

He O
was O
referred O
to O
me H
by O
a O
friend H
, O
who O
didn't O
did O
n't O
have O
the O
best O
experience N
with O
Ted H
, O
but O
said O
that O
Ted H
was O
able O
to O
make O
up O
for O
his O
lack N
of O
preparedness N
at O
the O
end N
. O

I H
figure O
I H
would O
give O
this O
company N
a O
chance N
. O

However O
, O
after O
giving O
a O
required O
$ O
500.00 O
( O
NON O
REFUNDABLE O
) O
deposit O
before O
seeing O
any O
plans N
or O
ideas N
, O
I H
was O
sorry O
I H
did O
. O

We H
met O
a O
couple N
of O
weeks N
later O
, O
Ted H
was O
late O
. O

He O
brought O
fabric N
books N
, O
and O
pictures N
of O
furniture N
only O
, O
which O
all O
came O
way N
over O
budget N
. O

By O
the O
time N
we H
got O
to O
the O
budget N
i H
told O
him O
I H
could O
work N
with O
, O
there O
was O
basically O
no O
design N
. O

Just O
curtains N
and O
a O
couple N
of O
accessories N
. O

WHAT O
IS O
THAT O
????? O

This O
company N
is O
way N
too O
expensive O
with O
nothing N
to O
show O
for O
it O
. O

Please O
everyone O
.... O
take O
heed N
and O
don't O
do O
n't O
get O
caught O
up O
in O
the O
hype N
about O
DECOR O
and O
YOU H
working O
with O
every O
budget N
... O

This O
is O
just O
a O
way N
for O
them O
to O
squirm O
their O
way N
into O
your H
precious O
pocket N

Horrible O
. O

Horrible O
. O

When O
we H
walked O
in O
, O
the O
person H
behind O
desk N
said O
: O
" O
oh O
well O
, O
you H
must O
wait N
, O
I H
am O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
something O
. O
" O

After O
a O
good O
few O
minutes N
, O
he O
asked O
: O
" O
what O
do O
you H
want O
? O
" O

Somewhere O
in O
between O
his O
rudeness N
he O
asked O
if O
we H
smoked O
. O

I H
asked O
if O
this O
hotel N
had O
smoking O
rooms N
. O

He O
immediately O
said O
" O
no O
, O
there O
is O
a O
$ O
50 O
deposit O
now O
! O
" O

Sure O
enough O
he O
charged O
it O
to O
the O
credit N
card N
. O

When O
I H
inquired O
he O
rudely O
replied O
" O
in O
the O
morning N
when O
things N
are O
checked O
out H
you'll O
you H
'll O
get O
it O
back O
. O
" O

I H
called O
customer H
service N
about O
it O
because O
the O
website N
specifically O
states N
that O
there O
are O
no O
other O
charges N
at O
the O
check O
- O
in O
. O

I H
also O
mentioned O
to O
the O
reception N
person H
. O

He O
responded O
" O
we H
have O
problem N
with O
' O
people N
' O
" O
. O

Imagine O
a O
hotel N
having O
problems N
with O
people N
. O

I H
finally O
alerted O
him O
to O
his O
rudeness N
. O

He O
said O
he's O
he O
's H
had O
a O
long O
and O
bad O
day N
. O

We H
had O
no O
choice N
but O
to O
stay O
but O
will O
take O
this O
as O
far O
as O
we H
can O
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
stay O
there O
. O

I H
came O
to O
find O
out H
the O
person H
was O
the O
hotel N
OWNER H
also O
. O

My H
friend H
and O
I H
were O
to O
stay O
here O
for O
a O
girls H
night N
, O
catch O
up O
on O
our H
lives O
evening N
. O

We H
live O
within O
20 O
miles N
of O
the O
hotel N
and O
wanted O
to O
get O
away O
from O
our H
responsibilities N
for O
the O
night N
. O

Unfortunalty O
my H
husband H
and O
I H
had O
to O
put O
our H
13 O
year N
old O
lab N
down O
that O
morning N
and O
we H
were O
not O
expecting O
this O
. O

My H
friend H
called O
the O
hotel N
to O
cancel O
our H
room N
as O
soon O
as O
I H
called O
her O
. O

They O
said O
that O
we H
were O
to O
be O
charged O
for O
this O
room N
regardless O
because O
we H
did O
not O
cancel O
within O
the O
72 O
hours N
. O

I H
called O
them O
back O
a O
few O
hours N
after O
putting O
my H
Bodhi O
down O
and O
they O
still O
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
budge O
. O

Times O
are O
hard O
, O
I H
know O
, O
but O
they O
had O
no O
compassion N
. O

I H
called O
3 O
times N
to O
talked O
to O
a O
manager H
, O
never O
a O
call O
back O
. O

I H
emailed O
4 O
times N
, O
never O
a O
response N
. O

In O
one N
of O
the O
emails N
I H
attached O
the O
letter N
from O
the O
Vet's O
Vet H
's H
that O
expressed O
their O
sympathy N
, O
this O
hotel N
did O
nothing N
. O

I H
even O
emailed O
Mackinaw O
Tourist O
and O
nothing N
. O

I H
am O
sure O
this O
is O
a O
good O
place N
to O
stay O
from O
reading O
the O
other O
reviews N
, O
but O
if O
something O
unexpected O
happens O
in O
your H
life N
, O
they O
will O
not O
care N
. O

FANFUCKINGTASTIC O

Ok O
I H
am O
a O
New H
Yorker O
who O
has O
been O
going O
to O
school N
in O
Oxford O
, O
England O
. O

I H
thought O
the O
UK O
was O
completely O
devoid O
of O
good O
NYC O
style N
pizza N
. O

I H
thought O
to O
get O
a O
decent O
pizza N
the O
only O
way N
was O
at O
a O
fancy O
restaurant N
, O
and O
I H
have O
to O
get O
a O
whole O
pie N
. O

I H
thought O
I H
would O
have O
to O
wait N
until O
I H
went O
home N
to O
NYC O
. O

Well O
then O
I H
went O
on O
a O
trip N
to O
Glasgow O
and O
was O
walking O
around O
. O

I H
saw O
this O
place N
and O
it O
looked O
like O
the O
HOLY O
GRAIL N
. O

I H
knew O
I H
had O
found O
the O
real O
deal O
, O
big O
pies N
, O
sold O
by O
the O
slice N
, O
with O
the O
pizzas N
sitting O
under O
the O
glass N
in O
the O
front N
. O

They O
have O
crushed O
red O
pepper A
flakes N
and O
oregano A
. O

So O
I H
ordered O
a O
slice N
. O

It O
tasted O
like O
I H
just O
flew O
back O
home N
. O

I H
dunno O
du O
n O
no O
how O
they O
did O
it O
, O
but O
Scottish O
friends H
--- O
this O
is O
THE O
REAL O
DEAL N
. O

I H
congratulated O
this O
establishment N
for O
doing O
the O
research N
on O
making O
NYC O
pizza N
because O
these O
Scots O
fcking O
nailed O
it O
. O

That O
being O
said O
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
their O
delivery N
service N
is O
. O

They O
might O
want O
to O
change O
the O
name N
to O
reflect O
the O
new O
yorkedness O
of O
the O
pizza N
, O
scrummy O
yummy O
sounds N
gimmicky O
to O
me H
. O

Good O
food N
, O
good O
wait N
staff N
, O
poor O
management N

We H
visited O
on O
7/26/08 O
for O
dinner N
We H
received O
a O
gift N
certificate N
for O
the O
Mama H
Mia's O
Mia O
's H
on O
Greenfield O
Ave O
. O

The O
food N
was O
good O
, O
and O
so O
was O
our H
waitress H
. O

When O
it O
came O
time N
to O
pay O
the O
bill N
up O
front N
, O
they O
would O
not O
let O
me H
use H
any O
of O
the O
certificate N
for O
a O
tip N
( O
which O
I H
have O
done O
with O
any O
other O
restaurant N
I've O
I H
've O
gotten O
a O
gift N
certificate N
for O
. O
) O

I H
then O
asked O
if O
I H
could O
have O
money N
back O
in O
cash N
. O

The O
person H
went O
to O
go O
check O
with O
the O
manager H
, O
who O
was O
sitting O
at O
a O
table N
chatting O
with O
her O
friends H
who O
were O
eating O
there O
. O

Her O
answer N
was O
short O
and O
manner N
rather O
rude O
. O

Sorry O
for O
interrupting O
I H
guess O
. O

The O
cashier H
was O
also O
short O
, O
unapologetic O
and O
made O
me H
feel O
as O
I H
was O
wasting O
her O
time N
. O

There O
were O
no O
other O
options N
available O
( O
I H
only O
brought O
my H
check O
card N
to O
cover O
any O
overage N
cost O
) O
and O
she O
rang O
it O
up O
and O
applied O
it O
to O
the O
gift N
card N
before O
telling O
me H
about O
the O
tip N
policy N
. O

I H
will O
not O
be O
visiting O
Mama H
Mia's O
Mia H
's H
again O
. O

There O
are O
other O
places N
with O
food N
just O
as O
good O
with O
management N
that O
values N
customers H
and O
employees H
much O
more O

deffly O
better O
than O
the O
pizza N

its O
it O
s H
like O
a O
pizza N
roll O
, O
but O
they O
just O
toss O
ham O
and O
cheese N
inside O
. O

it O
seems O
like O
its O
it O
s H
healthier O
too O
, O
but O
its O
it O
s H
prolly O
not O
. O

also O
, O
you H

add O
pure O
delicious O
extract N
to O
the O
mix N
. O

their O
pizza N
was O
a O
little O
salty O
for O
me H
, O
but O
its O
it O
s H
still O
good O
. O

they O
do O
that O
whole O
thing N
where O
you H
sandwich N
the O
pepperoni N
between O
layers N
of O
cheese N
for O
+ O
32 O
delicious O
. O

anyways O
, O
the O
mezza O
luna A
: O
you H
should O
try O
it O
. O

it O
runs O
you H
about O
4 O
bucks N
and O
it O
deals N
crushing O
blows O
to O
hunger N

Edit O
: O
Living O
on O
campus N
at O
Clarkson O
University N
, O
I H
have O
had O
food N
delivered O
before O
. O

This O
was O
back O
between O
'05 O
and O
'09 O
and O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
remember O
how O
many O
times N
we've O
we H
've O
had O
it O
delivered O
. O

Perhaps O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
deliver O
anymore O
, O
but O
the O
deliciousness N
of O
a O
mezza O
luna A
certainly O
warrants O
a O
pickup H
. O

My H
2004 O
x O
- O
type N
was O
getting O
close O
to O
100,000 O
miles N
so O
it O
was O
time N
for O
an O
upgrade N
. O

I H
sent O
my H
wife H
and O
daughter H
over O
to O
check O
out H
a O
pre-owned O
2009 O
XF O
. O

Michael H
Chestney O
was O
very O
pleasant O
and O
patient H
with O
my H
wife H
and O
she O
suggested O
I H
go O
check O
it O
out H
. O

I H
went O
in O
later O
that O
afternoon N
and O
met O
with O
Michael H
. O

He O
showed O
me H
the O
car N
I H
was O
interested O
in O
and O
we H
took O
a O
test N
drive O
. O

I H
loved O
the O
car N
so O
we H
began O
negotiating O
my H
trade N
- O
in O
and O
the O
price N
of O
the O
09 O
XF O
. O

The O
entire O
negotiation N
took O
about O
20 O
minutes N
. O

Fair O
give O
and O
take O
on O
both O
sides N
until O
we H
agreed O
on O
a O
deal O
that O
was O
within O
my H
parameters N
and O
was O
fair O
to O
both O
sides N
. O

10 O
minutes N
of O
paperwork N
and O
I H
was O
the O
owner H
of O
a O
beautiful O
pre-owned O
09 O
XF O
. O

I H
have O
purchased O
over O
15 O
vehicles N
( O
cars N
, O
rvs N
, O
and O
boats N
) O
in O
my H
lifetime N
and O
I H
have O
to O
say O
the O
experience N
with O
Michael H
and O
Barrett H
Motor O
Cars O
of O
San O
Antonio H
was O
one N
of O
the O
best O
. O

Friendly O
, O
knowledgeable O
, O
and O
above O
all O
fair O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
all O
you H
can O
really O
ask O
from O
a O
car N
dealer H
and O
Michael H
and O
Barrett H
hit O
all O
3 O
. O

Thanks N
for O
the O
great O
deal O
and O
the O
great O

Identity N
Theft N

Myself H
and O
my H
fiance's O
fiance H
's H
identity N
was O
stolen O
from O
the O
office N
staff N
. O

We H
were O
told O
by O
a O
detective H
and O
asked O
to O
check O
our H
credit N
for O
anything O
unusual O
. O

Luckily O
they O
caught O
the O
crooks H
before O
they O
did O
one N
on O
us H
. O

It O
was O
a O
black O
female O
that O
use H
to O
work N
in O
the O
office N
. O

She O
stole O
the O
information N
and O
gave O
it O
to O
another O
guy H
that O
did O
all O
the O
work N
. O

The O
other O
guy H
was O
pulled O
over O
one N
day N
and O
a O
cop O
saw O
suspicious O
papers N
with O
names N
and O
social O
security N
numbers N
on O
it O
. O

Thats O
That O
s H
how O
they O
were O
caught O
. O

They O
both O
went O
to O
jail N
and O
a O
new O
manager H
was O
put O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
apartments N
. O

The O
apartment N
across O
from O
mine H
belonged O
to O
a O
gang N
of O
hookers H
. O

Nobody O
lived O
there O
. O

A H
girl H
would O
show O
up O
, O
then O
a O
guy H
in O
a O
nice O
car N
would O
show O
up O
. O

Short O
time N
later O
the O
guy H
would O
leave O
, O
then O
the O
girl H
leave O
. O

My H
apartment N
was O
usually O
quiet N
. O

I H
lived O
in O
one N
that O
did O
not O
face N
the O
parking O
lot N
. O

Parking N
spaces N
are O
just O
big O
enough O
for O
a O
Mini O
Cooper O
. O

It O
sucked O
having O
an O
SUV N
. O

If O
I H
found O
a O
spot N
, O
I H
couldnt O
could O
nt O
fit O
in O
it O
. O

Gates H
worked O
30 O
% O
of O
the O
time N
at O
best O
. O

Bugs A
were O
a O
small O
problem N
, O
nothing N
too O
bad O
. O

The O
best O
there O
is O
in O
service N
. O

I H
was O
recently O
traveling O
down O
I H
- O
24 O
from O
Nashville O
with O
my H
3 O
young O
children H
and O
had O
a O
blowout N
on O
the O
southeast O
side N
of O
Murfreesboro O
. O

It O
was O
4:50 O
when O
a O
friend H
told O
me H
to O
call O
Bud H
, O
he O
would O
take O
care N
of O
me H
. O

Not O
only O
did O
they O
answer N
the O
phone N
at O
4:50 O
on O
a O
Thursday O
, O
they O
hit O
the O
ground N
moving O
!. O

They O
tracked O
down O
the O
only O
tire N
that O
fit O
my H
BMW O
330i O
in O
Murfreesboro O
within O
minutes N
and O
secured O
it O
, O
then O
they O
came O
out H
, O
took O
off O
my H
tire N
( O
it O
was O
a O
runflat O
- O
but O
runflats O
don't O
do O
n't O
do O
you H
any O
good O
if O
they O
blow O
out H
) O
, O
and O
brought O
it O
to O
their O
shop N
to O
change O
the O
tire N
. O

They O
were O
back O
quickly O
considering O
how O
far O
outside O
of O
Murfreesboro O
we H
were O
and O
had O
us H
on O
our H
way N
by O
6:30 O
that O
evening N
. O

Thanks N
Bud H
for O
all O
of O
your H
help O
and O
taking O
time N
away O
from O
your H
family H
that O
evening N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
without O
a O
doubt O
, O
the O
best O
service N
experience N
I've O
I H
've O
ever O
had O
and O
just O
to O
be O
clear N
, O
the O
price N
he O
charged O
me H
was O
the O
same O
as O
my H
tire N
guy H
in O
Nashville's O
Nashville O
's H
price N
for O
putting O
on O
the O
other O
rear O
tire N
. O

I H
hope O
I H
can O
return O
the O
favor N
in O
the O
future N
! O

Service O
and O
Client H
base N
not O
ok O
. O

I H
have O
stayed O
in O
this O
hotel N
many O
times N
, O
and O
while O
it O
typically O
offers O
a O
decent O
bang N
for O
the O
buck N
, O
its O
client H
base N
largely O
consists O
of O
troubled O
youngsteers H
and O
evictees O
from O
the O
local O
, O
not O
so O
pleasant O
hood N
. O

I H
have O
never O
considered O
this O
a O
real O
problem N
as O
I H
travel O
without O
kids H
and O
can O
fend O
for O
myself H
, O
but O
when O
I H
had O
to O
listen O
to O
a O
( O
non-violent O
) O
domestic O
fight N
that O
lasted O
from O
1 O
AM O
to O
5 O
AM O
during O
my H
last O
stay O
and O
I H
found O
out H
that O
the O
front N
desk N
was O
unmanned O
during O
night N
hours N
, O
my H
choice N
was O
to O
either O
waste O
tax N
payers H
money N
by O
calling O
for O
a O
yet O
another O
police N
dispatch N
to O
this O
hotel N
, O
or O
just O
get O
over O
it O
. O

I H
chose O
the O
later O
, O
but O
approached O
the O
front N
desk N
about O
the O
hotel N
policy N
to O
push O
over O
their O
responsibilities N
on O
local O
authorities H
, O
not O
to O
mention N
the O
good O
nights N
night N
s H
sleep O
i H
paid O
for O
but O
didnt O
did O
nt O
get O
. O

I H
was O
told O
management N
would O
call O
me H
back O
but O
still O
waiting O
for O
that O
call O
. O

I H
will O
probably O
stay O
here O
again O
because O
its O
it O
s H
cheap O
and O
I H
cant O
ca O
nt O
afford O
a O
better O
hotel N
, O
but O
do O
not O
look O
forward O
to O
it O
and O
would O
definitely O
not O
recommend O
this O
hotel N
for O
families N
or O
single O
female O
travellers H
. O

Was O
there O
this O
past N
weekend N
and O
the O
guy H
behind O
the O
counter N
yelled O
at O
me H
and O
my H
son H
because O
we H
believed O
he O
left O
the O
grandma H
slice N
in O
the O
oven N
a O
little O
too O
long O
and O
the O
cheese N
got O
all O
dried O
out H
and O
the O
slice N
tasted O
more O
like O
a O
cracker N
. O

He O
preceded O
to O
grab O
the O
slice N
off O
the O
countertop N
and O
throw O
it O
into O
the O
trash N
while O
yelling N
at O
me H
saying O
, O
" O
you H
do O
not O
order O
what O
you H
do O
not O
know O
about O
" O
and O
" O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
pizza N
is O
made O
" O
. O

It O
was O
very O
upsetting O
to O
see O
this O
kind N
of O
behavior N
especially O
in O
front N
of O
my H
four O
year N
old O
. O

He O
was O
in O
the O
process N
of O
making O
me H
a O
pie N
and O
when O
I H
got O
home N
, O
the O
pie N
was O
the O
worst O
I H
have O
ever O
seen O
. O

Cheese N
was O
falling O
off O
, O
so O
oily O
and O
greasy O
. O

I H
think O
he O
did O
it O
on O
purpose N
because O
of O
my H
simple O
request N
for O
another O
slice N
of O
grandma H
that O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
so O
well O
- O
done O
( O
actually O
, O
burnt O
) O
. O

I H
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
this O
place N
and O
I H
am O
reporting N
them O
to O
the O
better O
business N
bureau N
for O
such O
horrible O
customer H
relations N
and O
basically O
sabotaging O
my H
pizza N
and O
taking O
my H
$ O
25 O
. O

THIS O
STORY N
IS O
100 O
% O
TRUE O

That O
little O

Long O
Lines O
, O
Silly O
Rules N
, O
Rude O
Staff N
, O
Ok O
Food O

The O
first O
thing N
you H
notice O
when O
you H
arrive O
on O
location N
is O
that O
the O
waiting O
line N
literally O
goes O
out H
the O
door N
and O
spills O
into O
the O
parking O
lot N
. O

A H
restaurant N
with O
this O
many O
patrons H
willing O
to O
stand O
in O
line N
just O
to O
order O
tacos H
must O
be O
good O
, O
right O
? O

I H
mean O
, O
that's O
that O
's H
the O
way N
it O
works O
at O
amusement N
parks N
: O
the O
longest O
lines N
are O
at O
the O
best O
rides N
. O

Well O
, O
this O
may O
be O
an O
exception N
. O

The O
staff N
taking O
your H
order O
and O
" O
waiting O
" O
on O
you H
are O
very O
indifferent O
and O
have O
no O
sense N
of O
costumer H
service N
at O
all O
. O

I H
have O
gotten O
better O
results N
talking O
to O
COMCAST O
customer H
service N
than O
with O
these O
folks N
. O

And O
don't O
do O
n't O
even O
think O
about O
asking O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
manager H
because O
this O
guy H
is O
, O
and O
pardon N
my H
French O
, O
a O
jerk N
. O

If O
you H
have O
gotten O
through O
ordering O
, O
dealing O
with O
the O
rude O
staff N
and O
if O
you H
followed O
the O
dumb O
rules N
, O
you H
are O
finally O
presented O
with O
what O
you H
came O
for O
.. O
some O
tacos H
that O
are O
" O
ok O
, O
" O
but O
definitely O
not O
worth N
putting O
up O
with O
all O
the O
hassle N
. O

Save O
yourself H
the O
trouble N
and O
skip O
this O
place N
all O
together O
. O

I H
suggest O
you H
go O
up O
to O
Raging O
Taco O
& O
Raging O
Burrito O
a O
couple N
of O
blocks N
up O
the O

do O
not O
be O
put O
off O
by O
the O
one N
negative O
review N
on O
this O
page N

I H
can O
tell O
you H
we H
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
-- O
BT O
has O
taste N
memory N
and O
each O
time N
back O
the O
food N
was O
consistently O
delicious O
-- O
same O
dishes N
-- O
were O
consistent O
. O

Our H
friend H
is O
a O
world N
traveler H
and O
loves O
unpretentious O
dining N
experiences N
and O
inspired O
food N
. O

This O
chef H
knows O
what O
he O
is O
doing O

Treat O
yourself H
and O
go O
-- O
you H
will O
go O
back O
! O

I H
am O
a O
business N
owner H
in O
downtown N
Saratoga O
Springs O
and O
wish O
this O
restaurant N
was O
in O
our H
town N
! O

The O
affordable O
rent O
makes O
it O
possible O
for O
an O
inspired O
chef H
to O
serve O
his O
high O
quality N
fare N
at O
affordable O
prices N
! O

Unlike O
Saratoga O
. O

I H
rrly O
seek O
the O
cehf H
out H
to O
introduce O
myself H
-- O
but O
the O
second N
time N
we H
went O
-- O
i H
made O
a O
point N
of O
asking O
our H
wait N
person H
to O
introduce O
my H
friend H
and O
myself H
to O
the O
chef H
to O
tell O
him O
just O
how O
good O
our H
meals N
were O
. O

Cannot O
Can O
not O
wait N
to O
go O
gain O
. O

- O
R. O
Morris H
. O

I H
think O
that O
there O
the O
re O
pretty O
good O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
if O
you H
call O
for O
an O
appointment N
they O
won't O
wo O
n't O
tell O
you H
to O
call O
back O
a O
month N
later O
so O
you H
can O
then O
make O
one N
. O

They O
also O
don't O
do O
n't O
tell O
you H
that O
they're O
they O
're O
going O
to O
mail N
you H
an O
" O
application N
" O
to O
be O
admitted O
to O
be O
a O
patient H
. O

I H
feel O
that O
the O
way N
some O
doctors H
doctor H
s H
offices N
work N
around O
here O
is O
a O
little O
bit N
absurd O
so O
I'm O
I H
'm O
happy O
that O
these O
guys H
don't O
do O
n't O
do O
those O
two O
things N
in O
particlular O
. O

Usually O
you H
can O
be O
seen O
the O
same O
week N
or O
maybe O
the O
following O
week N
. O

The O
doctor H
did O
tell O
me H
that O
my H
male O
pattern N
baldness N
is O
due O
to O
my H
mothers H
mother H
s H
father H
because O
the O
gene N
is O
exclusively O
passed O
on O
through O
maternal O
line N
but O
that's O
that O
's H
a O
common O
misconception N
( O
http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm O
) O
. O

In O
general O
I H
would O
say O
that O
the O
staff N
is O
attentive O
and O
nice O
. O

But O
then O
again O
I H
was O
nice O
to O
them O
so O
that O
could O
have O
been O
why O
. O

Anyhow O
, O
after O
reading O
some O
of O
the O
other O
reviews N
it O
seems O
like O
some O
of O
the O
other O
reviewers H
are O
expecting O
mircles N
. O

If O
you H
want O
miracles N
you'll O
you H
'll O
have O
to O
go O
to O
21st O
St H
. O

It's O
It O
's H
a O
pretty O
typical O
primary O
care N
office N
but O
for O
the O
area N
it's O
it O
's H
very O
good O
. O

They O
don't O
do O
n't O
do O
certain O
things N
that O
are O
really O
annoying O
about O
other O
offices N

First O
trip N
to O
Canada O

I H
recently O
traveled O
to O
Canada O
on O
business N
and O
had O
a O
most O
excellent O
experience N
. O

I H
work N
for O
a O
large O
retail N
company N
recently O
expanding O
our H
operations N
into O
Canada O
and O
had O
to O
travel O
to O
ensure O
all O
of O
our H
computer N
network N
equipment N
was O
installed O
properly O
and O
on O
time N
. O

This O
can O
tend O
to O
be O
a O
stressful O
experience N
in O
itself O
let O
alone O
adding O
crossing O
boarders N
for O
the O
first O
time N
. O

I H
was O
very O
pleased O
to O
find O
my H
accommodations N
and O
the O
hotel N
staff N
to O
be O
a O
very O
calming O
and O
comforting O
part N
of O
my H
trip N
. O

I H
found O
the O
hotel N
to O
be O
amazingly O
clean O
, O
not O
to O
mention N
very O
well O
adorned O
with O
many O
pleasant O
surprises N
. O

From O
my H
first O
encounter N
at O
check O
in O
to O
my H
regrettable O
check O
out H
I H
found O
the O
staff N
and O
facility N
to O
exceed O
my H
expectation N
. O

I H
completely O
enjoyed O
my H
whole O
check O
in O
experience N
and O
was O
impressed O
with O
the O
friendliness N
and O
professionalism N
of O
the O
staff N
as O
well O
as O
the O
accommodations N
themselves O
. O

I H
will O
be O
traveling O
in O
this O
area N
in O
the O
future N
and O
you H
can O
be O
assured O
that O
this O
experience N
will O
be O
helpful O
in O
my H
choice N
of O
hotels N
and O
Novotel O
will O
be O
my H
first O
selection N
. O

Yes O
the O
parking O
can O
be O
a O
challenge N
but O
being O
from O
NJ O
I H
am O
no O
stranger H
to O
tight O
corners N
. O

Please O
pass O
my H
appreciation N
to O
the O
Staff N
and O
Management O
for O
their O
excellent O
hospitality N
and O
good O
spirits N
as O
it O
helped O
make O
a O
stressful O
trip N
enjoyable O
. O

Favorite O

Update N
: O
I H
had O
to O
add O
to O
my H
review N
. O

I H
was O
just O
in O
last O
night N
and O
had O
a O
chance N
to O
dine O
in O
their O
new O
dining N
room N
. O

AMAZING O
! O

I H
frequent O
this O
resturant N
on O
a O
weekly O
basis N
but O
usally O
only O
for O
lunch N
. O

Well O
I H
was O
in O
for O
a O
treat O
when O
I H
was O
greeted O
by O
the O
friendly O
girls H
at O
the O
counter N
who O
asked O
if O
my H
wife H
and O
I H
would O
like O
to O
sit O
in O
their O
" O
new O
" O
dining N
room N
. O

Right O
away O
they O
told O
us H
that O
it O
was O
the O
same O
great O
food N
with O
the O
same O
prices N
so O
off O
we H
went O
. O

We H
were O
greeted O
again O
and O
sat O
promptly O
. O

After O
looking O
at O
the O
menu N
and O
seeing O
the O
new O
menu N
items N
they O
had O
, O
we H
knew O
we H
were O
in O
for O
a O
treat O
! O

I H
had O
the O
Chicken N
Parmesan N
Dinner N
and O
my H
wife H
had O
the O
Shrimp H
Scampi N
Dinner N
. O

AMAZING O
! O

The O
portions N
were O
generous O
enough O
that O
we H
even O
took O
some O
home N
! O

I H
have O
to O
say O
the O
value N
of O
this O
place N
always O
amazes O
me H
. O

It's O
It O
's H
nice O
to O
see O
that O
even O
in O
the O
economy N
we H
can O
eat O
a O
place N
that O
has O
upscale O
service N
, O
amazing O
atmosphere N
, O
and O
Incredible O
food N
, O
but O
not O
break O
the O
bank N
while O
enjoying O
it O
! O

Bottom O
line N
is O
that O
when O
it's O
it O
's H
a O
small O
privatly O
owned O
resturant N
like O
this O
is O
you H
can O
tell O
that O
the O
owners H
and O
employees H
take O
pride N
in O
their O
product N
and O
service N
. O

Well O
Done O
! O

Great H
work N
and O
honest O
establishment N
! O

I H
typically O
have O
work N
done O
on O
my H
Jeep O
at O
the O
dealership N
, O
but O
it O
is O
6 O
years N
old O
now O
and O
getting O
charged O
dealership N
prices N
just O
didn't O
did O
n't O
seem O
cost O
effective O
anymore O
. O

I H
had O
tried O
out H
few O
place N
around O
the O
area N
and O
had O
been O
ripped O
off O
a O
few O
times N
. O

I H
had O
hear O
great O
things N
about O
Phet O
and O
G&G O
Automotive O
so O
I H
decided O
to O
give O
him O
a O
try O
. O

The O
service N
was O
excellent O
and O
personable O
. O

He O
checked O
out H
what O
I H
needed O
to O
have O
done O
told O
me H
what O
needed O
be O
fixed O
before O
he O
did O
any O
work N
and O
did O
great O
repair N
work N
. O

The O
price N
was O
actually O
lower O
than O
what O
I H
had O
anticipated O
and O
used O
to O
compared O
to O
other O
places N
, O
plus O
he O
showed O
me H
the O
work N
he O
did O
when O
I H
came O
in O
to O
pick O
up O
the O
car N
. O

Also O
, O
a O
week N
after O
the O
work N
, O
Phet O
called O
me H
up O
to O
see O
how O
my H
car N
was O
running O
and O
to O
let O
me H
know O
that O
they O
had O
accidentally O
overcharged O
me H
for O
part N
of O
the O
work N
and O
wanted O
to O
give O
me H
a O
refund N
for O
that O
amount N
. O

That O
is O
just O
unheard O
of O
these O
days N
! O

I H
grew O
up O
in O
a O
small O
town N
where O
you H
knew O
and O
trusted O
your H
mechanic H
and O
was O
really O
cynical O
about O
city N
auto N
repair N
shops N
since O
I H
moved O
here O
, O
but O
Phet O
has O
shown O
that O
there O
really O
are O
honest O
hard O
working O
mechanics N
around O
. O

He O
is O
my H
mechanic H
going O
forward O
! O

Our H
company N
is O
a O
high O
end N
designer H
handbag N
and O
fashion N
accessories N
company N
, O
thus O
we H
are O
certainly O
a O
niche N
market N
. O

We H
had O
been O
evaluating O
SEO O
providers H
for O
quite O
some O
time N
and O
finally O
decided O
to O
take O
the O
plunge N
with O
Stuart H
, O
and O
Ulistic O
. O

We H
made O
the O
decision N
for O
a O
couple N
of O
reasons N
. O

1 O
. O
Social O
Media O
. O

We H
were O
familiar O
with O
Search N
Engine N
Optimization N
strategies N
, O
but O
new O
nothing N
about O
Social O
Media O
- O
we H
just O
heard O
that O
it O
was O
the O
next O
big O
thing N
. O

2 O
. O
We H
really O
liked O
the O
fact N
that O
Stuart H
sets N
defined O
objectives N
and O
we H
meet O
once O
a O
month N
to O
go O
over O
our H
Key N
Performance N
Indicators N
. O

How O
has O
it O
gone O
so O
far O
? O

Well O
we H
have O
been O
working O
with O
Ulistic O
for O
1.5 O
months N
, O
and O
have O
100 O
people N
following O
our H
site N
on O
Facebook O
, O
and O
our H
web N
site N
, O
www.designofashion.com O
has O
seen O
a O
3 O
fold N
increase O
in O
traffic N
, O
which O
is O
significantly O
beating N
our H
expectations N
- O
SEO O
is O
a O
process N
that O
takes O
time N
and O
to O
get O
results N
this O
quickly O
is O
exceptional O
. O

We H
are O
absolutely O
confident O
that O
Stuart's O
Stuart H
's H
ethical O
and O
focused O
strategies N
will O
see O
these O
trends N
continue O
to O
grow O
, O
and O
our H
business N
will O
reap O
the O
rewards N
of O
this O
program N
. O

Finally O
, O
it O
must O
be O
said O
that O
Stuart H
is O
a O
fantastic O
person H
to O
work N
with O
, O
because O
of O
his O
solid N
strategies N
and O
equally O
as O
importantly O
because O
he O
is O
a O
genuinely O
good O
person H
and O
a O
great O
communicator H
. O

Excellent O
service N
and O
quality N

I H
had O
Hom O
- O
Excel O
replace O
most O
of O
the O
windows N
in O
my H
Tampa O
residence N
three O
years N
ago O
. O

The O
excellent O
windows N
have O
performed O
without O
any O
problems N
, O
but O
that's O
that O
's H
not O
why O
I'm O
I H
'm O
writing N
my H
review N
. O

Three O
weeks N
ago O
, O
burglars H
tried O
to O
gain O
entry N
into O
the O
rear O
of O
my H
home N
. O

The O
intruders H
slit O
the O
screen N
of O
the O
window N
. O

Next O
, O
they O
tried O
to O
force N
the O
window N
with O
a O
pry O
bar N
and O
then O
to O
break O
the O
window N
with O
a O
hammer N
. O

The O
window N
didn't O
did O
n't O
break O
! O

My H
next O
- O
door N
neighbor H
heard O
the O
noise N
and O
turned O
on O
a O
light N
, O
thankfully O
scaring O
the O
two O
miscreants H
away O
( O
they O
even O
left O
their O
hammer N
behind O
! O
) O
. O

I H
called O
Home O
- O
Excel O
the O
next O
day N
to O
order O
a O
replacement H
screen N
for O
the O
window N
, O
and O
was O
happily O
surprised O
when O
they O
said O
that O
they O
weren't O
were O
n't O
even O
going O
to O
charge O
me H
for O
the O
replacement H
screen N
... O
that O
it O
would O
be O
covered O
under O
their O
guarentee N
. O

Lo O
and O
behold O
, O
they O
replaced O
the O
screen N
( O
which O
had O
to O
be O
ordered O
) O
yesterday N
and O
didn't O
did O
n't O
charge O
me H
a O
dime N
. O

Their O
worker O
even O
cleaned O
3 O
of O
my H
windows N
and O
changed O
a O
lightbulb N
for O
me H
. O

In O
this O
day N
and O
age N
, O
it O
is O
so O
rare O
to O
find O
a O
company N
with O
such O
nice O
workers H
and O
such O
far O
ranging O
guarantee N
policies N
. O

I H
rarely O
write O
reviews N
such O
as O
this O
one N
, O
but O
they O
certainly O
deserve O
anyone's O
anyone O
's H
business N
! O

Friendly O
staff N
, O
but O
definitely O
some O
problems N

May O
, O
2009 O
. O

We H
were O
booked O
at O
the O
Sheraton O
with O
a O
number N
of O
other O
out H
- O
of O
- O
town N
wedding N
guests H
. O

Got O
put O
into O
the O
wrong O
room N
the O
first O
night N
, O
and O
were O
quite O
surprised O
to O
have O
someone H
with O
the O
same O
room N
key N
trying O
to O
get O
in O
the O
door N
at O
1:00 O
am O
! O

Next O
day N
got O
moved O
into O
another O
room N
, O
on O
the O
same O
floor N
with O
other O
wedding N
guests H
. O

There O
were O
3 O
adults H
in O
our H
room N
but O
towels N
for O
only O
2 O
, O
no O
linens N
for O
sofa N
bed N
. O

In O
the O
second N
room N
it O
took O
3 O
tries O
to O
get O
all O
the O
towels N
and O
linens N
we H
requested O
. O

A H
package N
and O
some O
wedding N
cards N
were O
left O
in O
our H
first O
room N
. O

They O
were O
sent O
to O
our H
second N
room N
and O
had O
been O
opened O
-- O
the O
ribbon N
- O
wrapped O
present N
, O
and O
all O
3 O
envelopes N
. O

Security N
in O
the O
hotel N
seemed O
to O
be O
excellent O
, O
but O
we H
were O
never O
given O
an O
explanation N
as O
to O
why O
someone H
would O
open O
these O
items N
. O

A H
mid-afternoon O
" O
fire N
drill N
" O
was O
disruptive O
, O
putting O
everyone O
out H
of O
the O
hotel N
. O

When O
we H
called O
the O
front N
desk N
about O
an O
extremely O
boisterous O
crowd N
in O
the O
hall N
outside O
our H
door N
quite O
late O
at O
night N
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
take O
the O
hotel N
staff N
quite O
a O
while O
to O
quiet N
them O
down O
. O

The O
staff N
was O
friendly O
, O
especially O
the O
front N
desk N
female O
supervisor H
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
want O
to O
help O
, O
but O
too O
many O
unusual O
things N
happened O
to O
make O
us H
want O
to O
stay O
there O
again O
. O

Be O
Careful O
Of O
Who O
Your H
Sales N
Guy H
Is O

I H
think O
this O
place N
is O
probably O
really O
great O
especially O
judging O
by O
the O
reviews N
on O
here O
. O

My H
experience N
was O
awful O
though O
. O

It O
ALL O
had O
to O
do O
with O
the O
sales N
guy H
which O
was O
a O
young O
22 O
year N
old O
who O
had O
admittedly O
only O
been O
working O
for O
2 O
weeks N
. O

I H
was O
extremely O
interested O
in O
the O
car N
and O
very O
likely O
would O
have O
bought O
it O
, O
but O
the O
sales N
guy H
I H
dealt O
with O
ruined O
the O
deal O
. O

Essentially O
, O
I H
told O
him O
I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
trust N
him O
cause N
he O
was O
a O
car N
salesman H
, O
but O
he O
got O
so O
incredibly O
offended O
at O
that O
statement N
that O
he O
had O
to O
go O
cry N
to O
another O
salesman H
and O
compose O
himself O
before O
coming O
back O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O
kid H
had O
a O
bad O
day N
or O
what O
, O
but O
I H
had O
to O
sit O
and O
apologize O
about O
nothing N
for O
10 O
minutes N
until O
he O
dropped O
the O
issue N
. O

After O
that O
, O
I H
just O
tried O
to O
ignore O
his O
lack N
of O
professionalism N
and O
test N
drive O
the O
car N
. O

I H
played O
dumb O
and O
asked O
him O
questions N
that O
I H
already O
knew O
the O
answers N
to O
and O
he O
responded O
with O
half O
truths N
and O
a O
few O
falsehoods N
. O

For O
instance N
I H
asked O
who O
owned O
Mazda O
and O
he O
said O
with O
confidence N
that O
was O
GM O
, O
which O
isn't O
is O
n't O
true O
. O

I H
mean O
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
care N
if O
he O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
know O
, O
but O
if O
he O
pretends O
to O
know O
and O
tells O
me H
BS N
to O
my H
face N
, O
there's O
there O
's H
no O
way N
I'm O
I H
'm O
going O
to O
trust N
him O
when O
matters N
turn O
to O
the O
price N
of O
the O
car N
and O
financing N
. O

The O
Worst O
Chinese O
I've O
I H
've O
Ever O
Had O

This O
is O
by O
far O
the O
worst O
chinese O
food N
I H
have O
ever O
had O
. O

The O
service N
stunk O
. O

I H
called O
in O
my H
order O
and O
upon O
arriving O
to O
pick O
it O
up O
, O
they O
got O
my H
order O
confused O
with O
someone H
elses O
else O
s H
. O

They O
helped O
about O
three O
other O
people N
before O
they O
offered O
to O
help O
me H
again O
. O

They O
also O
got O
my H
friends H
friend H
s H
order O
mixed O
up O
and O
wanted O
to O
charger O
her O
$ O
10 O
more O
than O
what O
she O
had O
wanted O
. O

She O
asked O
for O
the O
dinner N
combo N
and O
they O
gave O
her O
two O
dinner N
plates N
instead O
. O

We H
were O
standing N
in O
the O
store N
for O
20 O
minutes N
to O
simply O
pick O
up O
an O
order O
. O

Not O
to O
mention N
that O
the O
wait N
staff N
was O
about O
as O
pleasant O
as O
dealing O
with O
an O
angry O
bull A
. O

They O
were O
abrasive O
and O
rude O
- O
when O
they O
were O
the O
ones N
who O
messed O
everything O
up O
. O

We H
had O
to O
throw O
out H
about O
80 O
percent N
of O
our H
meals N
because O
the O
food N
tasted O
so O
horrible O
. O

I H
dont O
do O
nt O
know O
how O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
make O
orange N
chicken N
, O
sesame A
chicken N
and O
kung O
pao O
chicken N
as O
well O
as O
cheese N
puffs N
taste N
THAT O
bad O

The O
only O
thing N
that O
was O
edible O
was O
the O
steamed O
rice N
and O
the O
vegetable N
lo O

I H
will O
NEVER O

billion O
times N

have O
no O
idea N
how O
China O

1 O

in O

Terrible O
Service O

One O
of O
the O
worst O
experiences N
I've O
I H
've O
ever O
had O
with O
a O
auto N
repair N
shop N
. O

We H
took O
our H
vehicle N
in O
for O
a O
repair N
to O
the O
air N
conditioning N
. O

Approx O
4 O
months N
later O
, O
the O
compressor N
went O
out H
. O

We H
took O
it O
back O
in O
to O
have O
it O
repaired O
again O
, O
and O
less O
than O
a O
week N
later O
the O
second N
compressor N
went O
out H
. O

We H
went O
in O
for O
a O
third O
visit O
and O
they O
fixed O
it O
again O
, O
but O
this O
time N
when O
we H
picked O
up O
the O
car N
, O
the O
radio N
and O
clock N
did O
not O
work N
. O

So O
for O
the O
4th O
time N
in O
5 O
months N
and O
the O
third O
time N
in O
2 O
weeks N
, O
we H
brought O
the O
car N
back O
again O
. O

When O
we H
expressed O
our H
discontent N
to O
the O
manager H
( O
that's O
that O
's H
right O
, O
the O
manager H
) O
, O
did O
he O
say O
he O
would O
return O
some O
money N
, O
did O
he O
say O
he O
would O
give O
a O
discount N
on O
our H
next O
visit O
, O
did O
he O
just O
say O
" O
I'm O
I H
'm O
sorry O
" O
. O

Nope O
, O
none N
of O
the O
above O
. O

He O
stood O
there O
and O
told O
us H
how O
he O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
at O
fault N
. O

It O
was O
the O
fault N
of O
the O
parts N
supplier H
, O
and O
can O
we H
imagine O
how O
he O
felt N
having O
to O
put O
another O
2 O
hours N
of O
work N
in O
the O
car N
. O

And O
what O
did O
we H
expect O
... O
that O
he O
bench N
test N
every O
part N
. O

At O
no O
time N
during O
the O
conversation N
did O
the O
words N
, O
" O
I'm O
I H
'm O
sorry O
" O
ever O
come O
out H
of O
his O
mouth N
. O

I H
, O
nor O
anyone O
else O
in O
my H
family H
, O
will O
ever O
go O
to O
Sun O
Devil H
Auto O
again O
. O

Well O
, O
unless O
of O
course N
the O
third O
compressor N
he O
put O
in O
the O
car N
goes O
out H
. O

Do O
not O
use H
this O
company N
! O

I H
dropped O
off O
a O
sheet N
metal O
piece N
that O
I H
needed O
copied O
due O
to O
th O
it O
was O
needing O
to O
be O
replaced O
. O

I H
asked O
if O
they O
could O
copy N
the O
piece N
I H
dropped O
off O
. O

They O
said O
it O
would O
be O
made O
exactly O
like O
the O
one N
I H
needed O
to O
replace O
. O

I H
picked O
it O
up O
when O
it O
was O
finished O
and O
was O
charge O
30.00 O
. O

When O
I H
got O
to O
the O
job N
and O
tried O
to O
insert O
the O
new O
piece N
of O
metal O
IT N
WOULD O
NOT O
FIT O
!! O

I H
took O
the O
original O
piece N
of O
metal O
and O
rigged O
it O
to O
make O
due O
since O
I H
had O
to O
complete O
the O
job N
. O

I H
took O
the O
receipt N
and O
the O
metal O
that O
did O
not O
fit O
and O
asked O
Pomper O
for O
my H
money N
back O
. O

The O
girl H
at O
the O
desk N
was O
sooo O
rude O
I H
could O
not O
believe O
it O
! O

She O
told O
me H
she O
could O
not O
use H
the O
piece N
I H
was O
returning O
and O
the O
company N
would O
only O
put O
it O
in O
the O
trash N
so O
I H
could O
not O
return O
it O
. O

I H
explained O
I H
did O
not O
get O
what O
I H
paid O
for O
. O

She O
asked O
me H
to O
bring O
the O
original O
piece N
back O
and O
I H
told O
her O
I H
had O
to O
use H
it O
on O
the O
job N
. O

She O
told O
me H
that O
was O
to O
bad O
she O
would O
do O
nothing N
to O
help O
me H
since O
she O
could O
not O
use H
or O
resell O
the O
piece N
. O

I H
said O
I H
was O
going O
to O
trash N
it O
also O
and O
could O
I H
at O
least O
have O
a O
credit N
. O

With O
a O
smirk N
on O
her O
face N
she O
told O
me H
NO O
MONEY N
IS O
BEING O
RETURNED O
and O
THAT O
IS O
THE O
WAY N
IT N
WAS O
. O

DO O
NOT O
USE N
THIS O
COMPANY N
. O

There O
are O
to O
many O
people N
that O
need O
our H
business N
to O
have O
to O
put O
up O
with O
this O
unfair O
treatment N
!!!!! O

I H
would O
NEVER O
recommend O
this O
gym N
to O
anyone O
and O
unfortunately O
this O
is O
based O
solely O
on O
the O
owner's O
owner H
's H
own O
unprofessionalism O
. O

When O
I H
originally O
joined O
in O
January O
I H
only O
did O
so O
because O
I H
was O
told O
I H
would O
be O
able O
to O
cancel O
the O
12 O
month N
membership N
if O
I H
was O
to O
move O
away O
. O

I H
signed O
up O
with O
one N
of O
the O
staff N
who O
was O
very O
pleasant O
and O
professional O
. O

Actually O
working O
out H
there O
was O
good O
- O
the O
machines N
are O
nice O
and O
the O
classes N
are O
fun O
. O

The O
locker N
room N
is O
certainly O
lacking O
- O
I H
would O
never O
shower N
or O
change O
there O
. O

They O
need O
to O
update O
the O
locker N
rooms N
ASAP O
. O

Back N
to O
my H
poor O
rating O
- O
I H
was O
excepted O
to O
medical O
school N
and O
went O
in O
to O
cancel O
my H
membership N
as O
I H
was O
told O
I H
could O
do O
since O
I H
was O
moving O
away O
. O

The O
owner H
was O
VERY O
rude O
, O
accused O
me H
of O
not O
reading O
my H
contract N
, O
and O
basically O
told O
me H
to O
shut O
up O
when O
I H
was O
trying O
to O
ask O
questions N
to O
further O
understand O
the O
process N
of O
canceling O
my H
membership N
. O

I H
was O
able O
to O
cancel O
it O
but O
only O
after O
paying O
a O
$ O
50 O
fee N
( O
which O
the O
staff N
person H
who O
signed O
me H
up O
stated O
I H
would O
not O
have O
to O
pay O
if O
I H
had O
proof N
of O
moving O
) O
and O
being O
spoken O
to O
in O
a O
very O
belittling O
manner N
. O

I H
would O
understand O
if O
I H
was O
being O
treated O
this O
way N
by O
a O
staff N
member N
but O
the O
club's O
club N
's H
actual O
OWNER H
?! O

Bad O
for O
business N
. O

I H
was O
appalled O
. O

I H
will O
never O
recommend O
this O
gym N
to O
any O
woman H
. O

The O
equipment N
and O
classes N
aren't O
are O
n't O
good O
enough O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
rudeness N
from O
the O
staff N
!!! O

There O
are O
better O
places N
on O
the O
Cape N
- O
FITNESS O
500 O
! O

The O
Salon N
Experience O
from O
Hell O

I H
feel O
obligated O
to O
share O
this O
story N
. O

Right O
out H
of O
college N
I H
called O
the O
salon N
and O
explained O
my H
situation N
. O

Just O
graduated O
, O
just O
moved O
, O
not O
rich O
, O
and O
starting O
new O
job N
soon O
. O

I H
never O
got O
a O
price N
quote N
over O
the O
phone N
and O
they O
take O
your H
cc N
info N
just O
to O
make O
the O
appointment N
because O
if O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
show O
up O
, O
they'll O
they O
'll O
charge O
you H
. O

I H
had O
this O
ridiculous O
celebrity N
stylist H
from O
LA O
named O
Derrick H
. O

After O
he O
already O
put O
product N
on O
my H
hair N
he O
said O
" O
I H
should O
warn O
you H
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
expensive O
. O
" O

What O
was O
I H
supposed O
to O
do O
, O
say O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
afford O
you H
and O
walk O
out H
with O
crap N
all O
over O
my H
hair N
. O

I H
wanted O
to O
be O
very O
blonde O
and O
instead O
he O
pulled O
my H
root N
color N
throughout O
my H
whole O
hair N
which O
is O
a O
gross O
mousey O
brown O
. O

The O
other O
stylists H
around O
me H
kept O
pressuring O
me H
saying O
he's O
he O
's H
so O
wonderful O
, O
you're H
you H
're O
going O
to O
love O
your H
hair N
. O

$ O
400 O
later O
my H
jaw N
dropped O
when O
the O
receptionist H
told O
me H
the O
total N
. O

Derrick H
did O
a O
terrible O
job N
, O
was O
a O
complete O
jerk N
the O
entire O
time N
, O
and O
I H
had O
no O
warning N
as O
to O
the O
price N
. O

I H
cried O
the O
entire O
way N
home N
. O

He O
then O
" O
fixed O
" O
it O
for O
free O
but O
it O
still O
looked O
like O
crap N
. O

I H
will O
never O
go O
back O
. O

It O
was O
the O
salon N
experience N
from O
absolutely O
Hell O
. O

He O
also O
told O
me H
that O
he O
worked O
on O
the O
cast N
of O
will O
and O
grace N
and O
that O
they O
were O
all O
jerks H
. O

That's O
That O
's H
my H
favorite O
show O
of O
all O
time N
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
pretty O
sure O
for O
the O
cast N
that O
it O
was O
the O
other O
way N
around O
. O

Maybe O
he O
didn't O
did O
n't O
do O
a O
good O
job N
and O
they O
told O
him O
so O
. O

Absolute O
Nightmare N
! O

STAY O
AWAY O
! O

Very O
unhappy O
... O

Working O
with O
Rod H
Jacobsen O
was O
my H
first O
experience N
working O
with O
a O
CPA H
, O
so O
I H
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
expect O
. O

That O
said O
- O
he O
seemed O
to O
be O
doing O
well O
enough O
. O

However O
, O
then O
I H
asked O
to O
amend O
my H
return O
to O
apply O
a O
credit N
I H
had O
just O
become O
eligible O
for O
. O

I H
expected O
to O
pay O
for O
this O
service N
, O
but O
imagine O
my H
surprise O
when O
I H
received O
a O
bill N
for O
MORE O
than O
what O
I H
paid O
to O
have O
the O
original O
return O
prepared O
. O

Asked O
why O
, O
Rod H
simply O
told O
me H
that O
he O
had O
to O
research N
how O
to O
do O
the O
amendment N
( O
it O
was O
an O
amended O
to O
show O
that O
I H
had O
purchased O
a O
home N
- O
nothing N
out H
of O
the O
ordinary O
, O
one N
would O
think O
) O
and O
that O
took O
time N
to O
figure O
out H
. O

Well O
, O
that O
was O
strike N
one N
. O

I H
wasn't O
was O
n't O
going O
to O
use H
them O
again O
, O
but O
I H
was O
going O
to O
leave O
it O
at O
that O
. O

However O
, O
now O
that O
I H
have O
come O
to O
realize O
that O
I H
am O
going O
to O
owe O
the O
IRS O
$ O
6,000 O
+ O
despite O
doing O
exactly O
what O
Rod H
told O
me H
to O
do O
, O
I H
feel O
I H
have O
to O
voice H
my H
opinion N
. O

Last O
year N
, O
after O
all O
was O
said O
and O
done O
, O
I H
asked O
Rod H
whether O
my H
payment N
structure N
would O
leave O
me H
with O
no O
/ O
little O
tax N
liability N
at O
the O
end N
of O
the O
year N
. O

He O
said O
yes O
. O

Well O
, O
again O
, O
I H
am O
now O
faced O
with O
a O
tax N
bill N
of O
$ O
6,000 O
+ O
, O
all O
due O
on O
April O
15 O
, O
2010 O
and O
all O
that O
Rod H
has O
to O
say O
to O
the O
matter N
is O
' O
well O
, O
you H
won't O
wo O
n't O
have O
to O
pay O
a O
penalty N
. O
' O

I H
may O
not O
have O
to O
pay O
a O
penalty N
, O
yet O
, O
but O
this O
is O
NOT O
what O
I H
had O
in O
mind N
when O
hired O
these O
guys H
. O

In O
the O
words N
of O
my H
new O
accountant H
, O
THEY O
LET O
ME H
DOWN O
! O

Bit N
sketchy O
, O
sporadic O
delivery N
times N

I H
bought O
about O
half O
of O
the O
furniture N
I H
own O
from O
this O
place N
. O

Why O
? O

Because O
they O
cut O
me H
good O
deals N
if O
I H
paid O
in O
cash N
. O

Sketchy O
, O
right O
? O

Well O
they O
came O
through O
and O
delivered O
almost O
all O
of O
my H
items N
within O
a O
few O
days N
. O

( O
They O
even O
got O
me H
a O
couch N
pretty O
quickly O
. O
) O

The O
guy H
who O
was O
cutting N
me H
the O
deals N
and O
getting O
me H
the O
furniture N
quickly O
, O
Ahmed H
, O
was O
nice O
and O
mostly O
professional O
, O
except O
the O
semi-sketchiness O
. O

Then O
one N
day N
, O
Ahmed H
left O
the O
country N
, O
not O
to O
return O
for O
months N
, O
WITHOUT O
informing O
me H
. O

He O
also O
neglected O
to O
tell O
the O
other O
person H
working O
at O
the O
store N
about O
a O
dining N
room N
table N
that O
I H
had O
ordered O
and O
that O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
coming O
in O
. O

The O
other O
person H
working O
at O
the O
store N
didn't O
did O
n't O
know O
that O
I H
still O
had O
this O
table N
coming O
. O

I H
had O
paid O
in O
cash N
, O
and O
he O
said O
he O
had O
no O
receipt N
/ O
record N
of O
my H
purchase N
. O

I H
came O
back O
with O
the O
receipt N
Ahmed H
had O
provided O
upon O
my H
purchase N
, O
and O
the O
guy H
took O
forever O
to O
copy N
it O
but O
said O
that O
he O
would O
take O
care N
of O
the O
situation N
. O

I H
waited O
. O

And O
waited O
. O

He O
never O
once O
contacted O
us H
. O

I've O
I H
've O
had O
to O
pester O
this O
new O
guy H
several O
times N
to O
ask O
when O
my H
table N
will O
arrive O
. O

He O
kept O
saying O
different O
arrival H
/ O
delivery N
dates O
and O
didn't O
did O
n't O
seem O
terribly O
apologetic O
. O

It O
has O
been O
3 O
weeks N
and O
I H
STILL O
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
my H
table N
( O
which O
was O
NOT O
cheap O
, O
I H
might O
add O
) O
. O

Point O
is O
: O
You H
might O
be O
able O
to O
get O
a O
good O
deal O
on O
some O
nice O
furniture N
-- O
which O
I H
did O
-- O
but O
they're O
they O
're O
not O
very O
communicative O
and O
god A
forbid O
something O
goes O
wrong O
, O
you'll O
you H
'll O
have O
to O
fight N
to O
get O
it O
resolved O
. O

Poor O
Service O

Run O
don't O
do O
n't O
walk O
. O

My H
experience N
with O
Home O
Delivery O
Service O
has O
been O
one N
of O
disappointment N
and O
anger N
. O

If O
I H
could O
give O
them O
a O
lower O
rating O
than O
poor O
I H
would O
. O

On O
August O
21st O
, O
2009 O
I H
ordered O
furniture N
from O
Hickory O
Furniture O
Mart O
and O
contracted O
for O
HDS O
to O
deliver O
it O
. O

After O
seventeen O
days N
the O
delivery N
van N
showed O
up O
at O
my H
home N
minus O
two O
pieces N
. O

I H
was O
later O
told O
they O
had O
been O
left O
at O
the O
warehouse N
and O
some O
future N
date N
they O
would O
be O
delivered O
. O

No O
one N
will O
give O
me H
a O
date N
. O

I H
spent O
$ O
2300 O
on O
the O
bedroom N
suite N
, O
which O
was O
complete O
and O
excellent O
condition N
on O
the O
showroom N
floor N
. O

Upon O
delivery N
it O
was O
clear N
the O
entire O
set O
was O
damaged O
: O
a O
piece N
of O
wood N
was O
broke O
on O
the O
headboard N
; O
the O
chest N
of O
drawers N
was O
missing O
all O
four O
pieces N
necessary O
to O
attach O
the O
legs N
; O
the O
dresser N
back O
legs N
were O
pushed O
in O
causing O
the O
dresser N
to O
lean O
into O
the O
wall N
; O
and O
a O
nighstand O
was O
missing O
a O
drawer N
. O

How O
do O
you H
lose O
a O
drawer N
. O

After O
complaining O
on O
September O
10th O
to O
National O
Home O
Furnishings O
, O
Boyles O
, O
the O
Hickory O
Furniture O
Mart O
and O
Home O
Delivery O
Service O
the O
latter N
finally O
called O
me H
back O
and O
said O
they O
would O
be O
up O
to O
pick O
the O
dresser N
and O
chest N
of O
drawers N
at O
some O
future N
point N
and O
at O
some O
later O
point N
it O
would O
be O
professional O
repaired O
and O
at O
some O
later O
point N
it O
would O
be O
returned O
. O

The O
customer H
service N
at O
Home O
Delivery O
Service O
was O
terrible O
let O
alone O
their O
promise N
to O
proper O
set O
up O
furniture N
. O

So O
I H
am O
in O
limbo N
regarding O
a O
bedroom N
suite N
. O

I H
hope O
the O
owners H
and O
employees H
of O
this O
store N
have O
broken O
bedroom N
suites N
in O
their O
homes N
and O
furniture N
sitting O
in O
someone's O
someone H
's H
warehouse N
. O

Maybe O
then O
they O
will O
begin O
to O
understand O
poor O
customer H
service N
and O
terrible O
sit O
up O
service N
. O

Excellent O
Driving O
School N

I H
was O
involved O
in O
a O
car N
accident N
20 O
years N
ago O
and O
since O
then O
I've O
I H
've O
been O
a O
nervous O
wreck N
and O
haven't O
have O
n't O
been O
behind O
the O
wheel N
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
a O
family H
emergency N
required O
me H
to O
conquer O
this O
fear N
. O

A H
very O
good O
friend H
of O
mine H
highly O
recommended O
the O
Professional O
Driving O
School N
and O
I H
was O
told O
to O
specifically O
ask O
for O
Gerry H
. O

She O
highly O
recommended O
him O
and O
described O
him O
as O
the O
" O
Saintly O
Instructor H
and O
Simply O
the O
Best O
Instructor H
there O
is O
.... O
very O
calm O
, O
pleasant O
and O
very O
detailed O
in O
giving O
instructions N
" O
. O

I H
called O
the O
school N
most O
probably O
10 O
times N
before O
I H
finally O
enrolled O
in O
a O
20 O
hour N
package N
. O

I H
had O
to O
cancel O
my H
initial O
lesson N
4 O
times N
and O
on O
the O
5th O
attempt N
the O
management N
was O
quick O
enough O
to O
associate O
my H
cancellations N
with O
my H
fear N
and O
finally O
encouraged O
me H
into O
taking O
my H
initial O
lesson N
. O

Five O
minutes N
before O
my H
initial O
lesson N
, O
I H
got O
a O
call O
from O
Gerry H
advising O
me H
of O
his O
arrival H
and O
to O
come O
down O
as O
soon O
as O
I H
was O
ready O
. O

My H
heart N
pounded O
as O
I H
walked O
down O
and O
pounded O
even O
faster O
upon O
seeing O
Gerry H
in O
an O
SUV N
- O
Lexus O
! O

I H
thought O
of O
canceling O
the O
lesson N
once O
again O
because O
I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
feel O
comfortable O
driving O
an O
SUV N
. O

Gerry H
pleasantly O
said O
" O
since O
I H
am O
already O
here O
why O
don't O
do O
n't O
we H
give O
it O
shot N
. O

I H
trust N
you H
and O
believe O
that O
you'll O
you H
'll O
be O
able O
to O
handle N
this O
and O
all O
you H
have O
to O
do O
is O
to O
reciprocate O
! O

Trust O
me H
and O
most O
especially O
trust N
and O
believe O
in O
yourself H
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
worry O
, O
I'll O
I H
'll O
take O
care N
of O
you H
! O
" O

....... O
the O
rest N
was O
history N

Here O
I H
am O
now O
driving O
confidently O
on O
my H

Gerry H

I H
can't O

you H
enough O
for O
helping O
me H

with O
my H

Review N
on O
House O
of O
Joy H
Chinese O
Restaurant O

My H
family H
and O
I H
moved O
to O
San O
Antonio H
a O
year N
ago O
and O
have O
tried O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
Chinese O
Restaurants N
because O
we H
love O
Chinese O
food N
. O

Well O
it O
took O
us H
a O
while O
to O
find O
one N
that O
we H
liked O
. O

But O
we H
don't O
do O
n't O
just O
like O
House O
of O
Joy H
WE H
LOVE O
IT N
. O

Everything O
we H
have O
gotten O
there O
has O
been O
more O
authentic O
and O
better O
tasting O
than O
any O
other O
Chinese O
restaurant N
in O
the O
San O
Antonio H
area N
we H
have O
been O
to O
-- O
and O
trust N
me H
we H
have O
been O
to O
a O
lot N
of O
them O
. O

We H
just O
happen O
to O
stumble O
across O
this O
little O
restaurant N
one N
day N
when O
we H
had O
to O
visit O
the O
Bexar O
County O
Tax O
Office O
off O
of O
Bandera O
Road O
. O

We H
stopped O
in O
and O
got O
some O
take O
out H
and O
cannot O
can O
not O
stop N
going O
back O
. O

They O
have O
the O
best O
Egg A
Drop O
Soup O
I H
have O
ever O
tasted O
. O

We H
also O
love O
their O
Egg A
Rolls N
and O
Spring N
Rolls N
. O

And O
every O
entree N
we H
have O
ordered O
is O
perfect O
. O

Everything O
is O
always O
cooked O
fresh O
and O
tastes O
fresh O
. O

Their O
prices N
are O
extremely O
reasonable O
for O
the O
amount N
of O
food N
you H
receive O
. O

The O
staff N
is O
also O
just O
so O
pleasant O
to O
deal O
with O
. O

They O
are O
also O
quick O
at O
getting O
your H
order O
out H
to O
you H
. O

You H
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
sit O
and O
wait N
around O
forever O
like O
most O
places N
!! O

So O
anyone O
looking O
for O
an O
Excellent O
night N
out H
for O
Chinese O
or O
maybe O
just O
lunch N
should O
stop N
in O
and O
try O
it O
because O
I H
promise N
you H
2 O
things N
--- O
You H
won't O
wo O
n't O
regret O
it O
!! O

and O
you H
will O
go O
back O
for O
more O
!!! O

PS N
I H
have O
noticed O
on O
here O
that O
someone H
left O
a O
comment O
that O
" O
all O
of O
the O
nice O
comments N
must O
come O
from O
co O
workers H
or O
friends H
" O
and O
I H
will O
tell O
you H
that O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
these O
people N
except O
from O
eating O
at O
their O
restaurant N
. O

We H
are O
from O
Virginia H
and O
just O
moved O
here O
a O
year N
ago O
. O

So O
that O
comment O
is O
completely O
false O
. O

Because O
we H
think O
IT'S O
IT N
'S O
THE O
BEST O
!!! O

and O
we H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
them O
except O
for O
eating O
there O
. O

Dr. O
Strzalka O
at O
Flagship O
CVTS O
is O
not O
a O
good O
doctor H

I H
am O
not O
sure O
about O
the O
quality N
of O
the O
other O
doctors H
there O
, O
but O
i H
do O
know O
from O
personal O
experience N
that O
Dr. O
Christopher H
T. O
Strzalka O
is O
not O
a O
man H
of O
his O
word N
, O
and O
is O
also O
very O
CRUEL O
AND O
UNCARING O
!! O

He O
was O
going O
to O
operate O
and O
replace O
my H
bicuspid O
aortic O
valve N
due O
to O
critical O
aortic O
stenosis N
. O

I H
had O
a O
surgery N
date N
of O
July O
17 O
, O
2008 O
. O

Then O
he O
renigged O
when O
he O
read O
my H
Health N
Care O
Proxy O
, O
even O
though O
i H
agreed O
to O
be O
on O
the O
ventilator N
for O
2 O
months N
following O
surgery N
( O
as O
he O
had O
twice O
stated O
i H
must O
agree O
to O
) O
. O

He O
later O
said O
that O
by O
2 O
months N
he O
" O
meant O
at O
least O
two O
months N
" O
. O

Two O
months N
and O
at O
least O
two O
months N
are O
totally O
different O
things N
. O

He O
did O
not O
even O
give O
me H
the O
chance N
to O
say O
i H
would O
stay O
on O
the O
ventilator N
longer O
, O
which O
i H
would O
have O
. O

A H
Health N
Care O
Proxy O
is O
not O
written O
in O
stone N
and O
can O
be O
changed O
. O

He O
also O
never O
even O
said O
he O
was O
sorry O
. O

Just O
said O
i H
was O
inoperable O
and O
walked O
out H
of O
the O
hospital N
room N
. O

So O
, O
therefore O
, O
now O
he O
says O
i H
am O
inoperable O
( O
even O
though O
i H
am O
not O
100 O
% O
inoperable O
) O
, O
and O
he O
is O
letting O
me H
die O
. O

I H
am O
just O
middle O
aged O
and O
do O
not O
want O
to O
die O
, O
but O
thanks N
to O
this O
doctor H
i H
have O
no O
other O
alternatives N
. O

I H
, O
along O
with O
my H
friends H
, O
consider O
this O
doctor H
to O
be O
the O
cause N
of O
my H
death N
as O
he O
is O
not O
even O
trying O
to O
save O
my H
life N
by O
operating O
. O

Even O
my H
PA O
i H
went O
to O
the O
other O
day N
said O
" O
it O
must O
by O
comforting O
to O
have O
gone O
to O
a O
heart N
surgeon H
like O
him O
who O
will O
do O
nothing N
for O
you H
" O
. O

He O
said O
it O
sarcastically O
. O

If O
you H
want O
a O
doctor H
who O
will O
lie O
to O
you H
and O
say O
he O
will O
operate O
and O
then O
change O
his O
mind N
, O
and O
not O
know O
what O
he O
is O
talking O
about O
when O
he O
recommends O
procedures N
at O
other O
hospitals N
and O
says O
they O
are O
what O
you H
need O
, O
when O
they O
will O
not O
work N
for O
you H
, O
go O
to O
this O
doctor H
... O
he O
is O
the O
one N
for O
you H
. O

What O
you H
can O
learn O
from O
the O
below O
' O
bad O
experience N
' O
. O

I H
would O
suggest O
not O
avoiding O
Second O
Home O
based O
on O
the O
' O
bad O
experience N
' O
review N
. O

I'd O
I H
'd O
probably O
be O
more O
inclined O
to O
board N
my H
two O
dogs A
here O
, O
seeing O
that O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
just O
take O
every O
dog A
coming O
in O
. O

I've O
I H
've O
toured O
this O
place N
and O
was O
impressed O
by O
how O
clean O
the O
place N
was O
, O
and O
all O
the O
options N
for O
the O
dogs A
. O

It's O
It O
's H
unfortunate O
that O
bmil O
believed O
that O
his O
' O
perfect O
' O
dog A
was O
not O
given O
the O
right O
opportunity N
to O
prove O
himself O
. O

But O
I've O
I H
've O
done O
hundreds N
of O
dog A
introductions N
myself H
( O
another O
place N
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
work N
here O
) O
, O
and O
owners H
can O
have O
unrealistic O
expectations N
and O
views N
of O
what O
they O
see O
when O
their O
dogs A
meet O
other O
dogs A
. O

Workers H
who O
do O
these O
introductions N
look O
at O
the O
interaction N
objectively O
; O
and O
it's O
it O
's H
good O
to O
see O
they O
are O
able O
and O
willing O
to O
say O
no O
if O
they O
feel O
there O
would O
be O
a O
problem N
. O

It O
sounds N
( O
according O
to O
your H
own O
statement N
) O
that O
they O
had O
a O
roomful N
of O
dogs A
, O
so O
they O
must O
be O
doing O
something O
right O
- O
and O
are O
keeping N
those O
dogs A
safe O
from O
potential N
problems N
. O

You H
say O
you H
work N
a O
lot N
, O
and O
that O
you H
have O
a O
young O
dog A
; O
so O
I H
have O
little O
doubt O
that O
your H
dog A
is O
just O
filled O
with O
energy N
to O
burn O
; O
and O
it O
is O
good O
of O
you H
to O
look O
for O
a O
place N
to O
take O
him O
. O

But O
not O
at O
a O
risk N
to O
other O
people's O
people N
's H
pets A
. O

You H
were O
clearly O
given O
another O
alternative O
by O
Second O
Home O
, O
to O
board N
him O
- O
which O
might O
have O
given O
your H
dog A
a O
chance N
to O
come O
and O
go O
from O
Second O
Home O
a O
couple N
times N
, O
getting O
used O
to O
the O
place N
and O
maybe O
facilitating O
another O
attempt N
to O
get O
into O
daycare N
later O
. O

No O
business N
is O
going O
to O
push O
customers H
away O
without O
good O
reason N
; O
so O
isn't O
is O
n't O
it O
reasonable O
to O
think O
they O
might O
know O
what O
they're O
they O
're O
doing O
? O

My H
dogs A
are O
far O
from O
perfect O
, O
and O
one N
of O
them O
I H
believe O
would O
be O
a O
little O
much O
for O
daycare N
here O
herself O
( O
at O
least O
initially O
) O
. O

Be O
a O
little O
more O
reasonable O
with O
your H
expectations N
of O
a O
place N
like O
this O
; O
and O
maybe O
don't O
do O
n't O
jump N
to O
personal O
attacks N
suggesting O
that O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
work N
hard O
, O
just O
because O
you H
bruised O
your H
own O
ego N
. O

Dumbest O
F'ers H
ever O

I H
called O
dominos O
tonight N
, O
it O
rang O

word N
and O
FINALLY O

I H
laugh O
and O
say O

, O
but O
I'm O
I H

And O

says O
: O

Pennsylvania O
? O

and O
I H
said O
, O
YES O

CENTER O

and O

says O
, O

, O
I'm O

Then O
why O
are O

calling O
here O
, O
we H
don't O
do O
n't O
go O
past N
broad O
? O

Anyway O
, O
after O
much O
yelling N
and O
cussing O
I H
hung O
up O
, O
grabbed O
a O
cab N
, O
and O
went O
to O
Geno's O
Geno O
's H
. O

Quick H
to O
take O
money N
but O
not O
quick O
to O
fix O
a O
problem N
! O

B&B O
came O
out H
very O
quickly O
to O
give O
us H
our H
quote N
back O
in O
June O
. O

They O
were O
very O
polite O
, O
eager O
to O
answer N
any O
questions N
and O
willing O
to O
wait N
for O
us H
to O
return O
from O
vacation N
to O
begin O
installing O
our H
fence N
. O

Our H
fence N
was O
installed O
quickly O
in O
August O
and O
they O
had O
their O
money N
and O
left O
saying O
" O
Workmanship N
is O
guaranteed O
for O
a O
year N
! O
" O
. O

Within O
a O
week N
we H
noticed O
one N
of O
the O
boards N
on O
our H
gate N
splitting O
where O
a O
nail N
had O
gone O
in O
. O

We H
called O
our H
representative O
who O
assured O
me H
he O
would O
call O
the O
office N
and O
have O
it O
taken O
care N
of O
. O

We H
heard O
nothing N
. O

We H
then O
called O
the O
office N
and O
the O
man H
we H
spoke O
to O
said O
he'd O
he O
'd O
send O
someone H
out H
to O
look O
at O
it O
but O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
promise N
when O
- O
two O
weeks N
came O
and O
went O
and O
we H
heard O
nothing N
. O

I H
just O
called O
again O
and O
was O
told O
that O
workmanship N
, O
not O
wood N
, O
is O
guaranteed O
for O
a O
year N
- O
well O
in O
my H
opinion N
- O
the O
wood N
split O
due O
to O
a O
nail N
which O
is O
part N
of O
workmanship N
! O

She O
even O
went O
so O
far O
as O
to O
say O
" O
Your H
You H
r O
calling O
about O
one N
board N
? O
" O

Well O
- O
when O
you H
pay O
over O
$ O
1000 O
for O
something O
you H
want O
it O
to O
hold O
up O
and O
look O
good O
!!! O

YES O
! O

I H
WAS O
calling O
about O
one N
board N
!! O

I'm O
I H
'm O
very O
frustrated O
at O
this O
point N
- O
it O
would O
take O
all O
of O
10 O
min N
for O
them O
to O
come O
by O
and O
replace O
the O
one N
board N
that O
is O
cracked O
( O
the O
crack O
is O
deep O
enough O
to O
stick N
a O
penny N
in O
it O
and O
it O
goes O
clear N
through O
) O
yet O
they O
do O
not O
want O
to O
take O
the O
time N
to O
bother O
with O
what O
once O
WAS O
a O
happy O
customer H
and O
has O
now O
become O
a O
dissatisfied O
customer H
. O

So O
I H
figure O
if O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
take O
the O
time N
to O
fix O
the O
fence N
that O
they O
installed O
then O
I'll O
I H
'll O
take O
the O
time N
to O
let O
everyone O
I H
can O
know O
about O
how O
they O
treat O
customers H
once O
they O
have O
your H
money N
!!! O

STAY O
AWAY O
!!! O

YOU H
GET O
WHAT O
YOU H
PAY O
FOR O
!!! O

They O
came O
in O
under O
a O
lot N
of O
other O
quotes N
and O
now O
I H
know O
why O
!!! O

When O
the O
fence N
was O
first O
installed O
I H
would O
have O
given O
them O
five O
stars N
, O
now O
for O
their O
poor O
customer H
follow O
- O
up O
and O
unwillingness N
to O
fix O
the O
fence N
they O
have O
dropped O
to O
a O
one N
- O
star N
in O
my H
opinion N
! O

Lots N
of O
rules N
, O
phantom A
innkeeper H
, O
last O
minute O
price N
was O
worth N
it O
. O

I H
called O
the O
" O
207 O
" O
number N
and O
listened O
to O
the O
same O
recording O
loop N
3 O
times N
before O
I H
gave O
up O
. O

I H
then O
called O
the O
800 O
number N
( O
which O
was O
answered O
) O
and O
inquired O
about O
last O
minute O
rates N
. O

They O
had O
a O
room N
with O
a O
$ O
99 O
rate N
, O
which O
I H
booked O
. O

The O
room N
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
on O
the O
2nd O
floor N
, O
but O
they O
put O
us H
on O
the O
3rd O
. O

The O
email N
confirmation N
( O
which O
I H
read O
in O
the O
car N
) O
warned O
about O
large O
suitcases N
, O
declaring O
that O
we H
are O
innkeepers H
, O
not O
longshoreman H
. O

In O
other O
words N
, O
they O
do O
not O
help O
with O
suitcases N
, O
but O
they O
promise N
totes N
to O
help O
. O

However O
upon O
our H
arrival H
no O
one N
there O
( O
the O
inn N
was O
open O
) O
. O

So O
no O
totes N
. O

Finally O
a O
chambermaid H
stuck O
her O
head N
around O
the O
corner N
from O
the O
top N
of O
the O
stairs N
and O
told O
us H
sternly O
that O
we H
could O
not O
be O
accommodated O
until O
3 O
M N
, O
no O
exceptions N
. O

Then O
she O
was O
gone O
. O

We H
returned O
after O
3 O
PM N
, O
found O
no O
one N
there O
, O
and O
a O
note N
from O
the O
innkeeper H
with O
directions N
to O
our H
room N

Quit O
with O
the O
overstatements N
! O

The O
worst O
thing N
that O
can O
happen O
for O
any O
restaurant N
like O
Zahav O
is O
to O
have O
too O
many O
people N
write O
hyperbolic O
reviews N
making O
claims N
that O
" O
everyone O
" O
is O
going O
to O
" O
love O
" O
the O
food N
, O
decor N
and O
service N
. O

The O
truth N
is O
, O
in O
my H
and O
my H
dining N
partners' O
partners H
' O
experience N
, O
this O
is O
a O
fine O
little O
restaurant N
with O
some O
unique O
food N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
an O
entirely O
up O
and O
down O
experience N
, O
however O
. O

Now O
, O
the O
best O
of O
that O
unique O
food N
comes O
at O
the O
very O
beginning O
of O
the O
meal N
. O

The O
salatim O
salads N
are O
the O
smallest O
plates N
I've O
I H
've O
ever O
seen O
placed O
in O
front N
of O
me H
( O
you H
would O
most O
likely O
think O
they O
were O
condiments N
if O
it O
weren't O
were O
n't O
explained O
to O
you H
) O
. O

Though O
they O
are O
mostly O
excellent O
, O
you H
generally O
don't O
do O
n't O
get O
enough O
forkfuls O
to O
know O
if O
you H
really O
love O
them O
. O

That O
being O
said O
, O
the O
laffa O
and O
hummus N
are O
out H
of O
this O
world N
. O

Then O
again O
, O
for O
the O
three O
of O
us H
who O
dined O
together O
, O
two O
pieces N
of O
flatbread N
left O
us H
fighting O
for O
more O
, O
and O
licking O
the O
hummus N
from O
our H
fingers N
( O
and O
yes O
, O
those O
two O
pieces N
of O
flatbread N
did O
represent O
a O
three O
- O
person H
order O
) O
. O

Dinner N
was O
also O
an O
up O
- O
and O
- O
down O
experience N
. O

The O
vegetarian O
dishes N
and O
lighter O
fare N
were O
almost O
always O
spot N
- O
on O
, O
while O
the O
lamb A
was O
often O
dry H
and O
/ O
or O
overcooked O
. O

The O
duck A
was O
a O
65 O
% O
glob N
of O
chewy O
fat O
with O
no O
resemblance N
to O
the O
juicy O
, O
crispy O
delicacy N
it O
usually O
represents O
at O
other O
establishments N
. O

Dessert N
was O
... O
hmmm O
, O
that's O
that O
's H
interesting O
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
even O
remember O
dessert N
. O

I H
guess O
that O
tells O
you H
a O
lot N
. O

Oh O
, O
yes O
, O
the O
chocolate N
semifreddo O
was O
quite O
good O
. O

The O
warm O
chocolate N
cake N
was O
very O
tasty O
, O
but O
served O
at O
room N
temperature N
, O
not O
warm O
by O
any O
stretch O
of O
the O
imagination N
. O

And O
my H
-- O
no O
, O
I H
still O
don't O
do O
n't O
remember O
what O
I H
had O
. O

Service O
was O
average O
, O
but O
nothing N
special O
, O
and O
restaurants N
that O
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
excellent O
should O
do O
a O
better O
job N
of O
training N
their O
waitstaff O
to O
be O
communicative O
and O
friendly O
, O
not O
merely O
capable O
. O

Perhaps O
had O
we H
not O
gone O
into O
this O
restaurant N
believing O
Zahav O
was O
going O
to O
be O
golden O
as O
its O
name N
suggests O
( O
and O
as O
the O
many O
golden O
reviews N
seem O
to O
attest O
) O
, O
we H
would O
have O
enjoyed O
a O
decent O
little O
expensive O
experience N
. O

But O
one N
should O
not O
go O
here O
expecting O
something O
fantastic O
, O
unless O
perhaps O
you've O
you H
've O
never O
had O
middle O
- O
eastern O
food N
before O
, O
or O
succulent O
duck A
, O
tasty O
lamb A
, O
decent O
portion N
sizes N
or O
actually O
warm O
chocolate N
desserts N
. O

PS N
) O
When O
we H
called O
for O
a O
reservation N
, O
we H
were O
told O
that O
5:00 O
and O
9:30 O
were O
their O
only O
openings N
. O

When O
we H
arrived O
at O
5 O
, O
and O
left O
circa O
7 O
, O
there O
were O
the O
same O
4 O
or O
5 O
empty O
tables N
surrounding O
us H
. O

Did O
they O
think O
we H
were O
going O
to O
feel O
lucky O
to O
get O
any O
reservation N
at O
all O
, O
and O
therefore O
be O
more O
pleased O
with O
our H
dining N
experience N
? O

MUST O
READ O
- O
Do O
not O
waste O
your H
time N
in O
this O
store N
. O

At O
my H
appointment N
the O
girl H
helping O
me H
was O
unable O
to O
adequately O
lace O
up O
some O
of O
the O
dresses N
. O

They O
felt N
like O
they O
were O
going O
to O
fall N
off O
of O
me H
and O
it O
was O
very O
difficult O
to O
see O
what O
I H
would O
actually O
look O
like O
were O
I H
to O
purchase N
some O
of O
these O
dresses N
. O

I H
thought O
it O
would O
be O
a O
good O
idea N
to O
see O
how O
a O
few O
that O
I H
liked O
would O
look O
like O
on O
a O
model N
( O
by O
looking O
the O
dress O
up O
online O
) O
. O

So O
, O
as O
I H
was O
leaving O
I H
asked O
for O
the O
designer H
/ O
dress O
name N
or O
style N
number N
associated O
with O
my H
top N
picks O
. O

They O
said O
they O
were O
" O
unable O
to O
tell O
me H
until O
they O
ordered O
my H
dress O
" O
. O

Hmmm O
... O
A H
person H
cannot O
can O
not O
call O
a O
company N
, O
if O
you H
have O
no O
idea N
its O
name N
( O
since O
the O
designer H
is O
unknown O
... O
SUPPOSEDLY O
) O
, O
and O
order O
a O
gown N
without O
a O
dress O
name N
or O
style N
number N
. O

Do O
other O
brides H
fall N
for O
this O
??? O

They O
either O
: O
a O
) O
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
give O
it O
to O
me H
because O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
me H
purchasing O
the O
dress O
elsewhere O
or O
b O
) O
are O
recreating O

Whatever O

I'm O

of O
the O
sales N
ladies H
was O
quite O
comfortable O
telling O
me H
how O
wrong O
I H
was O
about O
how O
another O
dress O
that O
I H
loved O
compared O
to O
one N
of O
her O
dresses N
that O
I H
was O
trying O
on O
. O

Somehow O
, O
since O
she O
supposedly O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
know O
any O
names N
of O
designers H
/ O
dresses N
, O
after O
I H
told O
her O
the O
designer H
and O
dress O
name N
of O
the O
one N
I H
was O
comparing O
, O
she O
knew O
" O
exactly O
which O
dress O
" O
I H
was O
referring O
to O
and O
disagreed O
with O
my H
observation N
; O
she O
said O
that O
the O
bodice N
did O
come O
as O
low O
as O
the O
one N
I H
had O
on O
. O

My H
point N
: O
Even O
if O
I H
was O
wrong O
, O
don't O
do O
n't O
sit O
there O
and O
argue O
with O
the O
customer H
. O

Say O
something O
like O
, O
" O
Huh O
. O

I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
think O
so O
but O
you H
could O
be O
right O
. O
" O

Unless O
you H
want O
to O
take O
the O
" O
tell O
the O
customer H
how O
wrong O
she O
is O
and O
try O
and O
force N
her O
into O
a O
dress O
she's O
she O
's H
obviously O
not O
loving O
" O
approach N
which O
will O
likely O
get O
you H
... O
uh O
... O
nowhere O
. O

Seriously O
: O
do O
not O
waste O
your H
time N
. O

Other O
shops N
around O
this O
city N
have O
MUCH O
NICER O
and O
more O
TRANSPARENT O
owners H
. O

Not O
owners H
that O
seem O
like O
they O
have O
something O
to O
hide N
and O
know O
nothing N
about O
common O
courtesy N
and O
customer H
service N
. O

I H
felt N
very O
much O
like O
Wedding O
Gallery O
was O
being O
dishonest O
and O
I H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
trust N
them O
to O
lace O
me H
up O
in O
another O
gown N
let O
alone O
trust N
them O
with O
the O
gown N
I H
will O
wear O
on O
the O
most O
important O
day N
of O
my H
life N
. O

AWFUL O
SERVICE N
! O

After O
happily O
visiting O
Sear's O
Automotives O
in O
the O
past N
, O
I H
was O
shocked O
at O
the O
horrible O
service N
received O
at O
their O
Greensboro O
location N
. O

I H
brought O
my H
car N
in O
on O
a O
Sunday O
to O
replace O
a O
shredded O
tire N
. O

I H
waited O
about O
20 O
minutes N
in O
the O
store N
part N
before O
anyone O
was O
able O
to O
assist O
me H
and O
was O
then O
told O
to O
pull O
my H
car N
into O
the O
shop N
( O
that O
is O
apparently O
what O
you H
are O
supposed O
to O
do O
, O
but O
the O
big O
signs N
pointing O
you H
that O
way N
are O
for O
some O
reason N
kept O
inside O
the O
garage N
, O
so O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
see O
them O
drving O
up O
, O
and O
they O
purposely O
block O
the O
front N
pull O
- O
up O
that O
all O
other O
Sear's O
use H
) O
. O

Once O
inside O
, O
I H
had O
to O
stand O
around O
for O
at O
least O
10 O
more O
minutes N
before O
-- O
FINALLY O
-- O
a O
technician H
got O
to O
me H
. O

Once O
I H
returned O
to O
pick O
up O
my H
car N
, O
you H
can O
believe O
I H
spent O
quite O
a O
bit N
MORE O
time N
standing N
around O
waiting O
. O

I H
had O
wanted O
to O
split O
the O
total N
between O
a O
credit N
card N
and O
check O
card N
since O
I H
was O
being O
reimbursed O
for O
the O
tire N
but O
was O
told O
this O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
possible O
. O

Once O
I H
actually O
got O
back O
in O
my H
car N
, O
it O
was O
dirty O
and O
had O
grease N
all O
over O
the O
steering N
wheel N
. O

OK O
, O
one N
bad O
experience N
... O
fine O
. O

The O
following O
Friday O
, O
I H
returned O
with O
my H
car N
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
replace O
the O
other O
3 O
tires N
, O
which O
were O
worn O
. O

I H
would O
not O
have O
gone O
back O
, O
but O
I H
couldn't O
could O
n't O
find O
the O
particular O
tire N
they'd O
they O
'd O
used O
in O
stock N
anywhere O
else O
. O

Once O
again O
, O
I H
waited O
for O
quite O
a O
bit N
before O
being O
attended O
to O
. O

I H
got O
the O
order O
completed O
, O
and O
then O
questioned O
the O
technician H
since O
it O
came O
out H
about O
$ O
40 O
less O
than O
I H
expected O
. O

He O
said O
it O
was O
the O
same O
tire N
, O
and O
verified O
this O
, O
after O
checking O
both O
the O
actual O
tire N
on O
my H
car N
and O
my H
service N
papers N
from O
earlier O
in O
the O
week N
. O

However O
, O
when O
he O
printed O
out H
the O
service N
quote N
, O
I H
could O
see O
that O
it O
was O
NOT O
the O
correct O
tire N
, O
and O
was O
not O
even O
an O
appropriate O
tire N
for O
my H
car N
model N
. O

So O
I H
pointed O
this O
out H
to O
him O
, O
at O
which O
point N
he O
said O
they O
only O
had O
one N
of O
the O
correct O
tires N
in O
stock N
. O

Ok O
-- O
fine O
. O

So O
I H
got O
just O
my H
other O
rear O
tire N
replaced O
. O

They O
promised O
it'd O
it O
'd O
be O
done O
within O
an O
hour N
, O
so O
I H
waited O
in O
the O
lobby N
. O

Over O
two O
hours N
later O
( O
and O
ten O
minutes N
before O
they O
closed O
) O
my H
car N
was O
finally O
finished O
. O

A H
few O
minutes N
after O
I H
left O
, O
I H
was O
called O
and O
informed O
that O
" O
I H
" O
left O
my H
wheel N
lock O
( O
which O
they O
should O
have O
left O
in O
the O
car N
) O
. O

Of O
course N
, O
they O
would O
be O
closing O
in O
5 O
minutes N
, O
so O
I H
would O
have O
to O
hurry N
up O
or O
get O
it O
the O
next O
day N
. O

Of O
course N
I H
couldn't O
could O
n't O
make O
it O
back O
in O
time N
( O
and O
they O
apparently O
could O
not O
stay O
5 O
extra O
minutes N
to O
wait N
for O
me H
) O
. O

The O
next O
day N
, O
no O
one N
could O
find O
my H
wheel N
lock O
and O
that O
particular O
technician H
was O
not O
in O
. O

Of O
course N
, O
they O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
call O
him O
either O
to O
ask O
about O
it O
because O
apparently O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
keep O
their O
employees' O
employees H
' O
phone N
numbers N
( O
riiight O
) O
, O
so O
I H
would O
have O
to O
return O
on O
Monday O
( O
driving O
for O
3 O
days N
now O
with O
no O
wheel N
lock O
should O
I H
get O
a O
flat O
) O
. O

On O
Monday O
I H
called O
and O
again O
it O
was O
a O
big O
to O
- O
do O
to O
find O
anyone O
who O
knew O
anything O
about O
it O
. O

Supposedly O
they O
will O
be O
holding O
it O
for O
me H
this O
evening N
, O
but O
I'm O
I H
'm O
sure O
that O
will O
also O
be O
a O
huge O
ordeal N
. O

The O
employees H
at O
this O
Sear's O
are O
completely O
apathetic O
and O
there O
didn't O
did O
n't O
seem O
to O
be O
any O
sort N
of O
management N
that O
I H
could O
see O
. O

I H
will O
never O
return O
there O
again O
( O
and O
now O
have O
some O
serious O
doubts N
about O
the O
quality N
of O
work N
they O
actually O
performed O
on O
my H
car N
) O

How O

The O
viewing O
experience N
of O
art N
is O
a O
complex O
one N
, O
involving O
issues N
of O
perception N
, O
attention N
, O
memory N
, O
decision N
- O
making O
, O
affect O
, O
and O
emotion N
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
time N
it O
takes O
and O
the O
ways N
of O
visually O
exploring O
an O
artwork N
can O
inform O
about O
its O
relevance N
, O
interestingness N
, O
and O
even O
its O
aesthetic O
appeal O
. O

This O
paper N
describes O
a O
collaborative O
pilot O
project N
focusing O
on O
a O
unique O
collection N
of O
17th O
Century N
Zurbarán O
paintings N
. O

The O
Jacob H
cycle N
at O
Auckland O

is O
the O
only O
UK O
example N
of O
a O
continental O
collection N
preserved O
in O
situ O
in O
purpose N
- O
built O
surroundings N
. O

While O
studies N
of O
the O
psychology N
of O
art N
have O
focused O
on O
individual O
works O
and O
distinctions N
between O
representative O
/ O
non-representative O

no O
work N
has O
been O

on O
the O

In O
this O
paper N
, O
we H
report N
upon O
the O
novel N
insights N
eye N

tracking O
techniques N
have O
provided O
into O
the O
unconscious O
processes N
of O
viewing O
the O
unique O
collection N
of O
Zurbarán O
artworks N
. O

The O
purpose N
of O
this O
pilot O
study O
was O
to O
assess O
the O
effects N
of O
different O
written O
interpretation N
on O
the O
visual O
exploration N
of O
artworks N
. O

We H
will O
discuss O
the O
potential N
implications N
of O
these O
techniques N
and O
our H
understanding N
of O
visual O
behaviours N
on O
museum N
and O

practice O
. O

The O
project N
brings O
together O
established O
research N
strengths N
in O
Spanish O
art N
history N
, O
experimental O
psychology N
, O
digital O
humanities N
, O
and O
museum N
studies N
to O
explore O
, O
using O
eye N
- O
tracking O
techniques N
, O
aesthetic O
reactions N
to O
digital O
representations N
of O
the O
individual O
Zurbarán O
artworks N
as O
well O
as O
the O
significance N
of O
the O
collection N
as O
a O
whole O
. O

Our H
experience N
of O
art N
develops O
from O
the O
interaction N
of O
several O
cognitive O
and O
affective O
processes N
; O
the O
beginning O
of O
which O
is O
a O
visual O
scan O
of O
the O
artwork N
. O

When O
regarding O
an O
artwork N
, O
a O
viewer H
gathers O
information N
through O
a O
series N
fixations N
, O
interspersed O
by O
rapid O
movements N
of O
the O
eye N
called O
saccades N
. O

The O
direction N
of O
saccades N
is O
determined O
by O
an O
interaction N
between O
the O
goals N
of O
the O
observer H
and O
the O
physical O
properties N
of O
the O
different O
elements N
of O
the O
scene N
( O
e.g. O
colour N
, O
texture N
, O
brightness N
etc O
) O
. O

Importantly O
, O
studying O
eye N
movements N
offers O
an O
insight N
that O
does O
not O
depend O
on O
the O
participants’ O
participants H
’ O
beliefs N
, O
memories N
or O
subjective O
impressions N
of O
the O
artwork N
. O

Previous O
eye N
tracking O
research N
has O
highlighted O
the O
potential N
to O
transform O
the O
ways N
we H
understand O
visual O

1 O
Introduction N

Tenured O
and O
tenure N
- O
track N
university N
faculty N
play O
a O
special O
role N
in O
determining O
the O
speed N
and O
direction N
of O
scientific O
progress N
, O
both O
directly O
through O
their O
research N
and O
indirectly O
through O
their O
training N
of O
new O
researchers H
. O

Past O
studies N
establish O
that O
each O
of O
these O
efforts N
is O
strongly O
and O
positively O
influenced O
through O
various O
forms N
of O
faculty N
diversity N
, O
including O
ethnic O
, O
racial O
, O
and O
gender N
diversity N
. O

As O
an O
example N
, O
research N
shows N
that O
greater O
diversity N
within O
a O
community N
or O
group N
can O
lead O
to O
improved O
critical O
thinking O
[ O
1 O
] O
and O
more O
creative O
solutions N
to O
complex O
tasks N
[ O
2 O
, O
3 O
] O
by O
pairing O
together O
individuals H
with O
unique O
skillsets O
and O
perspectives N
that O
complement O
and O
often O
augment O
the O
abilities N
of O
their O
peers H
. O

Additionally O
, O
diversity N
has O
been O
shown O
to O
produce O
more O
supportive O
social O
climates N
and O
effective O
learning O
environments N
[ O
4 O
] O
, O
which O
can O
facilitate O
the O
mentoring O
of O
young O
scientists H
. O

Despite O
these O
positive N
effects N
, O
however O
, O
quantifying O
the O
impact N
of O
diversity N
in O
science N
remains O
exceedingly O
difficult O
, O
due O
in O
large O
part N
to O
a O
lack N
of O
comprehensive O
data N
about O
the O
scientific O
workforce N
. O

Measuring O
the O
composition N
and O
dynamics N
of O
a O
scientific O
workforce N
, O
particularly O
in O
a O
rapidly O
expanding O
field N
like O
computer N
science N
, O
is O
a O
crucial O
first O
step O
toward O
understanding N
how O
scholarly O
research N
is O
conducted O
and O
how O
it O
might O
be O
enhanced O
. O

For O
many O
scientific O
fields N
, O
however O
, O
there O
is O
no O
central O
listing O
of O
all O
tenure N
- O
track N
faculty N
, O
making O
it O
difficult O
to O
define O
a O
rigorous O
sample N
frame O
for O
analysis N
. O

Further O
, O
rates N
of O
adoption N
of O
services N
like O
GoogleScholar O
and O
ResearchGate O
vary O
within O
, O
and O
across O
disciplines N
. O

For O
instance N
, O
gender N
representation N
in O
computing N
is O
an O
important O
issue N
with O
broad O
implications N
[ O
5 O
] O
, O
but O
without O
a O
full O
census N
of O
computing N
faculty N
, O
the O
degree N
of O
inequality N
and O
its O
possible O
sources N
are O
difficult O
to O
establish O
[ O
6 O
] O
. O

Some O
disciplines N
, O
like O
political O
science N
, O
are O
organized O
around O
a O
single O
professional O
society N
, O
whose O
membership N
roll O
approximates O
a O
full O
census N
[ O
7 O
] O
. O

Most O
fields N
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand N
, O
including O
computer N
science N
, O
lack N
a O
single O
all O
- O
encompassing O
organization N
and O
membership N
information N
is O
instead O
distributed O
across O
many O
disjoint O
lists O
, O
such O
as O
web N
- O
based O
faculty N
directories N
for O
individual O
departments N
. O

Because O
assembling O
such O
a O
full O
census N
is O
difficult O
, O
past N
studies N
have O
tended O
to O
avoid O
this O
task N
and O
have O
instead O
used O
samples N
of O
researchers H
[ O
8 O
– O
11 O
] O
, O
usually O
specific O
to O
a O
particular O
field N
[ O
12 O
– O
16 O
] O
, O
and O
often O
focused O
on O
the O
scientific O
elite O
[ O
17 O
, O
18 O
] O
. O

Although O
useful O
, O
such O
samples N
are O
not O
representative O
of O
the O
scientific O
workforce N
as O
a O
whole O
and O
thus O
have O
limited O
generalizability O
. O

One O
of O
the O
largest O
census N
efforts N
to O
date N
assembled O
, O
by O
hand N
, O
a O
nearly O
complete O
record N
of O
three O
academic O
fields N
: O
computer N
science N
, O
history N
, O
and O
business N
[ O
19 O
] O
. O

This O
data N
set O
has O
shed O
considerable O
light N
on O
dramatic O
inequalities N
in O
faculty N
training N
, O
placement N
, O
and O
scholarly O
productivity N
[ O
6 O
, O
19 O
, O
20 O
] O
. O

But O
, O
this O
data N
set O
is O
only O
a O
single O
snapshot N
of O
an O
evolving O
and O
expanding O
system N
and O
hence O
offers O
few O
insights N
into O
the O
changing O
composition N
and O
diversity N
trends N
within O
these O
academic O
fields N
. O

In O
some O
fields N
, O
yearly O
data N
on O
faculty N
numbers N
and O
composition N
are O
available O
in O
aggregate O
. O

In O
computer N
science N
, O
the O
Computing O
Research O
Association N
( O
CRA O
) O
documents N
trends N
in O
the O
employment N
of O
PhD N
recipients H
through O
the O
annual O
Taulbee O
survey N
of O
computing N
departments N
in O
North H
America O
( O
cra.org/resources/taulbee-survey O
) O
. O

Such O
surveys N
can O
provide O
valuable O
insight N
into O
trends N
and O
summary N
statistics N
on O
the O
scientific O
workforce N
but O
suffer O
from O
two O
key N
weaknesses N
. O

First O
, O
surveys N
are O
subject O
to O
variable O
response N
rates N
and O
the O
misinterpretation N
of O
questions N
or O
sample N
frames N
, O
which O
can O
inject O
bias N
into O
fine O
- O
grained O
analyses N
[ O
21 O
, O
22 O
] O
. O

Second O
, O
aggregate O
information N
provides O
only O
a O
high O
- O
level N
view N
of O
a O
field N
, O
which O
can O
make O
it O
difficult O
to O
investigate O
causality N
[ O
23 O
] O
. O

For O
example N
, O
differences N
in O
recruitment N
and O
retention N
strategies N
across O
departments N
will O
be O
washed O
out H
by O
averaging O
, O
thereby O
masking N
any O
insights N
into O
the O
efficacy N
of O
individual O
strategies N
and O
policies N
. O

Here O
, O
we H
present N
a O
novel N
system N
, O
based O
on O
a O
topical O
web N
crawler H
, O
that O
can O
quickly O
and O
automatically O
assemble O
a O
full O
census N
of O
an O
academic O
field N
using O
digital O
data N
available O
on O
the O
public O
World N
Wide O
Web N
. O

This O
system N
is O
efficient O
and O
accurate O
, O
and O
it O
can O
be O
adapted O
to O
any O
academic O
discipline O
and O
used O
for O
continuous O
collection N
. O

The O
system N
is O
capable O
of O
collecting O
census N
data N
for O
an O
entire O
academic O
field N
in O
just O
a O
few O
hours N
using O
off O
- O
the O
- O
shelf N
computing N
hardware N
, O
a O
vast O
improvement N
over O
the O
roughly O
1600 O
hours N
required O
to O
do O
this O
task N
by O
hand N
[ O
19 O
] O
. O

By O
assembling O
an O
accurate O
census N
of O
an O
entire O
field N
from O
online O
information N
alone O
, O
this O
system N
will O
facilitate O
new O
research N
on O
the O
composition N
of O
academic O
fields N
by O
providing O
access O
to O
complete O
faculty N
listings N
, O
without O
having O
to O
rely O
on O
surveys N
or O
professional O
societies N
. O

This O
system N
can O
also O
be O
used O
longitudinally O
to O
study O
how O
the O
workforce’s O
workforce N
’s H
composition N
changes N
over O
time N
, O
which O
is O
particularly O
valuable O
for O
evaluating O
the O
effectiveness N
of O
policies N
meant O
to O
broaden O
participation N
or O
improve O
retention N
of O
faculty N
. O

Finally O
, O
applied O
to O
many O
academic O
fields N
in O
parallel O
, O
the O
system N
can O
elucidate O
scientists’ O
scientists H
’ O
movement N
between O
different O
disciplines N
and O
relate O
those O
labor N
flows N
to O
scientific O
advances N
. O

In O
short O
, O
many O
important O
research N
questions N
will O
benefit N
from O
the O
availability N
of O
accurate O
and O
frequently O
- O
recollected O
census N
data N
. O

Our H
study O
is O
organized O
as O
follows O
. O

We H
begin O
by O
detailing O
the O
design N
and O
implementation N
of O
our H
web N
crawler H
framework N
. O

Next O
, O
we H
present N
the O
results N
of O
our H
work N
in O
two O
sections N
. O

The O
first O
demonstrates O
the O
validity N
and O
utility N
of O
the O
crawler H
by O
collecting O
census N
data N
for O
the O
field N
of O
computer N
science N
and O
comparing O
it O
to O
a O
hand N
- O
curated O
census N
, O
collected O
in O
2011 O
[ O
19 O
] O
. O

The O
second N
provides O
an O
example N
of O
the O
type N
of O
research N
enabled O
by O
our H
system N
and O
uses O
the O
2011 O
and O
2017 O
censuses N
to O
investigate O
the O
“ O
leaky O
pipeline N
” O
problem N
in O
faculty N
retention N

2. O
New H
Institutional O
Economics N
: O
Theoretical O
Foundations N
and O
Application O
to O
the O
Argentine O
Case O

2.1. O
New H
Institutional O
Economics N
, O
Property N
Rights N
, O
and O
Credibility N
of O
the O
State’s O
State N
’s H
Commitment N

Throughout O
the O
second N
half O
of O
the O
20th O
century N
, O
we H
have O
witnessed O
the O
return O
of O
institutions N
to O
economic O
analysis N
. O

The O
awarding N
of O
the O
Nobel O
Prize N
in O
Economics N
to O
its O
main O
representatives H
( O
Douglass O
North H
, O
Ronald H
Coase O
, O
Oliver H
Williamson H
, O
and O
Elinor O
Ostrom O
) O
has O
contributed O
to O
its O
greater O
recognition N
. O

The O
two O
main O
notions N
of O
this O
economic O
approach N
are O
the O
concepts N
of O
transaction N
costs O
and O
institutions N
, O
analyzed O
by O
Coase O
and O
North H
, O
respectively O
. O

Coase O
[ O
13 O
, O
14 O
] O
argues O
that O
economic O
transactions N
involve O
costs O
, O
and O
where O
these O
costs O
outweigh O
the O
gains N
, O
the O
exchange O
will O
not O
take O
place N
. O

For O
its O
part N
, O
North H
defined O
the O
institutions N
as O
the O
“ O
rules N
of O
the O
game N
” O
: O
they O
determine O
the O
structure N
of O
the O
economy N
, O
establish O
incentives N
for O
economic O
behavior N
, O
and O
affect O
social O
interaction N
[ O
12 O
] O
. O

Thus O
, O
institutions N
also O
determine O
the O
level N
of O
uncertainty N
to O
which O
individuals H
are O
subject O
, O
stimulating O
or O
discouraging O
transactions N
. O

A H
viable O
economy N
requires O
an O
institutional O
structure N
that O
reduces O
existing O
uncertainty N
and O
guarantees N
property N
rights N
. O

In O
other O
words N
, O
it O
is O
critical O
that O
economic O
agents H
believe O
that O
their O
property N
rights N
will O
not O
be O
taken O
away O
by O
other O
public O
or O
private O
actors H
[ O
15 O
] O
. O

Achieving O
these O
objectives N
requires O
the O
creation N
of O
inclusive O
institutions N
, O
which O
guarantee N
the O
right O
to O
private O
property N
, O
incorporate O
an O
impartial O
legal O
system N
, O
and O
promote O
a O
society N
based O
on O
equality N
of O
conditions N
[ O
16 O
] O
. O

Of O
course N
, O
the O
state N
takes O
a O
lead O
role N
in O
promoting O
this O
type N
of O
institution N
. O

The O
state N
must O
protect O
property N
rights N
, O
provide O
public O
services N
, O
and O
ensure O
a O
sound N
judiciary N
. O

It O
is O
responsible O
also O
for O
imposing O
order O
and O
promoting O
a O
climate N
of O
cooperation N
among O
agents H
, O
penalizing O
all O
violators H
of O
contracts N
[ O
17 O
] O
. O

The O
path N
to O
a O
prosperous O
society N
is O
not O
an O
easy O
one N
. O

It O
is O
society N
that O
establishes O
, O
through O
political O
processes N
, O
the O
type N
of O
economic O
institutions N
that O
are O
adopted O
. O

If O
there O
are O
disagreements N
about O
the O
policies N
to O
be O
implemented O
, O
then O
the O
group N
that O
wins O
the O
political O
game N
will O
make O
the O
final O
decision N
. O

On O
the O
one N
hand N
, O
a O
society N
that O
adopts O
policies N
promoting O
inclusive O
political O
institutions N
will O
develop O
pluralist O
and O
centralized O
institutions N
. O

Inclusive O
institutions N
guarantee N
the O
right O
to O
private O
property N
, O
to O
an O
impartial O
legal O
system N
and O
promote O
a O
society N
based O
on O
equal O
conditions N
. O

These O
institutions N
benefit N
not O
only O
the O
elites N
, O
but O
society N
as O
a O
whole O
. O

The O
consequences N
of O
implementing O
inclusive O
institutions N
are O
reflected O
in O
increased O
activity N
, O
productivity N
, O
and O
economic O
growth N
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand N
, O
if O
extractive O
political O
institutions N
are O
implemented O
, O
then O
power N
will O
be O
consolidated O
within O
a O
small O
number N
of O
groups N
. O

In O
governments N
with O
extractive O
policies N
, O
the O
group N
in O
power N
usually O
extracts O
resources N
from O
the O
rest N
of O
the O
population N
for O
its O
own O
enrichment N
and O
well O
- O
being O
. O

Another O
feature N
of O
this O
type N
of O
government N
is O
that O
powerful O
interest N
groups N
oppose O
increased O
pluralism N
because O
it O
typically O
results N
in O
the O
loss N
of O
their O
privileges N
. O

Those O
in O
power N
have O
little O
interest N
in O
their O
power N
devolving O
to O
a O
greater O
number N
of O
agents H
, O
as O
would O
occur O
under O
political O
institutions N
that O
were O
more O
pluralistic O
[ O
16 O
] O
. O

It O
follows O
that O
the O
role N
of O
the O
state N
is O
essential O
. O

The O
institutional O
structure N
of O
a O
state N
and O
its O
constitution N
are O
responsible O
for O
restricting O
predatory O
action N
— O
even O
by O
the O
state N
itself O
— O
and O
for O
creating O
rules N
that O
benefit N
the O
community N
[ O
18 O
] O
. O

Moreover O
, O
compliance N
mechanisms N
must O
reflect O
ex O
ante O
and O
ex O
post N
standards N
[ O
12 O
] O
. O

But O
what O
happens O
when O
property N
rights N
are O
not O
respected O
? O

What O
if O
it O
is O
the O
state N
itself O
that O
exhibits N
predatory O
behavior N
? O

All O
these O
questions N
have O
a O
place N
in O
this O
case N
analysis N
. O

The O
expropriation N
of O
YPF O
is O
a O
case N
in O
which O
the O
Argentine O
State N
presents O
predatory O
behavior N
, O
encouraged O
by O
an O
extractive O
institutional O
framework N
. O

If O
the O
decisions N
taken O
by O
the O
state N
are O
not O
based O
on O
the O
general O
interest N
and O
, O
in O
their O
execution N
, O
do O
not O
respect N
property N
rights N
, O
the O
number N
of O
transactions N
will O
be O
reduced O
, O
which O
will O
result N
in O
unfavorable O
economic O
performance N
. O

In O
a O
scenario N
with O
insecure O
property N
rights N
, O
asymmetric O
information N
, O
and O
a O
judicial O
system N
that O
acts N
as O
a O
lax O
enforcement N
mechanism N
, O
as O
discussed O
in O
the O
following O
sections N
, O
the O
FDI O
is O
difficult O
to O
attract O
. O

2.2. O
Institutional O
Structure N
of O
the O
Argentine O
State N

In O
order O
to O
understand O
policymaking O
and O
its O
effects N
, O
one N
must O
have O
adequate O
knowledge N
of O
the O
focal O
country’s O
country N
’s H
institutional O
framework N
. O

Most O
of O
Argentina’s O
Argentina O
’s H
governments N
have O
been O
of O
the O
predatory O
type N
. O

The O
country’s O
country N
’s H
unequal O
economic O
growth N
originated O
in O
the O
colonial O
era N
and O
reflects O
how O
the O
Spanish O
metropolis N
influenced O
the O
establishment N
of O
extractive O
institutions N
[ O
7 O
] O
. O

Argentine O
politics N
are O
therefore O
highly O
unstable O
. O

Achieving O
political O
order O
would O
require O
the O
government N
to O
limit O
its O
actions N
and O
guarantee N
the O
rights N
of O
citizens H
— O
neither O
of O
which O
has O
yet O
occurred O
in O
Argentina O
. O

Introduction N

Enjambment N
takes O
place N
when O
a O
syntactic O
unit N
is O
broken O
up O
across O
two O
lines N
of O
poetry N
( O
Domínguez O

) O
, O
giving O
rise N
to O
different O
stylistic O
effects N
( O
e.g. O
increased O
emphasis N
on O
elements N
of O
the O
broken O

, O
or O

, O
or O

double O

for O
the O

In O
Spanish O

the O
syntactic O

that O
automatically O

a O

What O
is O
the O
interest N
of O
such O
large O
- O
scale N
automatic O
analyses N
of O
enjambment N
? O

First O
, O
the O
literature N
shows N
a O
debate N
about O

Enjambment N
in O
Spanish O

Syntactic O

units N
often O
match O
in O

However O
, O
this O
trend N

In O

enjambment N
( O

is O
considered O
to O
take O

Epistemic O
pollution N

Agents H
can O
rationally O
choose O
between O
experts H
only O
if O
the O
criteria N
that O
distinguish O
genuine O
experts H
from O
charlatans H
are O
common O
sense N
or O
widely O
known O
: O

if O
agents H
are O
to O
satisfy O
the O
epistemic O
conditions N
on O
responsibility N
, O
they O
must O
know O
what O
kinds N
of O
knowledge N
they O
must O
utilize O
to O
guide N
their O
selection N
of O
sources N
( O
on O
pain N
of O
infinite O
regress N
) O
. O

In O
fact N
, O
many O
, O
if O
not O
all O
, O
the O
markers N
of O
expertise N
identified O
by O
philosophers H
enjoy O
widespread O
recognition N
. O

The O
fact N
that O
these O
criteria N
are O
widely O
known O
, O
however O
, O
offers O
an O
opportunity N
to O
those O
who O
would O
use H
them O
for O
deception N
, O
witting O
or O
unwitting O
. O

Since O
expertise N
must O
be O
assessed O
through O
indirect O
markers N
, O
to O
mimic O
the O
markers N
of O
expertise N
is O
to O
mimic O
expertise N
[ O
17 O
] O
. O

We H
live O
in O
an O
epistemic O
environment N
that O
is O
heavily O
and O
deliberately O
polluted O
by O
agents H
who O
use H
mimicry N
and O
other O
methods N
as O
a O
means N
of O
inflating O
their O
pretense N
to O
expertise N
. O

This O
fact N
, O
together O
with O
the O
fact N
that O
such O
deception N
is O
widely O
known O
to O
occur O
, O
reduces O
ordinary O
people’s O
people N
’s H
trust N
in O
expert H
authority N
and O
diminishes O
their O
capacity N
to O
distinguish O
reliable O
from O
unreliable O
sources N
. O

For O
instance N
, O
those O
with O
an O
interest N
in O
deceiving O
the O
general O
public O
may O
set O
up O
parallel O
institutions N
that O
ostensibly O
guarantee N
expertise N
, O
taking O
advantage N
of O
the O
ways N
in O
which O
these O
parallel O
institutions N
mimic O
legitimate O
institutions N
to O
ensure O
that O
people N
are O
taken O
in O
. O

There O
are O
some O
egregious O
examples N
of O
this O
practice O
in O
the O
field N
of O
health N
care N
. O

For O
example N
, O
a O
small O
number N
of O
doctors H
set O
up O
the O
American O
College N
of O
Pediatricians O
( O
ACPeds O
) O
to O
advocate O
socially O
conservative O
viewpoints N
related O
to O
child H
health N
care N
. O

Such O
an O
organization N
is O
surely O
permissible O
, O
but O
it O
has O
had O
the O
unfortunate O
( O
and O
likely O
intended O
) O
effect N
of O
muddying O
debates N
in O
the O
public O
forum N
by O
misleading O
people N
into O
thinking O
that O
the O
college N
speaks O
for O
the O
pediatric O
profession N
at O
large O
. O

Thus O
, O
when O
ACPeds O
issued O
a O
statement N
condemning O
gender N
reassignment N
surgery N
in O
2016 O
[ O
21 O
] O
, O
many O
people N
mistook O
the O
organization’s O
organization N
’s H
political O
beliefs N
for O
the O
consensus N
view N
among O
United O
States O
pediatricians H
— O
although O
the O
peak N
body N
for O
pediatric O
workers H
, O
the O
American O
Academy O
of O
Pediatrics O
, O
has O
a O
much O
more O
positive N
view N
of O
gender N
dysphoria N
[ O
22 O
] O
. O

Insofar O
as O
the O
larger O
organization N
, O
with O
a O
broader O
membership N
base N
, O
can O
be O
expected O
to O
reflect O
a O
wider O
range N
of O
expert H
opinions N
and O
a O
higher O
degree N
of O
expertise N
, O
it O
is O
reasonable O
to O
give O
its O
views N
greater O
weight N
than O
those O
of O
the O
smaller O
organization N
. O

When O
ACPeds O
allows O
or O
encourages O
the O
impression N
that O
it O
speaks O
for O
the O
profession N
, O
it O
introduces O
an O
epistemic O
pollutant N
. O

A H
yet O
more O
egregious O
example N
of O
such O
pollution N
involved O
collaborative O
efforts N
by O
pharmaceutical O
companies N
and O
the O
publishing O
giant A
Elsevier O
to O
produce O
publications N
mimicking O
peer H
- O
reviewed O
journals N
in O
the O
interest N
of O
promoting O
the O
companies’ O
companies N
’ O
commercial O
products N
[ O
23 O
] O
. O

The O
companies N
hoped O
to O
leverage N
the O
prestige N
of O
Elsevier O
with O
these O
fake O
journals N
to O
endow O
their O
promotional O
“ O
research N
” O
with O
an O
air N
of O
reliability N
. O

When O
the O
deceit N
was O
uncovered O
, O
however O
, O
the O
effect N
was O
just O
the O
opposite N
: O

the O
legitimacy N
of O
the O
published O
findings N
was O
not O
enhanced O
through O
their O
publication N
by O
Elsevier O
, O
but O
rather O
the O
legitimacy N
of O
Elsevier’s O
Elsevier O
’s H
publications N
— O
and O
, O
by O
extension N
, O
all O
academic O
journals N
— O
was O
diminished O
through O
their O
dissemination N
of O
deceptive O
and O
commercially O
interested O
research N
. O

More O
recently O
, O
institutions N
of O
academic O
expertise N
have O
been O
subject O
to O
a O
large O
and O
growing O
outbreak N
of O
so O
- O
called O
predatory O
journals N
— O
journals N
that O
will O
publish O
almost O
anything O
for O
a O
fee N
. O

Once O
again O
, O
this O
phenomenon N
has O
the O
effect N
of O
making O
peer H
- O
reviewed O
journals N
appear O
less O
legitimate O
. O

At O
times N
, O
even O
those O
who O
work N
in O
academia N
may O
be O
unsure O
of O
a O
particular O
journal’s O
journal N
’s H
legitimacy N
, O
and O
there O
are O
genuine O
borderline O
cases N
. O

For O
example N
, O
the O
Frontiers O
contingent N
of O
journals N
appears O
legitimate O
— O
at O
least O
to O
me H
— O
despite O
the O
fact N
that O
authors H
are O
expected O
to O
pay O
a O
publication N
fee N
. O
8 O

Yet O
some O
Frontiers O
journals N
appear O
to O
have O
engaged O
in O
bad O
behavior N
, O
whether O
for O
profit N
or O
for O
some O
other O
motive N
. O

Frontiers O
in O
Public O
Health N
controversially O
published O
articles N
linking O
vaccines N
and O
autism N
[ O
24 O
] O
and O
questioning O
the O
link N
between O
HIV O
and O
AIDS O
[ O
25 O
] O
. O

Whether O
due O
to O
this O
behavior N
or O
not O
, O
Jeffrey H
Beall O
decided O
to O
add O
the O
publisher N
to O
his O
influential O
( O
but O
now O
sadly O
unavailable O
) O
list N
of O
questionable O
journals N
[ O
26 O
] O
. O

The O
controversy N
surrounding O
Beall’s O
Beall O
’s H
decision N
indicates O
how O
difficult O
it O
is O
to O
make O
such O
judgments N
— O
even O
for O
professionals H
. O

If O
academics H
with O
expertise N
in O
relevant O
fields N
have O
difficulty N
assessing O
whether O
particular O
journals N
or O
particular O
publishers N
are O
legitimate O
, O
one N
cannot O
can O
not O
reasonably O
expect O
ordinary O
people N
to O
make O
such O
judgments N
. O

If O
their O
confidence N
in O
scientific O
findings N
is O
lowered O
across O
the O
board N
as O
the O
result N
of O
such O
epistemic O
pollution N
, O
one N
can O
hardly O
blame N
them O
. O

Since O
conflicts N
of O
interest N
are O
a O
reason N
to O
discount N
expertise N
, O
it O
is O
incumbent O
on O
me H
to O
note N
that O
I H
have O
published O
in O
Frontiers O
journals N
on O
several O
occasions N
. O

Epistemic O
pollution N
may O
stem O
not O
only O
from O
counterfeit N
institutions N
of O
knowledge N
production N
but O
also O
from O
bad O
behavior N
by O
legitimate O
institutions N
. O

For O
example N
, O
pollution N
may O
result N
from O
attempts N
to O
game N
the O
systems N
put O
in O
place N
to O
track N
expertise N
. O

Consider O
institutions N
with O
a O
credentialing O
function N
, O
such O
as O
universities N
, O
bar N
associations N
, O
or O
peer H
review N
bodies N
. O

These O
institutions N
do O
not O
exist O
solely O
to O
credential O
experts H
. O

They O
have O
other O
functions N
, O
and O
these O
functions N
may O
come O
into O
conflict N
, O
creating O
pressures N
to O
inflate O
credentials N
. O

For O
example N
, O
universities N
have O
a O
financial O
incentive N
to O
inflate O
the O
expertise N
of O
their O
academic O
staff N
, O
thereby O
increasing O
their O
rankings N
, O
bringing O
in O
grant N
money N
, O
and O
attracting O
students H
. O

Systems O
that O
assess O
expertise N
can O
be O
manipulated O
, O
and O
many O
cases N
of O
such O
manipulation N
exist O
— O
take O
the O
recent O
example N
by O
the O
University N
of O
Malaysia O
, O
which O
attempted O
to O
boost N
metrics N
by O
urging O
its O
faculty N
to O
cite O
one N
another O
[ O
28 O
] O
. O

For O
this O
reason N
, O
institutions N
may O
also O
be O
slow O
to O
investigate O
accusations N
of O
fraud N
, O
and O
they O
may O
try O
to O
keep O
their O
discoveries N
in O
- O
house N
to O
protect O
their O
reputations N

The O

The O

A H

The O

Introduction N

A H
fundamental O
tenet N
of O
linguistic O
science N
is O
that O
the O
sound N
of O
a O
word N
has O
a O
purely O
arbitrary O
connection N
to O
the O
word's O
word N
's H
meaning N
[ O
1 O
] O
, O
[ O
2 O
] O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
sound N
of O
the O
word N
dog A
in O
English O
is O
connected O
to O
the O
concept N
‘ O
dog A
’ O
by O
historical O
accident N
and O
not O
by O
any O
natural O
connection N
; O
roughly O
the O
same O
concept N
is O
just O
as O
well O
denoted O
in O
French O
by O
chien O
, O
denoted O
in O
German O
by O
hund O
, O
and O
denoted O
in O
Japanese O
by O
inu O
. O

But O
it O
is O
not O
that O
a O
word N
can O
have O
just O
any O
vocal O
sound N
. O

While O
the O
possibility N
space N
for O
sound N
systems N
of O
the O
world's O
world N
's H
language N
is O
enormous O
, O
any O
given O
language N
makes O
use H
of O
only O
a O
restricted O
portion N
of O
the O
possible O
sounds N
[ O
3 O
] O
, O
[ O
4 O
] O
. O

It O
follows O
from O
these O
two O
basic O
principles N
– O
the O
‘ O
arbitrariness N
of O
the O
sign N
’ O
, O
and O
the O
‘ O
selectiveness O
of O
particular O
sound N
systems N
’ O
– O
that O
the O
words N
that O
exist O
in O
the O
world's O
world N
's H
languages N
should O
sound N
quite O
different O
from O
each O
other O
, O
and O
that O
the O
likelihood N
that O
there O
are O
universal O
words N
is O
extremely O
small O
. O

But O
in O
this O
study O
we H
present N
a O
striking O
exception N
to O
this O
otherwise O
robust O
rule N
. O

From O
a O
systematic O
comparison N
of O
10 O
spoken O
languages N
from O
5 O
continents N
we H
find O
evidence N
suggesting O
that O
a O
word N
like O
‘ O
Huh O
? O
’ O
– O
used O
as O
a O
‘ O
repair N
initiator H
’ O
when O
, O
for O
example N
, O
one N
has O
not O
clearly O
heard O
what O
someone H
just O
said O
[ O
5 O
] O
, O
[ O
6 O
] O
– O
is O
a O
universal O
word N
. O

There O
are O
two O
distinct O
claims N
being O
made O
here O
: O
1. O
that O
Huh O
? O
is O
universal O
, O
and O
2. O
that O
Huh O
? O
is O
a O
word N
. O

In O
support N
of O
the O
first O
claim O
, O
we H
show O
that O
the O
similarities N
in O
form N
and O
function N
of O
an O
interjection N
with O
the O
specific O
function N
of O
repair N
initiation N
are O
very O
much O
greater O
across O
languages N
than O
chance N
coincidence N
would O
admit O
. O

In O
fact N
the O
variation N
in O
form N
in O
unrelated O
languages N
across O
the O
globe N
is O
about O
the O
same O
as O
the O
variation N
we H
find O
in O
the O
way N
any O
regular O
word N
( O
e.g. O
, O
dog A
) O
is O
pronounced O
across O
dialects N
of O
English O
. O

In O
support N
of O
the O
second N
claim O
, O
we H
show O
that O
Huh O
? O
meets O
the O
criteria N
of O
a O
word N
in O
the O
sense N
of O
being O
a O
conventional O
lexical O
sign N
which O
must O
be O
learnt O
. O

Thus O
, O
in O
contrast N
to O
what O
has O
been O
presumed O
for O
interjections N
in O
general O
[ O
7 O
] O
, O
[ O
8 O
] O
and O
for O
huh O
? O
in O
particular O
[ O
9 O
] O
, O
[ O
10 O
] O
, O
we H
find O
that O
this O
item N
is O
linguistic O
in O
nature N
rather O
than O
being O
a O
mere O
grunt N
or O
non-lexical O
sound N
. O

We H
show O
that O
the O
form N
is O
locally O
calibrated O
in O
ways N
that O
show O
it O
fitting O
within O
different O
language N
systems N
. O

Huh O
? O
may O
be O
a O
non-prototypical O
word N
, O
but O
it O
is O
a O
word N
. O

Finally O
, O
we H
address N
the O
question N
of O
why O
all O
languages N
should O
have O
such O
a O
word N
and O
why O
its O
form N
should O
be O
so O
similar O
across O
languages N
. O

We H
observe O
that O
this O
item N
fulfils O
a O
crucial O
need O
shared O
by O
all O
languages N
– O
the O
efficient O
signalling O
of O
problems N
of O
hearing O
and O
understanding N
– O
and O
we H
propose O
that O
its O
form N
is O
constrained O
by O
selective O
pressures N
in O
a O
conversational O
environment N
that O
is O
essentially O
the O
same O
in O
all O
languages N
. O

Consider O
a O
case N
from O
English O
[ O

] O
: O

After O
speaker N
G H
makes O
a O
statement N
, O
speaker N
E H
utters O
the O
interjection N
huh O
? O
. O

This O
is O
followed O
by O
a O
repetition N
of O
the O
original O
statement N
by O
G H
. O

The O
technical O
term N
for O
this O
type N
of O
sequence N
is O
“ O
open O
other O
- O
initiated O
repair N
” O
: O

repair N
is O
initiated O
not O
by O
the O
speaker N
of O
the O
first O
turn O
but O
by O
the O
other O
participant H
( O
“ O
other O
- O
initiated O
” O
) O
, O
and O
the O
repair N
initiator H
signals N
that O
there O
is O
a O
problem N
, O
but O
it O
leaves N
open O
what O
the O
problem N
is O
( O
“ O
open O
” O
) O
[ O
11 O
] O
. O

The O
actual O
repair N
operation N
in O
response N
to O
this O
interjection N
is O
usually O
simply O
repetition N
, O
sometimes O
with O
slight O
modification N
. O

in O

These O
examples N
show O
that O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
identify O
the O
same O
conversational O
structure N
in O
unrelated O
languages N
. O

Essentially O
, O
this O
method N
gives O
us H
a O
natural O
control N
over O
conversational O
data N
, O
making O
possible O
systematic O
comparison N
across O
languages N
[ O

, O

. O

Sequences N
of O
other O
- O
initiated O
repair N
have O
been O
identified O
in O
every O
spoken O
language N
investigated O
so O
far O
[ O
14 O
] O
, O
[ O
15 O
] O
, O
and O
as O
the O
examples N
show O
, O
the O
interjection N
in O
the O
pivotal O
turn O
can O
be O
remarkably O
similar O
. O

This O
leads O
to O
the O
question N
driving O
our H
study O
: O

is O
huh O
? O
in O
this O
context N
a O
universal O
word N
? O

By O
compiling O
data N
from O
published O
literature N
we H
found O
that O
in O
thirty O
- O
one N
languages N
around O
the O
world N
, O
the O
interjection N
for O
other O
- O
initiated O
repair N
appears O
to O
be O
strongly O
similar O
( O
Figure O
1 O
) O
. O

However O
, O
written O
sources N
are O
rarely O
explicit O
about O
the O
precise O
form N
, O
meaning N
, O
and O
use H
of O
interjections N
. O

The O
most O
reliable O
way N
to O
study O
a O
conversational O
interjection N
is O
by O
examining O
cases N
of O
actual O
use H
. O

Therefore O
we H
collected O
data N
from O
recordings N
of O
naturally O
occurring O
informal O
conversations N
in O
a O
sample N
of O
10 O
languages N
from O
5 O
continents N
, O
varying O
fundamentally O
in O
terms N
of O
phonology N
, O
word N
structure N
, O
and O
grammar N
( O
languages N
1 O
– O
10 O
in O
Figure O
1 O
) O
. O

For O
optimal O
comparability N
, O
we H
studied O
the O
exact O
same O
conversational O
environment N
across O
languages N
: O
that O
of O
other O
- O
initiated O
repair N
( O
OIR O
) O
, O
in O
which O
one N
participant H
produces O
a O
turn O
at O
talk O
, O
the O
other O
then O
signals N
some O
trouble N
with O
this O
turn O
, O
and O
finally O
the O
first O
produces O
a O
next O
turn O
which O
aims O
to O
solve O
the O
trouble N
, O
usually O
by O
means N
of O
repetition N
and O
/ O
or O
modification N
. O

In O
some O
languages N
the O
interjection N
, O
or O
an O
item N
similar O
to O
it O
, O
was O
also O
found O
in O
other O
sequential O
environments N
, O
for O
instance N
to O
mark N
surprise O
or O
to O
pursue O
a O
response N
. O

Such O
alternative O
( O
and O
probably O
derived O
) O
uses O
provide O
insight N
in O
possible O
paths N
of O
semantic O
change O
, O
but O
we H
exclude O
them O
here O
to O
make O
sure O
we H
are O
comparing O
like O
with O
like O
. O

4. O
Discussion N
. O

We H
hypothesized O
that O
the O
children H
, O
who O
were O
over O
the O
age N
of O
six O
at O
the O
time N
of O
collection N
, O
would O
have O
adult O
- O
like O
SI O
interpretations N
. O

We H
expected O
that O
the O
use H
of O
a O
training N
session N
and O
then O
the O
format N
of O
the O
question N
would O
guide N
participants H
towards O
evaluating O
pragmatic O
felicity N
over O
providing O
truth N
value N
judgments N
, O
and O
would O
result N
in O
adult O
- O
like O
interpretations N
. O

Further O
, O
we H
posited O
that O
if O
our H
initial O
hypothesis N
was O
not O
supported O
, O
and O
in O
fact N
there O
was O
some O
non O
- O
adult O
- O
like O
performance N
, O
that O
there O
would O
be O
significant O
variability N
among O
the O
conditions N
, O
with O
cardinal O
numbers N
having O
the O
highest O
performance N
and O
some O
the O
weakest O
. O

On O
the O
surface N
, O
it O
does O
seem O
as O
if O
there O
is O
variability N
and O
perhaps O
a O
larger O
sample N
size N
or O
more O
items N
could O
lead O
to O
a O
significant O
finding O
( O
see O
limitations N
below O
) O
, O
but O
at O
least O
for O
this O
study O
, O
the O
only O
significant O
finding O
was O
the O
difference N
between O
cardinal O
numbers N
and O
some O
. O

Significant O
differences N
were O
not O
observed O
between O
all O
and O
cardinal O
numbers N
or O
all O
and O
some O
. O

LIMITATIONS N
AND O
FUTURE O
DIRECTIONS N

This O
study O
is O
limited O
in O
its O
power N

generalizability O
. O

It O
serves O
as O
a O

of O
the O
work N
that O
needs N
to O
be O
completed O
for O
the O
cross-linguistic O
study O
of O

in O

and O
acquisition N
more O
generally O
. O

Bantu O

are O
not O
included O
in O

often O
enough O
despite O
the O
numerous O
languages N
in O
this O
linguistic O
grouping N
and O
the O

of O

using O
them O
. O

Future N
studies N
need O
to O
include O
more O

and O
more O

to O
increase O

Future N

Follow O

up O

are O

In O
a O
future N
study O
, O
it O
is O
also O
important O
to O
consider O
if O
additional O
training N
in O
the O
difference N
between O
reporting N
on O

would O
impact N

or O
if O
more O
naturalistic O

( O
e.g. O
, O
demonstrating O
actions N
using O
real O
objects N
instead O
of O
two O

dimensional O
depictions N
) O
would O
be O
beneficial O
. O

Previous O
studies N
in O
this O
region N
of O
sub-Saharan O
Africa O
have O
found O
evidence N
of O
cultural O
differences N
in O

( O
Hein O
, O
Reich H
, O
Marks H
, O
Thuma O
, O
& O
Grigorenko O
, O

) O
. O

The O
current O
study O
is O
too O
small O
to O
make O
strong O
conclusions N
with O
regard N
to O
cultural O
differences N
and O
experimental O
methods N
; O

however O
, O
in O
the O
study O
by O
Hein O
and O
colleagues H
it O
was O
found O
that O
children H
responded O
more O
or O
less O
frequently O
based O
on O
factors N
such O
as O
stimuli N
type N
. O

In O
the O
current O
study O
, O
the O
responses N
from O
two O
children H
were O
not O
included O
because O
they O
responded O
the O
same O
way N
to O
every O
item N
through O
the O
training N
and O
all O
test N
items N
. O

More O
specifically O
, O
they O
answered O
“ O
yes O
” O
that O
the O
puppet N
described O
the O
pictures N
well O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
these O
two O
children H
understood O
the O
task N
and O
really O
did O
believe O
that O
the O
puppet N
did O
not O
produce O
any O
poor O
descriptions N
, O
and O
in O
this O
regard N
, O
are O
not O
yet O
adult O
- O
like O
in O
their O
SI O
interpretations N
. O

This O
is O
unlikely O
as O
they O
said O
that O
even O
the O
first O
training N
item N
was O
said O
well O
. O

It O
is O
also O
possible O
though O
that O
these O
two O
children H
were O
attempting O
to O
please O
the O
data N
collectors N
, O
or O
be O
polite O
, O
and O
that O
“ O
yes O
” O
was O
in O
some O
ways N
a O
default N
answer N
to O
be O
provided O
when O
having O
to O
respond O
verbally O
in O
a O
test N
context N
. O

Additional O
training N
with O
the O
methodology N
could O
improve O
outcomes N
. O

The O
puppets N
used O
were O
picked O
specifically O
for O
this O
task N
with O
careful O
attention N
to O
their O
appearance N
. O

Upon O
arrival H
at O
the O
school N
, O
however O
, O
it O
became O
clear N
that O
the O
children H
were O
not O
accustomed O
to O
playing O
with O
puppets N
and O
that O
the O
data N
collection N
would O
be O
a O
novel N
experience N
for O
them O
. O

Further O
exploration N
with O
greater O
cardinal O
number N
ranges N
could O
also O
prove O
interesting O
. O

Numbers N
through O
five O
in O
the O
participating O
communities N
are O
most O
often O
expressed O
with O
native O
Chitonga O
words N
while O
numbers N
greater O
than O
five O
are O
typically O
indicated O
using O
English O
borrowings N
. O

The O
cardinal O
numbers N
included O
in O
this O
study O
were O
only O
one N
through O
five O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
additional O
item N
variability N
, O
but O
larger O
numbers N
should O
be O
included O
in O
future N
research N
. O

5. O
Conclusion N
. O

Albeit O
limited O
, O
these O
results N
provide O
valuable O
insight N
into O
SI O
interpretation N
by O
Chitonga O
- O
speaking O
children H
and O
demonstrate O
that O
pragmatic O
inference N
acquisition N
likely O
follows O
the O
order O
identified O
in O
previous O
research N
, O
but O
appears O
to O
be O
completed O
at O
a O
later O
age N
in O
this O
language N
. O

This O
interesting O
combination N
of O
findings N
– O
expected O
hierarchy N
of O
difficulty N
, O
but O
differing O
age N
of O
acquisition N
– O
is O
an O
important O
addition N
to O
our H

Based O
on O
the O
results N
of O
the O
2011 O
Household O

Survey O
( O

, O
electricity N
remains O
as O
the O
most O
common O
source N
of O
energy N
used O
by O
households N
particularly O
in O
the O
Philippines O
. O

About O
87 O
percent N
of O
21.0 O
million O

used O
electricity N
from O
March O
to O
August O
2011 O
. O

As O
of O

, O
the O
demand N
for O
electricity N
in O
the O
residential O
is O
leading N
among O
the O
different O
sectors N

It O
is O
often O

Now O
that O
the O

is O
in O
the O
age N
where O
lighting N
seems O
to O
be O
a O
daily O
necessity N
, O
typical O
homes N

, O
consume O
nearly O
27 O

. O

Lighting N
plays N
a O
large O
part N
on O
the O

it O

about O
18 O

One O
of O
the O
main O
factors N
in O
lighting N
energy N
consumption N
is O
the O
light N
bulb N
. O

The O
use H
of O
correct O
and O
appropriate O
type N
of O
light N
bulb N
improves O
the O
efficiency N
of O
energy N
usage N
. O

There O
are O
three O
general O
types N
of O
lighting N
that O
are O
widely O
used O
in O
the O
household N
nowadays O
: O
the O
( O
light N
- O
emitting O
diode N
) O
LED N
bulb N
, O
( O
compact O
fluorescent O
light N
) O
CFL O
bulb N
and O
the O
incandescent O
bulb N
. O

But O
each O
of O
them O
has O
their O
perks N
and O
perils N
[ O
3 O
] O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
most O
of O
the O
time N
, O
people N
in O
the O
residential O
end N
up O
choosing O
a O
lamp N
based O
on O
it O
is O
price N
rather O
than O
its O
efficiency N
and O
this O
cause N
us H
to O
pay O
for O
our H
lighting N
more O
than O
necessary O
. O

Today N
, O
CFLs O
are O
the O
most O
used O
lighting N
sources N
in O
the O
household N
. O

Using O
CFLs O
will O
allow O
people N
to O
decrease O
their O
energy N
consumption N
; O
also O
it O
is O
a O
good O
start O
to O
decrease O
greenhouse N
emissions N
. O

However O
, O
the O
main O
problem N
of O
CFLs O
is O
the O
mercury N
they O
contain O
. O

When O
products N
and O
wastes N
containing O
mercury N
are O
improperly O
disposed O
of O
, O
mercury N
is O
released O
into O
the O
air N
, O
ground N
or O
water N
. O

It O
is O
persistent O
in O
the O
environment N
; O
it O
never O
breaks O
down O
nor O
goes O
away O
. O

In O
addition N
to O
the O
harmful O
effects N
of O
mercury N
is O
that O
it O
emits O
Ultraviolet O
( O
UV O
) O
Radiation N
. O

This O
UV O
radiation N
interacts O
with O
the O
chemicals N
on O
the O
inside O
of O
the O
bulb N
to O
generate O
light N
. O

The O
acute O
and O
chronic O
effects N
are O
the O
normal O
responses N
of O
the O
skin N
to O
UVR O
; O
acute O
reactions N
considered O
will O
be O
erythema N
( O
sunburn N
) O
and O
vitamin N
D H
production N
. O

Skin N
aging N
and O
skin N
cancer N
will O
be O
discussed O
as O
those O
reactions N
produced O
by O
prolonged O
or O
repeated O
UVR O
exposure N
[ O

. O

In O
response N
to O
the O
aforementioned O
situation N
where O
the O
three O
types N
of O
lights N
are O
compared O
by O
their O
efficiency N
and O
effectiveness N
as O
light N
sources N
, O
the O
proponents H
conducted O
this O
study O
. O

Since O
the O
CFLs O
are O
the O
most O
commonly O
used O
light N
bulbs N
in O
the O
residential O
and O
has O
a O
great O

1. O
Introduction N

Mutation O
- O
based O
testing O
[ O
1 O
] O
is O
a O
test N
technique N
that O
involves O
artificially O
introducing O
errors N
into O
a O
System O
Under O
Test O
( O
SUT O
) O
. O

A H
mutant O
is O
a O
copy N
of O
the O
system N
in O
which O
a O
change O
has O
been O
done O
that O
, O
in O
most O
cases N
, O
will O
lead O
to O
a O
behaviour N
different O
than O
expected O
. O

The O
different O
mutants A
are O
generated O
automatically O
by O
the O
application N
of O
mutation N
operators H
. O

In O
the O
state N
of O
the O
art N
, O
we H
have O
found O
mutation N
operators H
, O
both O
general O
purpose N
and O
specific O
to O
different O
technologies N
, O
languages N
and O
paradigms N
[ O
2 O
– O
9 O
] O
. O

However O
, O
these O
operators H
are O
not O
adequate O
when O
trying O
to O
test N
software N
features O
associated O
with O
specific O
domains N
. O

In O
this O
article N
, O
we H
propose O
mutation N
operators H
specific O
to O
the O
domain N
of O
Geographic O
Information O
Systems O
( O
GIS N
) O
applications N
. O

These O
operators H
reproduce O
programming N
errors N
that O
are O
litely O
to O
occur O
during O
the O
development N
of O
this O
type N
of O
applications N
. O

In O
addition N
, O
we H
present N
the O
implementation N
of O
these O
operators H
and O
as O
proof N
of O
concept N
we H
apply O
these O
operators H
to O
two O
real O
- O
world N
GIS N
applications N
and O
we H
generate O
the O
mutants A
. O

2. O
Mutation O
Operators O
for O
GIS N

As O
a O
previous O
step O
to O
designing O
the O
mutation N
operators H
, O
we H
analyzed O
the O
main O
technologies N
used O
specifically O
in O
the O
development N
of O
GIS N
, O
and O
we H
identified O
typical O
errors N
a O
programmer H
can O
introduce O
during O
the O
development N
. O

These O
errors N
were O
formalized O
into O
mutation N
operators H
. O

In O
order O
to O
apply O
these O
operators H
to O
a O
SUT O
, O
we H
rely O
on O
Java O
reflection N
and O
aspect N
- O
oriented O
programming N
. O

Reflection N
allows O
us H
to O
obtain O
the O
list N
of O
classes N
and O
methods N
of O
the O
SUT O
, O
so O
the O
user H
can O
decide O
the O
methods N
to O
wish O
the O
operators H
will O
be O
applied O
. O

Later O
, O
we H
capture O
information N
about O
the O
methods N
of O
the O
SUT O
to O
be O
mutated O
, O
together O
with O
the O
information N
of O
the O
mutation N
operators H
that O
were O
already O
defined O
. O

From O
these O
data N
, O
we H
generate O
the O
mutation N
operator N
, O
in O
the O
form N
of O
on O
aspect N
, O
which O
will O
then O
be O
possible O
to O
interweave O
with O
the O
SUT O
which O
generates O
a O
mutant O
of O
the O
SUT O
. O

Next O
, O
we H
describe O
the O
definition N
of O
two O
operators H
and O
two O
cases N
of O
application N
on O
real O
- O
world N
GIS N
applications N
. O

ChangeCoordSys O
Operator O
( O
Listing O

) O
: O

It O
exchanges N
the O
coordinate O
system N
of O
a O
geometry N
, O
so O
it O
does O
not O
match O
the O
coordinate O
system N
that O
is O
being O
used O
in O
the O
user H
interface N
. O

It O
simulates O
the O
error N
of O
not O
checking O
that O
the O
coordinate O
system N
is O
correct O
. O

The O
error N
is O
introduced O
by O
directly O
modifying O
the O
coordinate O
system N
of O
geometry N
when O
recovering O
the O
wrapping N
of O
the O
figure O
. O

Listing O

: O
A H
simplified O
definition N
of O
the O
ChangeCoordSys O
Operator O
. O

This O
operator N
was O
applied O
to O
a O
mobile O
technology N
GIS N
application N
. O

This O
application N
allows O
registering O
places N
of O
interest N
for O
the O
user H
. O

These O
areas N
of O
interest N
are O
called O
Geofences O
. O

A H
Geofence O
is O
determined O
by O
a O
geographical O
location N
expressed O
in O
terms N
of O
latitude N
, O
longitude N
, O
and O
a O
radius N
around O
that O
location N
. O

By O
creating O
a O
Geofence O
with O
an O
erroneous O
location N
from O
its O
central O
location N
, O
the O
device N
will O
receive O
incorrect O

Conclusions N

In O
existing O
proposals N
, O
we H
can O
find O
both O
generic O
and O
specific O
mutation N
operators H
. O

However O
, O
these O
are O
not O
adequate O
to O
cover O
errors N
in O
particular O
domains N
. O

We H
have O
defined O
new O
operators H
specific O
to O
the O
GIS N
domain N
and O
a O
way N
to O
apply O
them O
to O
a O
SUT O
. O

In O
addition N
, O
we H
have O
tested O
the O
operators H
defined O
in O
two O
GIS N
applications N
. O

As O
future N
work N
, O
we H
intend O
to O
extend O
this O
approach N
to O
other O
domains N
, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
use H
the O
developed O

Replication N

The O
driving O
force N
behind O
this O
battery N

calls O
, O

, O

and O
metascience O
is O
a O
perceived O
crisis N
in O
the O
state N
of O
replication N
research N
. O

The O
severe O
concerns O
underpinning O
the O
alleged O
crisis N
have O
several O
dimensions N
relating O
to O
: O
(a) O
the O
( O
small O
) O
amount N
of O
published O
replication N
research N
; O
(b) O
the O
( O

) O
quality N
of O

; O
and O
(c) O
the O
( O
lack N
of O
) O
reproducibility N
, O
which O
refers O
to O
the O
extent N
to O
which O
findings N
can O
( O
not O
) O
be O
reproduced O
in O
replication N
attempts N
that O
have O
been O
undertaken O
. O

These O
concerns O
speak O
to O
the O
very O
core N
of O
science N
, O
raising O
fundamental O
questions N
about O
the O
validity N
and O
reliability N
of O
our H
work N
. O

Indeed O
, O
some O
commentators H
have O
called O
replication N
the O
“ O
gold N
standard O
” O
of O
research N
evidence N
( O

In O
the O
field N
of O
L2 O
research N
, O
given O
the O
importance N
of O
replication N
and O
the O
50 O
calls O
for O
replication N
in O
L2 O

that O
we H
identified O
, O
one N
might O
expect O
a O
substantial O
number N

by O

. O

However O
, O
a O
perceived O
lack N
of O
prestige N

, O
and O
originality N
of O
replication N
plagues N
L2 O
research N
( O

and O
these O

has O
not O
yet O
been O
established O
in O
the O

poor O
understanding N
of O
the O
actual O

and O

that O

. O

The O
current O
study O
begins O
to O
address N
this O
gap N
through O
narrative N
and O
systematic O
reviews N
. O

The O
narrative N
review N
considers O
challenges N
in O
replication N
research N
and O
is O
largely O
informed O
by O
commentaries N
and O
metascience O
from O

, O
given O
that O
the O
cognitive O

subdomains O

highly O
influential O
in O
L2 O
research N
, O
and O
also O
from O

, O
another O
key N
sister H
discipline O
. O

The O
narrative N
review N
is O
organized O
around O
four O
broad O
themes N
: O
(a) O
the O
quantity N

(b) O
the O
nature N

, O
(c) O
the O

and O
(d) O
the O
interpretation N
and O
extent N
of O

of O
the O

To O
gain O
insight N
into O
these O
issues N
in O
the O
context N

the O

a O

The O
research N
questions N
and O
methods N
of O
the O
systematic O

were O
largely O
determined O
by O
the O
narrative N

but O
also O
emerged O
through O
the O
design N
and O
piloting N
of O

Finally O
, O
we H
offer O
further O
discussion N

16 O
recommendations N
for O

that O
draw O
on O

We H

from O

have O
an O
essential O

in O
the O

and O
refinement N
of O

, O
at O

for O
hypothesis N
- O
testing O
epistemologies N
that O
seek O
to O

and O
for O
other O

to O
be O

Thus O
, O
our H

to O
provide O
conceptual O

and O
an O
empirical O
base N
for O

Introduction N

Salinity N
is O
one N
of O
the O
most O
important O
marine O
parameters N

which O
controls N

as O

have O
accumulated O
large O
amount N

, O
it O
is O
still O

and O
a O
significant O
improvement N
has O
been O
made O
to O
understand O
the O
ocean N
dynamics N
and O
climate N
change O
. O

The O
early O
concept N
of O
remote O
sensing N
of O
SSS N
has O
been O
demonstrated O
in O
the O
late O
1970s N
with O
observations N
by O

] O
and O
two O
airborne O
L H

experiments N
[ O

] O
. O

At O
the O
end N
of O
1990 O
, O
two O
airborne O
microwave N
interferometers N
, O
the O
electronically O
scanned O

( O
ESTAR O

and O

( O

) O
, O
successfully O
produced O
SSS N
maps N
in O
coastal O
areas N
in O
agreement N
with O
in O
- O
situ O
measurements N
with O
an O
accuracy N
of O
about O
1 O
psu O
. O

Based O
on O
many O
experiments N
, O
the O
L H
- O
band N
is O
evidenced O
as O
the O
optimal O
frequency N
for O
remote O
sensing N
of O
SSS N
, O
which O
has O
been O
adopted O
by O
SMOS O
, O
Aquarius O
/ O
SAC-D O
and O
SMAP O
. O

However O
, O
the O
sensitivity N
of O
satellite N
measured O
brightness N
temperature N
to O
SSS N
is O
quite O
low O
. O

For O
example N
, O
the O
sensitivity N
of O
vertically O
polarized O
brightness N
temperature N
to O
SSS N
variation N
is O
0.4 O
to O
0.8 O
K/psu O
for O
different O
observing O
angles N
and O
sea N
surface N
temperatures N
( O
SST O
) O
, O
and O
it O
is O
only O
0.2 O
to O
0.6 O
K/psu O
for O
the O
horizontal O
polarization N
brightness N
temperature N
[ O
10 O
] O
. O

Thus O
, O
remote O
sensing N
of O
SSS N
requires O
a O
highly O
accurate O
retrieval N
model N
. O

It O
is O
widely O
accepted O
that O
the O
corrections N
of O
the O
sea N
surface N
and O
atmospheric O
effects N
are O
essential O
for O
remote O
sensing N
of O
SSS N
, O
since O
these O
effects N
could O
alter O
the O
value N
of O
sensor N
- O
measured O
brightness N
temperature N
and O
introduce O
errors N
into O
the O
SSS N
retrieval N
process N
. O

Besides O
the O
atmospheric O
effects N
, O
the O
increasing O
of O
sea N
surface N
emissivity O
due O
to O
the O
sea N
surface N
roughness N
and O
foam N
effects N
is O
the O
main O
source N
of O
error N
, O
which O
could O
significantly O
hamper O
the O
accuracy N
of O
SSS N
retrieval N
[ O

] O
. O

Over O
the O
past N
decades N
, O
the O
correction N
for O
sea N
surface N

were O
studied O
based O
on O

corrected O
by O
numerous O
models N

the O
semi-empirical O
models N

which O
were O
developed O

the O

Although O
many O
theoretical O
and O
empirical O
models N
have O
been O
developed O
, O
some O
problems N
are O
still O
unsolved O
. O

For O
example N
, O
the O
TSM O
originally O
proposed O
to O
estimate N
brightness N
temperature N
at O
higher O
frequencies N
, O
uses O
the O
sea N
surface N
wave N
spectrum N
by O
multiplying O
a O
factor N
of O
2 O
. O

However O
, O
whether O
this O
modification N
can O
be O
applied O
to O
L H
- O
band N
is O
still O
unclear O
, O
and O
the O
choice N
of O
cutoff N
wavenumber O
is O
arbitrary O
and O
needs N
to O
be O
clarified O
in O
the O
L H
- O
band N
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
sea N
surface N
reflection N
of O
downwelling O
atmospheric O
emission N
is O
another O
contribution N
to O
satellite N
- O
observed O
brightness N
temperature N
[ O
31 O
] O
, O
thus O
the O
determination N
of O
the O
cutoff N
wavenumber O
is O
required O
not O
only O
for O
sea N
surface N
emission N
but O
also O
for O
reflection N
. O

In O
addition N
, O
the O
widely O
used O
empirical O
models N
decouple O
the O
wind N
effect N
from O
SSS N
and O
SST O
effects N
, O
which O
means N
that O
the O
surface N
emission N
is O
due O
to O
a O
perfectly O
flat O
sea N
surface N
and O
the O
wind N
- O
roughened O
sea N
surface N
. O

The O
wind N
- O
roughened O
sea N
surface N
is O
associated O
with O
the O
increased O
brightness N
temperature N
( O
due O
to O
sea N
surface N
roughness N
effect N
) O
, O
which O
induces O
regional O
biases N
when O
applied O
to O
different O
areas N
[ O
32 O
] O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
satellite N
measurements N
of O
SSS N
are O
hampered O
by O
the O
effect N
of O
radio N
frequency N
interference N
( O
RFI O
) O
in O
offshore O
areas N
of O
China O
( O
i.e. O
, O
Bohai O
sea N
, O
Yellow O
sea N
and O
East O
China O

) O
, O
which O
causes N
a O
large O
amount N
of O
data N
to O
be O
discarded O
[ O
33 O
] O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
compatibility N
of O
these O
models N
in O
coastal O

needs N
to O
be O
assessed O

Discussion N

We H
have O
shown O
that O
the O
addition N
of O
an O
artificial O
tail N
during O
ontogeny N
can O
produce O
postural O
and O
locomotory O
changes N
in O
chickens N
, O
consistent O
with O
the O
posture N
and O
kinematics N
inferred O
for O
non-avian O
dinosaurs A
[ O
5 O
] O
, O
[ O
6 O
] O
, O
[ O
11 O
] O
. O

The O
posterior O
displacement N
of O
the O
CoM O
produced O
a O
more O
vertically O
oriented O
femur N
during O
standing N
( O
femur N
in O
experimental O
animals A
was O
40 O
% O
more O
vertical O
than O
control N
subjects N
) O
, O
and O
increased O
femoral O
retraction N
and O
decreased O
knee N
flexion N
during O
walking O
. O

These O
results N
indicate O
a O
shift N
from O
the O
standard O
bird A
, O
knee N
- O
driven O
bipedal O
locomotion N
to O
a O
more O
hip N
- O
driven O
locomotion N
, O
typical O
of O
crocodilians A
( O
the O
only O
other O
extant O
archosaur A
group N
) O
, O
mammals A
, O
and O
hypothetically O
, O
bipedal O
non-avian O
dinosaurs A
. O

These O
postural O
and O
kinematics N
changes N
cannot O
can O
not O
be O
attributed O
to O
an O
increased O
weight N
as O
subjects N
of O
the O
control N
- O
weight N
group N
did O
not O
show O
the O
same O
changes N
as O
the O
experimental O
group N
. O

In O
fact N
, O
the O
control N
- O
weight N
subjects N
showed O
a O
more O
horizontally O
oriented O
femur N
during O
walking O
with O
respect N
to O
the O
control N
group N
, O
similar O
to O
that O
observed O
in O
Carrano O
and O
Biewener's O
Biewener O
's H
experimental O
subjects N
[ O
7 O
] O
. O

Therefore O
, O
we H
conclude O
that O
the O
location N
of O
the O
CoM O
can O
be O
a O
key N
factor N
in O
defining O
limb N
posture N
and O
kinematics N
. O

It O
has O
been O
proposed O
that O
the O
relative O
mass O
of O
the O
CFL O
can O
be O
used O
as O
a O
proxy H
to O
estimate N
the O
relative O
importance N
of O
femoral O
retraction N
during O
locomotion N
in O
extinct O
bipedal O
dinosaurs A
[ O
8 O
] O
. O

Our H
data N
show O
that O
for O
a O
given O
CFL O
mass O
, O
femoral O
retraction N
can O
be O
greatly O
affected O
by O
the O
location N
of O
the O
CoM O
and O
limb N
postures N
. O

Furthermore O
, O
limb N
retraction N
can O
be O
markedly O
modulated O
with O
speed N
[ O

, O
suggesting O
caution N
when O
using O
simple O
morphological O
parameters N
to O
estimate N
functional O
relationships N
. O

Differences N
in O
limb N
orientation N
can O
produce O
substantial O
differences N
in O

limb N

. O

The O
orientation N
of O
each O
limb N
element N
to O
the O
ground N
reaction N
force N
( O
GRF O
) O
indicates O
the O
relative O
contribution N

axial O
and O

to O
external O

: O
a O

the O

greater O

than O
one N

to O
the O

Because O

to O
its O

environment N
[ O

, O
[ O

, O
[ O

, O
geometric O
information N
from O
limb N

, O
such O
as O
lengths N
and O
cross-sectional O
geometry N
, O
are O
expected O
to O
reflect O
differences N
in O

and O
consequently O
in O
behavior N
and O
locomotor O
patterns N
[ O
22 O
] O
, O
[ O

] O
. O

In O
this O
framework N
, O
scaling N
differences N
in O
femoral O
geometry N
between O
non-avian O
theropods A
and O
birds A
have O
been O
suggested O
to O
be O
the O
result N
of O
postural O
differences N
between O
these O
groups N
[ O
6 O
] O
, O
[ O
23 O
] O
. O

Birds A
have O
relatively O
shorter O
, O
stouter O
femora N
than O
non-avian O
theropods A
, O
presumed O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
more O
horizontal O
orientation N
. O

Experimental O
manipulations N
of O
femoral O
orientation N
in O
chickens N
suggest O
that O
torsional O
loads N
increase O
as O
the O
femur N
becomes O
more O
horizontal O
[ O
7 O
] O
supporting O
the O
idea N
that O
postural O
differences N
could O
be O
reflected O
in O
differences N
in O
limb N
cross-sectional O
geometry N
. O

To O
test N
if O
the O
postural O
differences N
observed O
in O
this O
study O
produced O
changes N
in O
limb N
morphology N
, O
we H
measured O
the O
length N
and O
mid-shaft O
cross-sectional O
properties N
of O
the O
femur N
in O
all O
our H
individuals H
. O

However O
, O
we H
found O
no O
differences N
in O
cross-sectional O
femoral O
geometry N
among O
groups N
. O

Maybe O
this O
is O
not O
surprising O
considering O
that O
a O
recent O
study O
analyzing O
the O
relationship N
between O
posture N
and O
femur N
cross-sectional O
properties N
failed O
to O
find O
differences N
between O
birds A
and O
non-avian O
theropods A
[ O
24 O
] O
, O
suggesting O
that O
simple O
morphological O
correlates N
of O
limb N
posture N
should O
be O
used O
with O
caution N
. O

Interestingly O
, O
femur N
length N
tended O
to O
be O
greater O
in O
the O
experimental O
group N
than O
in O
both O
the O
control N
- O
weight N
and O
the O
control N
group N
( O
by O
4 O
and O
7 O
% O
, O
respectively O
) O
, O
although O
not O
signifcant O
. O

Longer O
limbs N
are O
expected O
to O
experience N
larger O
bending N
and O
torsional O
moments N
, O
so O
the O
fact N
that O
experimental O
animals A
had O
longer O
femora N
suggests O
that O
limb N
verticalization O
reduces O
these O
moments N
by O
orienting O
the O
bone N
more O
parallel O
to O
the O
GRF O
line N
of O
action N
. O

If O
this O
were O
the O
case N
, O
it O
would O
support N
the O
idea N
that O
non-avian O
theropods A
have O
relatively O
thinner O
femora N
than O
extant O
birds A
because O
of O
postural O
differences N
[ O

. O

The O
present N
study O
was O
inspired O
by O
Carrano O
& O
Biewener O
[ O
7 O
] O
but O
our H
results N
differed O
markedly O
from O
theirs O
. O

We H
suggest O
that O
the O
different O
outcomes N
are O
due O
to O
the O
distinct O
rearing N
and O
exercising N
conditions N
used O
in O
each O
study O
, O
in O
addition N
to O
the O
different O
artificial O
tails N
used O
. O

First O
, O
our H
experimental O
subjects N
lived O
in O
a O
large O
enclosure N
under O
conditions N
that O
allowed O
them O
to O
exercise N
all O
day N
long O
. O

In O
Carrano O
& O
Biewener's O
Biewener O
's H
study O
, O
experimental O
chickens N
were O
housed O
individually O
in O
smaller O
cages N
and O
were O
only O
allowed O
to O
exercise N
20 O
minutes N
per O
day N
, O
3 O
days N
per O
week N
, O
from O
the O
6th O
to O
the O
12th O
week N
. O

Second O
, O
in O
their O
study O
, O
a O
lead O
mass O
was O
attached O
at O
the O
distal O
end N
of O
the O
experimental O
tail N
, O
probably O
generating O
excessive O
displacement N
of O
the O
CoM O
. O

During O
avian O
evolution N
, O
the O
loss N
of O
the O
CFL O
and O
reorganization N
of O
the O
pelvic O
musculature N
[ O
5 O
] O
, O
[ O
13 O
] O
could O
have O
made O
birds A
unable O
to O
properly O
carry O
a O
postacetabular O
mass O
equivalent N
to O
that O
carried O
by O
non-avian O
theropods A
[ O
5 O
] O
, O
[ O
6 O
] O
. O

In O
our H
experimental O
setup N
, O
we H
attempted O
to O
more O
closely O
mimic O
non-avian O
theropod A
tail N
morphology N
, O
in O
which O
mass O
is O
distributed O
through O
a O
distally O
tapering N
tail N
. O

In O
addition N
, O
we H
reduced O
the O
total N
tail N
mass O
to O
15 O
% O
body N
mass O
from O
the O
20 O
% O
body N
mass O
used O
by O
Carrano O
and O
Biewener O
. O

Thus O
, O
our H
study O
seems O
to O
have O
generated O
a O
more O
gradual O
and O
less O
pronounced O
change O
in O
the O
moment N
of O
inertia N
produced O
by O
the O
artificial O
tail N
, O
allowing O
experimental O
subjects N
to O
adjust O
to O
the O
posterior O
mass O
by O
adopting O
a O
more O
vertical O
position N
of O
the O
femur N
while O
standing N
. O

Interestingly O
, O
the O
femur N
kinematics N
during O
walking O
in O
our H
control N
- O
weight N
group N
resembles O
the O
results N
reported O
in O
the O
experimental O
subjects N
of O
Carrano O
and O
Biewener O
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
their O
results N
could O
be O
partially O
explained O
as O
a O
response N
to O
the O
increased O
loading O
rather O
than O
to O
the O
displacement N
of O
the O
CoM O
. O

Due O
to O
the O
phylogenetic O
relatedness N
, O
extant O
birds A
have O
been O
used O
to O
inform O
functional O
aspects N
of O
non-avian O
dinosaur A
locomotion N
. O

However O
, O
substantial O
differences N
in O
hindlimb N
morphology N
between O
these O
groups N
make O
difficult O
to O
assess O
the O
validity N
of O
inferences N
obtained O
from O
such O
studies N
. O

It O
has O
even O
been O
proposed O
that O
, O
due O
to O
functional O
convergence N
, O
mammals A
might O
be O
a O
better O
system N
to O
study O
bipedal O
dinosaur A
locomotion N
[ O
7 O
] O
, O
[ O
23 O
] O
, O
but O
the O
results N
reported O
here O
show O
that O
important O
aspects N
of O
non-avian O
theropod A
locomotion N
can O
be O
experimentally O
recreated O
in O
modern O
birds A
. O

One O
caveat N
, O
however O
, O
is O
that O
our H
approach N
uses O
tail N
reduction N
as O
the O
mechanism N
for O
CoM O
displacement N
despite O
it O
has O
been O
recently O
shown O
that O
the O
evolutionary O
change O
in O
CoM O
position N
was O
driven O
instead O
by O
forelimb N
enlargement N
[ O
8 O
] O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
this O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
tail N
reduction N
had O
no O
effect N
on O
CoM O
displacement N
, O
but O
that O
it O
was O
not O
the O
most O
important O
factor N
. O

Ideally O
we H
would O
have O
increased O
tail N
mass O
and O
reduced O
pectoral O
limb N
mass O
but O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
this O
is O
not O
experimentally O
feasible O
. O

We H
argue O
that O
our H
experimental O
approach N
, O
although O
not O
perfect O
, O
was O
effective O
in O
displacing O
the O
CoM O
and O
recreating O
locomotor O
patterns N
expected O
in O
non-avian O
theropods A
. O

Thus O
, O
we H
expect O
that O
careful O
phenotypic O
manipulation N
of O
extant O
birds A
can O
open O
new O
avenues N
of O
experimental O
investigation N
into O
unexplored O
facets N
of O
dinosaur A
locomotor O
mechanics N
and O
energetics O
, O
providing O
a O
more O
nuanced O
understanding N
of O
the O
relationship N
between O
form N
and O
function N
in O
dinosaur A
evolution N
. O

inception N
, O
writers H
at O
The O

Early O
life N

Frontpage O

Daniel H
Bernoulli O
was O
born O
in O
Groningen O
, O
in O
the O
Netherlands O
, O
into O
a O
family H
of O
distinguished O
mathematicians H
. O

The O
Bernoulli O
family H
came O
originally O
from O
Antwerp O
, O
at O
that O
time N
in O
the O
Spanish O
Netherlands O
, O
but O
emigrated O
to O
escape O
the O
Spanish O
persecution N
of O
the O
Huguenots O
. O

After O
a O
brief N
period N
in O
Frankfurt O
the O
family H
moved O
to O
Basel O
, O
in O
Switzerland O
. O

Daniel H
was O
a O
son H
of O
Johann H
Bernoulli O
( O
one N
of O
the O
" O
early O
developers H
" O
of O
calculus N
) O
and O
a O
nephew H
of O
Jacob H
Bernoulli O
( O
who O
" O
was O
the O
first O
to O
discover O
the O
theory N
of O
probability N
" O
) O
. O

He O
had O
two O
brothers H
, O
Niklaus O
and O
Johann H
II O
. O

Daniel H
Bernoulli O
was O
described O
by O
W. O
W. O
Rouse O
Ball H
as O
" O
by O
far O
the O
ablest O
of O
the O
younger O
Bernoullis O
" O
. O

He O
is O
said O
to O
have O
had O
a O
bad O
relationship N
with O
his O
father H
. O

Upon O
both O
of O
them O
entering O
and O
tying O
for O
first O
place N
in O
a O
scientific O
contest N
at O
the O
University N
of O
Paris O
, O
Johann H
, O
unable O
to O
bear O
the O
" O
shame N
" O
of O
being O
compared O
Daniel's O
Daniel H
's H
equal O
, O
banned O
Daniel H
from O
his O
house N
. O

Johann H
Bernoulli O
also O
plagiarized O
some O
key N
ideas N
from O
Daniel's O
Daniel H
's H
book O
Hydrodynamica O
in O
his O
own O
book O
Hydraulica O
which O
he O
backdated O
to O
before O
Hydrodynamica O
. O

Despite O
Daniel's O
Daniel H
's H
attempts N
at O
reconciliation N
, O
his O
father H
carried O
the O
grudge N
until O
his O
death N
. O

Around O
schooling O
age N
, O
his O
father H
, O
Johann H
, O
encouraged O
him O
to O
study O
business N
, O
there O
being O
poor O
rewards N
awaiting O
a O
mathematician H
. O

However O
, O
Daniel H
refused O
, O
because O
he O
wanted O
to O
study O
mathematics N
. O

He O
later O
gave O
in O
to O
his O
father's O
father H
's H
wish O
and O
studied O
business N
. O

His O
father H
then O
asked O
him O
to O
study O
in O
medicine N
, O
and O
Daniel H
agreed O
under O
the O
condition N
that O
his O
father H
would O
teach O
him O
mathematics N
privately O
, O
which O
they O
continued O
for O
some O
time N
. O

Daniel H
studied O
medicine N
at O
Basel O
, O
Heidelberg O
, O
and O
Strasbourg O
, O
and O
earned O
a O
PhD N
in O
anatomy N
and O
botany N
in O
1721 O
. O

He O
was O
a O
contemporary O
and O
close O
friend H
of O
Leonhard O
Euler O
. O

He O
went O
to O
St. O
Petersburg O
in O
1724 O
as O
professor H
of O
mathematics N
, O
but O
was O
very O
unhappy O
there O
, O
and O
a O
temporary O
illness N
in O
1733 O
gave O
him O
an O
excuse O
for O
leaving O
St. O
Petersburg O
. O

He O
returned O
to O
the O
University N
of O
Basel O
, O
where O
he O
successively O
held O
the O
chairs N
of O
medicine N
, O
metaphysics O
, O
and O
natural O
philosophy N
until O
his O
death N
. O

In O
May O
, O
1750 O
he O
was O
elected O
a O
Fellow H
of O
the O
Royal O
Society N
. O

Mathematical O
work N

His O
earliest O
mathematical O
work N
was O
the O
Exercitationes O
( O
Mathematical O
Exercises O
) O
, O
published O
in O
1724 O
with O
the O
help O
of O
Goldbach O
. O

Two O
years N
later O
he O
pointed O
out H
for O
the O
first O
time N
the O
frequent O
desirability N
of O
resolving O
a O
compound N
motion N
into O
motions N
of O
translation N
and O
motion N
of O
rotation N
. O

His O
chief O
work N
is O
Hydrodynamica O
, O
published O
in O
1738 O
; O

it O
resembles O
Joseph H
Louis H
Lagrange's O
Lagrange O
's H
Mécanique O
Analytique O
in O
being O
arranged O
so O
that O
all O
the O
results N
are O
consequences N
of O
a O
single O
principle N
, O
namely O
, O
conservation N
of O
energy N
. O

This O
was O
followed O
by O
a O
memoir N
on O
the O
theory N
of O
the O
tides N
, O
to O
which O
, O
conjointly O
with O
the O
memoirs N
by O
Euler O
and O
Colin H
Maclaurin O
, O
a O
prize N
was O
awarded O
by O
the O
French O
Academy O
: O
these O
three O
memoirs N
contain O
all O
that O
was O
done O
on O
this O
subject O
between O
the O
publication N
of O
Isaac H
Newton's O
Newton H
's H
Philosophiae O
Naturalis O
Principia O
Mathematica O
and O
the O
investigations N
of O
Pierre H
- O
Simon H
Laplace O
. O

Bernoulli O
also O
wrote O
a O
large O
number N
of O
papers N
on O
various O
mechanical O
questions N
, O
especially O
on O
problems N
connected O
with O
vibrating O
strings N
, O
and O
the O
solutions N
given O
by O
Brook H
Taylor H
and O
by O
Jean H
le O
Rond O
d'Alembert O
. O

Together O
Bernoulli O
and O
Euler O
tried O
to O
discover O
more O
about O
the O
flow N
of O
fluids N
. O

In O
particular O
, O
they O
wanted O
to O
know O
about O
the O
relationship N
between O
the O
speed N
at O
which O
blood N
flows N
and O
its O
pressure O
. O

To O
investigate O
this O
, O
Daniel H
experimented O
by O
puncturing O
the O
wall N
of O
a O
pipe N
with O
a O
small O
open O
ended O
straw N
and O
noted O
that O
the O
height N
to O
which O
the O
fluid O
rose O
up O
the O
straw N
was O
related O
to O
fluid's O
fluid O
's H
pressure O
in O
the O
pipe N
. O

Soon O
physicians H
all O
over O
Europe O
were O
measuring O
patients' O
patients H
' O
blood N
pressure O
by O
sticking O
point N
- O
ended O
glass N
tubes N
directly O
into O
their O
arteries N
. O

It O
was O
not O
until O
about O
170 O
years N
later O
, O
in O
1896 O
that O
an O
Italian O
doctor H
discovered O
a O
less O
painful O
method N
which O
is O
still O
in O
use H
today N
. O

However O
, O
Bernoulli's O
Bernoulli O
's H
method N
of O
measuring O
pressure O
is O
still O
used O
today N
in O
modern O
aircraft N
to O
measure N
the O
speed N
of O
the O
air N
passing O
the O
plane N
; O
that O
is O
its O
air N
speed N
. O

Taking O
his O
discoveries N
further O
, O
Daniel H
Bernoulli O
now O
returned O
to O
his O
earlier O
work N
on O
Conservation O
of O
Energy N
. O

It O
was O
known O
that O
a O
moving O
body N
exchanges N
its O
kinetic O
energy N
for O
potential N
energy N
when O
it O
gains N
height N
. O

Daniel H
realised O
that O
in O
a O
similar O
way N
, O
a O
moving O
fluid O
exchanges N
its O
kinetic O
energy N
for O
pressure O
. O

Mathematically O
this O
law N
is O
now O
written O
: O
½ O
ρ O
u H
2 O
+ O
P H
= O
constant O
where O
P H
is O
pressure O
, O
ρ O
is O
the O
density N
of O
the O
fluid O
and O
u H
is O
its O
velocity N
. O

A H
consequence N
of O
this O
law N
is O
that O
if O
the O
velocity N
increases O
then O
the O
pressure O
falls O
. O

This O
is O
exploited O
by O
the O
wing N
of O
an O
aeroplane N
which O
is O
designed O
to O
create O
an O
area N
above O
its O
surface N
where O
the O
air N
velocity N
increases O
. O

The O
pressure O
in O
this O
area N
is O
lower O
than O
that O
under O
the O
wing N
, O
so O
the O
wing N
is O
pushed O
upwards O
by O
the O
relatively O
higher O
pressure O
under O
the O
wing N
. O

Early O
years N

Fillmore O
spent O
three O
years N
in O
the O

Following O

he O
taught O
English O
at O
a O
Buddhist O

school N
while O
also O
taking O

He O
returned O

at O
the O
University N

and O
then O
teaching O
at O
The O
Ohio O
State N
University N
in O
Columbus O

At O
the O
time N
, O
he O
was O
still O
a O
proponent H
of O
Noam O
Chomsky's O
Chomsky O
's H
theory N
of O
generative O
grammar N
during O
its O
earliest O
transformational O
grammar N
phase N
. O

In O
1963 O
, O
his O
seminal O
article N
The O
position N
of O
embedding O
transformations N
in O
a O
Grammar N
introduced O
the O
transformational O
cycle N
. O

The O
central O
idea N
is O
to O
first O
apply O
rules N
to O
the O
smallest O
applicable O
unit N
, O
then O
apply O
to O
the O
smallest O
unit N
containing O
that O
one N
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O
[ O

This O
principle N
has O
been O
a O
foundational O
insight N
for O
theories N
of O
syntax N
since O
that O
time N
. O

Cognitive O
linguistics N

By O
1965 O
, O
Fillmore O
had O
come O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
semantics N
plays N
a O
crucial O
role N
in O
grammar N
. O
[ O
6 O
] O

In O
1968 O
, O
he O
published O
his O
theory N
of O
Case O
Grammar N
( O
Fillmore O
1968 O
) O
, O
which O
highlighted O
the O
fact N
that O
syntactic O
structure N
can O
be O
predicted O
by O
semantic O
participants H
. O

An O
action N
can O
have O
an O
agent H
, O
a O
patient H
, O
purposes N
, O
locations N
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

These O
participants H
were O
called O
" O
cases N
" O
in O
his O
original O
paper N
, O
but O
later O
came O
to O
be O
known O
as O
semantic O
roles N
or O
thematic O
relations N
, O
which O
are O
similar O
to O
theta N
roles N
in O
generative O
grammar N
. O

Following O
his O
move O
to O
the O
University N
of O
California O
, O
Berkeley O
, O
in O
1971 O
, O
this O
theory N
eventually O
evolved O
into O
a O
broader O
cognitive O
linguistic O
theory N
called O
Frame N
Semantics O
( O
1976 O
) O
. O

A H
commercial O
event N
, O
for O
instance N
, O
crucially O
involved O
elements N
such O
as O
a O
seller H
, O
a O
buyer H
, O
some O
good O
, O
and O
some O
money N
. O

In O
language N
, O
such O
an O
event N
can O
be O
expressed O
in O
a O
variety N
of O
different O
ways N
, O
e.g. O
using O
the O
verb N
' O
to O
sell O
' O
or O
the O
verb N
' O
to O
buy O
' O
. O

According O
to O
frame O
semantics N
, O
meaning N
is O
best O
studied O
in O
terms N
of O
the O
mental O
concepts N
and O
participants H
in O
the O
minds N
of O
the O
speaker N

Around O

Cruz O
Lectures O
on O
Deixis O
, O
delivered O
in O
1971 O
and O
published O
in O
1975 O
, O
contributed O
to O
establishing O
the O
field N
of O
linguistic O
pragmatics N
, O
which O
studies N
the O
relationship N
between O
linguistic O
form N

In O
all O
of O
this O
research N
, O
he O
illuminated O
the O
fundamental O
importance N
of O
semantics N
, O
and O
its O
role N
in O
motivating O
syntactic O
and O
morphological O
phenomena N
. O

His O
collaboration N
with O
Paul H
Kay H
and O
George H
Lakoff O
was O
generalized O
into O
the O
theory N
of O
Construction N
Grammar N
. O

This O
work N
aimed O
at O
developing O
a O
complete O
theory N
of O
grammar N
that O
would O
fully O
acknowledge O
the O
role N
of O
semantics N
right O
from O
the O
start O
, O
while O
simultaneously O
adopting O
constraint N
- O
based O
formalisms N
as O
popular O
in O
computer N
science N
and O
natural O
language N
processing O
. O

This O
theory N
built O
on O
the O
notion N
of O
construction N
from O
traditional O
and O
pedagogical O
grammars N
rather O
than O
the O
rule N
- O
based O
formalisms N
that O
dominate O
most O
of O

it O
took O
until O

It O
is O
unsurprising O
, O
in O
the O
light N
of O
his O
character A

situation N
at O
the O

that O

did O
not O
ignore O
Poisson's O

advice N

he O
began O
collecting O

[ O

somehow O
talked O

a O

Galois' O
Galois O
' O
fatal O
duel N
took O
place N
on O
30 O
May O
. O
[ O
17 O
] O

The O
true O
motives N
behind O
the O
duel N
are O
obscure O
. O

There O
has O
been O
much O
speculation N
as O
to O
the O
reasons N
behind O
it O
. O

What O
is O
known O
is O
that O
five O
days N
before O
his O
death N
, O
he O
wrote O
a O
letter N
to O
Chevalier H
which O
clearly O
alludes O
to O
a O
broken O
love O
affair N
. O
[ O
7 O
] O

Some O
archival O
investigation N
on O
the O
original O
letters N
suggests O
that O
the O
woman H
of O
romantic O
interest N
was O
a O
Mademoiselle O
Stéphanie O
- O
Félicie O
Poterin O
du O
Motel O
, O
[ O
18 O
] O
the O
daughter H
of O
the O
physician H
at O
the O
hostel N
where O
Galois O
stayed O
during O
the O
last O
months N
of O
his O
life N
. O

Fragments N
of O
letters N
from O
her O
, O
copied O
by O
Galois O
himself O
( O
with O
many O
portions N
, O
such O
as O
her O
name N
, O
either O
obliterated O
or O
deliberately O
omitted O
) O
, O
are O
available O
. O
[ O
19 O

The O
letters N
hint O
that O
Mlle. O
du O
Motel O
had O
confided O
some O
of O
her O
troubles N
to O
Galois O
, O
and O
this O
might O
have O
prompted O
him O
to O
provoke O
the O
duel N
himself O
on O
her O
behalf N
. O

This O
conjecture N
is O
also O
supported O
by O
other O
letters N
Galois O
later O
wrote O
to O
his O
friends H
the O
night N
before O
he O
died O
. O

Galois' O
Galois O
' O
cousin H
, O
Gabriel H
Demante O
, O
when O
asked O
if O
he O
knew O
the O
cause N
of O
the O
duel N
, O
mentioned O
that O
Galois O
" O
found O
himself O
in O
the O
presence N
of O
a O
supposed O
uncle H
and O
a O
supposed O
fiancé O
, O
each O
of O
whom O
provoked O
the O
duel N
. O
" O

Galois O
himself O
famously O
exclaimed O
: O
" O
I H
am O
the O
victim H
of O
an O
infamous O
coquette H
and O
her O
two O
dupes H
. O
" O
[ O

Much O
more O
detailed O
speculation N
based O
on O
these O
scant O
historical O
details N
has O
been O
interpolated O
by O
many O
of O
Galois' O
Galois O
' O
biographers H
( O
most O
notably O
interpolated O
by O
Eric H
Temple H
Bell H
in O
Men H
of O
Mathematics O
) O
, O
such O
as O
the O
frequently O
repeated O
speculation N
that O
the O
entire O
incident N
was O
stage N
- O
managed O
by O
the O
police N

royalist H
factions N
to O
eliminate O

duel N

However O
, O
Dumas O
is O
alone O
in O
this O
assertion N

and O
if O
he O
were O
correct O
it O
is O
unclear O
why O

time N

, O

no O
clear N

this O
conjecture N

On O
the O

few O
days N

, O
who O
was O
imprisoned O
with O

on O
the O

charges N

[ O

Given O
the O
conflicting O
information N
available O
, O
the O
true O
identity N
of O
his O
killer H
may O
well O
be O
lost O
to O
history N

Whatever O
the O
reasons N
behind O
the O
duel N
, O
Galois O
was O
so O
convinced O
of O
his O
impending O
death N
that O
he O
stayed O
up O
all O
night N
writing N
letters N
to O
his O
Republican O
friends H

composing O
what O
would O
become O

Mathematician H

this O

This O

, O
if O

by O
the O

and O
he O
soon O
decided O

He O
changed O

found O
himself O
unable O

, O
after O
further O

, O
he O
joined O
the O
Russian O
army N

distinguished O
himself O
in O
several O
wars N
against O
the O
Turks O
and O
Tatars O
in O
southern O
Russia O
. O

Gordon H
disliked O
the O
Russian O
service N
, O
complaining O
of O
the O
corruption N

venality N
of O
Russian O
officials O
, O

He O
was O
not O
the O

the O
Tsar's O
Tsar H

service N
; O
his O
fellow H
- O
Scots O

and O
against O
the O

Consequently O
, O
he O
was O
for O
the O
remainder N

his O
life N
in O
high O
favour N
with O
the O

confided O

. O

Nor O
did O
she O
realize O
that O
he O
wrote O
popular O
literature N
which O
aimed O
to O
please O
the O
general O
public O
and O
in O
no O
way N
wished O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
serious O
literature N
. O

Her O
mentor H
did O
not O
return O
her O
passionate O
, O
if O
discreet O
, O
love O
for O
him O
, O
and O
instead O
treated O
her O
as O
a O
younger O
sister H
. O

This O
failed O
relationship N
would O
become O
a O
recurrent O
theme N
in O
Higuchi's O
Higuchi O
's H
fiction N
. O

Eventually O
, O
she O
got O
the O
break O
she O
was O
so O
eager O
for O
: O

her O
first O
stories N
were O
published O
in O
a O
minor O
newspaper N
under O
her O
pen N
name N
, O
Ichiyo O
Higuchi O
. O

The O
stories N
from O
this O
first O
period N
( O
1892 O
– O
94 O
) O
suffered O
from O
the O
excessive O
influence N
of O
Heian O
poetry N
. O

Higuchi O
felt N
compelled O
to O
demonstrate O
her O
classical O
literary O
training N
. O

The O
plots N
were O
thin O
, O
there O
was O
little O
development N
of O
character A
and O
they O
were O
loaded O
down O
by O
excessive O
sentiment N
, O
especially O
when O
compared O
to O
what O
she O
was O
writing N
concurrently O
in O
her O
diary N
. O

But O
she O
was O
developing O
rapidly O
. O

Several O
of O
her O
trademark N
themes N
appear O
; O
for O
example N
, O
the O
triangular O
relationship N
among O
a O
lonely O
, O
beautiful O
, O
young O
woman H
who O
has O
lost O
her O
parents H
, O
a O
handsome O
man H
who O
has O
abandoned O
her O
( O
and O
remains O
in O
the O
background N
) O
, O
and O
a O
lonely O
and O
desperate O
ragamuffin H
who O
falls O
in O
love O
with O
her O
. O

Another O
theme N
Higuchi O
repeated O
was O
the O
ambition N
and O
cruelty N
of O
the O
Meiji O
middle O
class N
. O

The O
story N
" O
Umoregi O
" O
( O
" O
In O
Obscurity O
" O
) O
signaled O
Higuchi's O
Higuchi O
's H
arrival H
as O
a O
professional O
writer H
. O

It O
was O
published O
in O
the O
prestigious O
journal N
Miyako O
no O
Hana O
in O
1892 O
, O
only O
nine O
months N
after O
she O
had O
started O
writing N
in O
earnest N
. O

Her O
work N
was O
noticed O
and O
she O
was O
recognized O
as O
a O
promising O
new O
author H
. O

Her O
last O
years N

In O
1893 O
, O
Higuchi O
, O
her O
mother H
and O
her O
sister H
abandoned O
their O
middle O
class N
house N
and O
, O
with O
a O
grim O
determination N
to O
survive O
, O
moved O
to O
a O
poor O
neighborhood N
where O
they O
opened O
a O
stationery N
store N
that O
before O
long O
failed O
. O

Their O
new O
dwelling N
was O
a O
five O

walk O
from O
Tokyo's O
Tokyo O
's H
ill O
- O
famed O
red O
- O
light N
district N
, O
the O
Yoshiwara O
. O

Her O
experience N
living O
in O
this O
neighborhood N
would O
provide O
material O
for O
several O
of O
her O
later O
stories N
, O
especially O

The O
stories N
of O
her O
mature O
period N
( O
1894 O
– O
96 O
) O
were O
not O
only O
marked O
by O
her O
experience N
living O
near O
the O
red O
- O
light N
district N
and O
greater O
concern N
over O
the O
plight N
of O
women H

also O
by O
the O
influence N

Saikaku O
, O
a O
17th O
- O
century N
writer H
, O
whose O
stories N
she O
had O
recently O
discovered O
. O

His O
distinctiveness N
lay O
in O
great O
part N
in O
his O
acceptance N
of O
low O
- O
life N
characters A
as O
worthwhile O
literary O
subjects N
. O

What O
Higuchi O
added O
was O
a O
special O
awareness N
of O
suffering N
and O
sensitivity N
. O

life N

especially O
to O
those O
living O
in O
cosmopolitan O
centers N
such O
as O
Rome O
. O

In O
many O
cases N
, O
he O
focused O
his O
attention N
on O
the O
lives O
of O
women H
and O
identified O
how O
a O
woman H
devoted O
to O
Jesus H
should O
live O
her O
life N
. O

This O
focus O
stemmed O
from O
his O
close O
patron H
relationships N
with O
several O
prominent O
female O
ascetics H
who O
were O
members H
of O
affluent O
senatorial O
families N
. O

Life N

Eusebius O
Sophronius O
Hieronymus O
was O
born O
at O
Stridon O
around O
347 O
AD N
. O
[ O
9 O
] O

He O
was O
of O
Illyrian O
ancestry H
, O
[ O
10 O
] O
although O
his O
ability N
to O
speak O
the O
Illyrian O
languages N
causes N
controversy N
. O

He O
was O
not O
baptized O
until O
about O
360 O
- O
366 O
, O
when O
he O
had O
gone O
to O
Rome O
with O
his O
friend H
Bonosus O
of O
Sardica O
( O
who O
may O
or O
may O
not O
have O
been O
the O
same O
Bonosus O
whom O
Jerome H
identifies O
as O
his O
friend H
who O
went O
to O
live O
as O
a O
hermit H
on O
an O
island N
in O
the O
Adriatic O
) O
to O
pursue O
rhetorical O
and O
philosophical O
studies N
. O

He O
studied O
under O
the O
grammarian H
Aelius O
Donatus O
. O

There O
Jerome H
learned O
Latin O
and O
at O
least O
some O
Greek O
, O
[ O
11 O
] O
though O
probably O
not O
the O
familiarity N
with O
Greek O
literature N
he O
would O
later O
claim O
to O
have O
acquired O
as O
a O
schoolboy H
. O
[ O
12 O
] O

As O
a O
student H
in O
Rome O
, O
Jerome H
engaged O
in O
the O
superficial O
escapades N
and O
sexual O
experimentation N
of O
students H
there O
, O
which O
he O
indulged O
in O
quite O
casually O
but O
for O
which O
he O
suffered O
terrible O
bouts N
of O
guilt N
afterwards O
. O
[ O
13 O
] O
[ O
better O
source N
needed O
] O

To O
appease O
his O
conscience N
, O
he O
would O
visit O
on O
Sundays O
the O
sepulchres N
of O
the O
martyrs H
and O
the O
Apostles H
in O
the O
catacombs N
. O

This O
experience N
would O
remind O
him O
of O
the O
terrors N
of O
hell N
: O

Often O
I H
would O
find O
myself H
entering O
those O
crypts N
, O
deep O
dug O
in O
the O
earth N
, O
with O
their O
walls N
on O
either O
side N
lined O
with O
the O
bodies N
of O
the O
dead O
, O
where O
everything O
was O
so O
dark O
that O
almost O
it O
seemed O
as O
though O
the O
Psalmist's O
Psalmist O
's H
words N
were O
fulfilled O
, O
Let O
them O
go O
down O
quick O
into O
Hell O
. O
[ O
14 O
] O

Here O
and O
there O
the O
light N
, O
not O
entering O
in O
through O
windows N
, O
but O
filtering O
down O
from O
above O
through O
shafts N
, O
relieved O
the O
horror N
of O
the O
darkness N
. O

But O
again O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
you H
found O
yourself H
cautiously O
moving O
forward O
, O
the O
black O
night N
closed O
around O
and O
there O
came O
to O
my H
mind N
the O
line N
of O
Vergil O
, O
" O
Horror O
ubique O

St. O
Jerome H
in O
His O
Study N
( O
1480 O
) O
, O
by O
Domenico H
Ghirlandaio O

Jerome H
used O
a O
quote N
from O
Virgil H
— O
" O
On O
all O
sides N
round O
horror N
spread O
wide O
; O
the O
very O
silence N
breathed O
a O
terror N
on O
my H
soul N
" O
[ O
17 O
] O
— O
to O
describe O
the O
horror N
of O
hell N
. O

Jerome H
initially O
used O
classical O
authors H
to O
describe O
Christian O
concepts N
such O
as O
hell N
that O
indicated O
both O
his O
classical O
education N
and O
his O
deep O
shame N
of O
their O
associated O
practices N
, O
such O
as O
pederasty N
which O
was O
found O
in O
Rome O
. O

Conversion N
to O
Christianity O

St H
Jerome H
in O
the O
Nuremberg O
Chronicle O
" O

Although O
initially O
skeptical O
of O
Christianity O
, O
he O
was O
eventually O
converted O
. O
[ O
18 O
] O

After O
several O
years N
in O
Rome O
, O
he O
travelled O
with O
Bonosus O
to O
Gaul O
and O
settled O
in O
Trier O
where O
he O
seems O
to O
have O
first O
taken O
up O
theological O
studies N
, O
and O
where O
, O
for O
his O
friend H
Tyrannius O
Rufinus O
, O
he O
copied O
Hilary H
of O
Poitiers' O
Poitiers O
' O
commentary N
on O
the O
Psalms O
and O
the O
treatise N
De H
synodis O
. O

Next O
came O
a O
stay O
of O
at O
least O
several O
months N
, O
or O
possibly O
years N
, O
with O
Rufinus O
at O
Aquileia O
, O
where O
he O
made O
many O
Christian O
friends H
. O

Some O
of O
these O
accompanied O
Jerome H
when O
about O
373 O
, O
he O
set O
out H
on O
a O
journey N
through O
Thrace O
and O
Asia O
Minor O
into O
northern O
Syria O
. O

At O
Antioch O
, O
where O
he O
stayed O
the O
longest O
, O
two O
of O
his O
companions H
died O
and O
he O
himself O
was O
seriously O
ill O
more O
than O
once O
. O

During O
one N
of O
these O
illnesses N
( O
about O
the O
winter N
of O
373 O
- O
374 O
) O
, O
he O
had O
a O
vision N
that O
led O
him O
to O
lay O
aside O
his O
secular O
studies N
and O
devote O
himself O
to O
God H
. O

He O
seems O
to O
have O
abstained O
for O
a O
considerable O
time N
from O
the O
study O
of O
the O
classics N
and O
to O
have O
plunged O
deeply O
into O
that O
of O
the O
Bible O
, O
under O
the O
impulse N
of O
Apollinaris O
of O
Laodicea O
, O
then O
teaching O
in O
Antioch O
and O
not O
yet O
suspected O
of O
heresy N
. O

St. O
Jerome H
in O

Seized O
with O
a O
desire N
for O
a O
life N
of O
ascetic O
penance N
, O
Jerome H
went O
for O
a O
time N

, O
to O
the O
southeast O
of O
Antioch O
, O
known O
as O
the O
" O

" O
, O
from O
the O
number N
of O
eremites H

it O
. O

During O
this O
period N
, O
he O
seems O
to O
have O
found O
time N
for O
studying O
and O
writing N

He O
made O
his O
first O
attempt N

under O
the O
guidance N

a O
converted O
Jew H
; O
and O
he O
seems O
to O
have O
been O
in O
correspondence N
with O
Jewish O
Christians H
in O
Antioch O
. O

Around O
this O
time N
he O
had O
copied O
for O
him O
a O
Hebrew O
Gospel O
, O
of O
which O
fragments N
are O
preserved O
in O
his O
notes N

is O
known O
today N

the O
Gospel O

Theories N

Nida O
has O
been O
a O
pioneer H
in O
the O
fields N
of O
translation N
theory N
and O
linguistics N
. O

His O
Ph.D. O
dissertation N
, O
A H
Synopsis O
of O
English O
Syntax O
, O
was O
the O
first O
full O
- O
scale N
analysis N
of O
a O
major O
language N
according O
to O
the O
" O
immediate O
- O
constituent N
" O
theory N
. O

His O
textbook N
Morphology O
: O
The O
Descriptive O
Analysis O
of O
Words O
was O
one N
of O
the O
major O
works O
of O
American O
Structuralism O
. O

It O
remained O
the O
only O
thorough O
introduction N
to O
the O
field N
for O
decades N
and O
is O
still O
valuable O
for O
its O
many O
examples N
and O
exercises N
. O

His O
most O
notable O
contribution N
to O
translation N
theory N
is O
Dynamic O
Equivalence O
, O
also O
known O
as O
Functional O
Equivalence O
. O

For O
more O
information N
, O
see O
" O
Dynamic O
and O
formal O
equivalence N
. O
" O

Nida O
also O
developed O
the O
componential O
analysis N
technique N
, O
which O
split O
words N
into O
their O
components N
to O
help O
determine O
equivalence N
in O
translation N
( O
e.g. O
" O
bachelor H
" O
= O
male O
+ O
unmarried O
) O
. O

This O
is O
, O
perhaps O
, O
not O
the O
best O
example N
of O
the O
technique N
, O
though O
it O
is O
the O
most O
well O
- O
known O
. O

Nida's O
Nida O
's H
dynamic O
- O
equivalence N
theory N
is O
often O
held O
in O
opposition N
to O
the O
views N
of O
philologists H
who O
maintain O
that O
an O
understanding N
of O
the O
source N
text N
( O
ST O
) O
can O
be O
achieved O
by O
assessing O
the O
inter-animation O
of O
words N
on O
the O
page N
, O
and O
that O
meaning N
is O
self O
- O
contained O
within O
the O
text N
( O
i.e. O
much O
more O
focused O
on O
achieving O
semantic O
equivalence N
) O
. O

This O
theory N
, O
along O
with O
other O
theories N
of O
correspondence N
in O
translating O
, O
are O
elaborated O
in O
his O
essay N
Principles O
of O
Correspondence O
, O
where O
Nida O
begins O
by O
asserting O
that O
given O
that O
" O
no O
two O
languages N
are O
identical O
, O
either O
in O
the O
meanings N
given O
to O
corresponding O
symbols N
or O
in O
the O
ways N
in O
which O
symbols N
are O
arranged O
in O
phrases N
and O
sentences N
, O
it O
stands O
to O
reason N
that O
there O
can O
be O
no O
absolute O
correspondence N
between O
languages N
. O

Hence O
, O
there O
can O
be O
no O
fully O
exact O
translations N
. O
" O

While O
the O
impact N
of O
a O
translation N
may O
be O
close O
to O
the O
original O
, O
there O
can O
be O
no O
identity N
in O
detail N
. O

Nida O
then O
sets N
forth O
the O
differences N
in O
translation N
, O
as O
he O
would O
account O
for O
it O
, O
within O
three O
basic O
factors N
: O

1. O
The O
nature N
of O
the O
message N
: O
in O
some O
messages N
the O
content N
is O
of O
primary O
consideration N
, O
and O
in O
others O
the O
form N
must O
be O
given O
a O
higher O
priority N
. O

2. O
The O
purpose N
of O
the O
author H
and O
of O
the O
translator H
: O
to O
give O
information N
on O
both O
form N
and O
content N
; O
to O
aim N
at O
full O
intelligibility N
of O
the O
reader H
so O
he O
/ O
she O
may O
understand O
the O
full O
implications N
of O
the O
message N
; O
for O
imperative O
purposes N
that O
aim N
at O
not O
just O
understanding N
the O
translation N
but O
also O
at O
ensuring O
no O
misunderstanding N
of O
the O
translation N
. O

3. O
The O
type N
of O
audience N
: O
prospective O
audiences N
differ O
both O
in O
decoding N
ability N
and O
in O
potential N
interest N
. O

Nida O
brings O
in O
the O
reminder N
that O
while O
there O
are O
no O
such O
things N
as O
" O
identical O
equivalents N
" O
in O
translating O
, O
what O
one N
must O
in O
translating O
seek O
to O
do O
is O
find O
the O
" O
closest O
natural O
equivalent N
" O
. O

Here O
he O
identifies O
two O
basic O
orientations N
in O
translating O
based O
on O
two O
different O
types N
of O
equivalence N
: O

Formal O
Equivalence O
( O
F O
- O
E H
) O
and O
Dynamic O
Equivalence O
( O
D H
- O
E H
) O
. O

F O
- O
E H
focuses O
attention N
on O
the O
message N
itself O
, O
in O
both O
form N
and O
content N
. O

Such O
translations N
then O
would O
be O
concerned O
with O
such O
correspondences N
as O
poetry N
to O
poetry N
, O
sentence N
to O
sentence N
, O
and O
concept N
to O
concept N
. O

Such O
a O
formal O
orientation N
that O
typifies O
this O
type N
of O
structural O
equivalence N
is O
called O
a O
" O
gloss N
translation N
" O
in O
which O
the O
translator H
aims O
at O
reproducing O
as O
literally O
and O
meaningfully O
as O
possible O
the O
form N
and O
content N
of O
the O
original O
. O

The O
principles N
governing O
an O
F O
- O
E H
translation N
would O
then O
be O
: O
reproduction N
of O
grammatical O
units N
; O

Theodorus O
of O
Tabennese O

Biography N

According O
to O
hagiography N
, O
Theodorus O
was O
born O
into O
a O
wealthy O
Christian O
family H
and O
was O
well O
educated O
from O
a O
young O
age N
. O

Early O
in O
life N
he O
denied O
the O
excesses N
of O
his O
parents H
, O
and O
at O
the O
age N
of O
fourteen N
joined O
a O
monastery N
in O
the O
diocese N
of O
Sne O
, O
near O
the O
modern O
town N
of O
Esna O
, O
Egypt O
. O

A H
brother H
from O
Theodorus’ O
Theodorus O
’ O
monastery N
stayed O
with O
Pachomius O
in O
Tabennese O
while O
traveling O
and O
preached O
of O
the O
virtues N
of O
the O
Koinonia O
upon O
his O
return O
to O
Sne O
. O

Praying O
and O
weeping N
, O
Theodorus O
became O
determined O
that O
his O
destiny N
lay O
with O
Pachomius O
. O

Although O
initially O
denied O
passage N
to O
Tabennese O
by O
a O
Pachomian O
monk H
due O
to O
his O
wealthy O
background N
, O
Theodorus O
opted O
to O
follow O
the O
visiting O
monk H
, O
and O
his O
persistence N
( O
and O
lack N
of O
obedience N
) O
paid O
off O
. O

He O
was O
welcomed O
by O
Pachomius O
upon O
his O
arrival H
, O
and O
quickly O
integrated O
into O
the O
community N
at O
Tabennese O
around O
328 O
. O

Quickly O
becoming O
a O
favorite O
of O
Pachomius O
, O
Theodorus O
lived O
an O
enviably O
ascetic O
life N
in O
the O
monastery N
, O
and O
took O
on O
the O
title N
of O
the O
" O
brothers’ O
brothers H
’ O
comforter H
" O
. O

Theodorus O
asserted O
his O
influence N
openly O
( O
which O
resulted O
in O
reprimands N
from O
Pachomius O
) O
and O
generally O
maintained O
himself O
as O
a O
prominent O
figure O
at O
Tabennese O
for O
several O
years N
, O
despite O
never O
being O
given O
a O
position N
of O
power N
in O
the O
monastic O
hierarchy N
. O

Finally O
, O
Pachomius O
called O
on O
him O
to O
preach O
to O
the O
brothers H
despite O
his O
youth H
, O
and O
eventually O
appointed O
him O
steward H
of O
Tabennese O
after O
several O
new O
monasteries N
had O
been O
built O
. O

Retiring O
to O
the O
monastery N
of O
Phbow O
, O
Pachomius O
gave O
Theodorus O
complete O
control N
over O
Tabennese O
, O
though O
recalled O
him O
from O
the O
position N
after O
witnessing O
several O
monks H
under O
Theodorus’ O
Theodorus O
’ O
watch O
violating O
the O
monastic O
rules N
without O
reprimand N
. O

Having O
failed O
to O
prove O
his O
governing O
ability N
and O
once O
more O
in O
a O
position N
no O
higher O
than O
when O
he O
had O
entered O
the O
monastery N
, O
Theodorus O
became O
a O
personal O
assistant O
to O
Pachomius O
and O
remained O
relatively O
quiet N
for O
some O
years N
. O

Despite O
his O
clear N
potential N
and O
popularity N
, O
Pachomius O
refused O
to O
grant N
Theodorus O
any O
kind N
of O
authority N
; O
though O
the O
old O
man's O
man H
's H
failing O
health N
soon O
changed O
things N
forever O
. O

After O
Theodorus O
had O
been O
assisting O
Pachomius O
at O
Tabennese O
for O
several O
years N
following O
his O
demotion N
, O
Pachomius O
became O
very O
ill O
and O
seemed O
to O
be O
on O
the O
verge N
of O
death N
. O

Pachomius O
had O
not O
named O
a O
successor N
, O
and O
several O
brothers H
pleaded O
with O
Theodorus O
to O
assert O
himself O
as O
head N
of O
the O
Koinonia O
when O
the O
sickly O
man H
died O
. O

Despite O
the O
assertion N
that O
Theodorus O
apparently O
did O
not O
want O
the O
rank N
of O
a O
father H
or O
this O
world's O
world N
's H
glory N
, O
he O
consented O
. O

Unfortunately O
for O
the O
would O
- O
be O
leader H
, O
Pachomius O
recovered O
, O
and O
upon O
hearing O
of O
Theodorus’ O
Theodorus O
’ O
decision N
, O
exiled O
the O
ambitious O
young O
man H
. O

After O
living O
a O
life N
of O
constant O
weeping N
and O
prayer N
in O
solitude N
, O
Pachomius O
forgave O
Theodorus O
and O
allowed O
him O
to O
live O
among O
the O
brothers H
once O
more O
. O

Normalcy N
returned O
, O
though O
never O
again O
would O
Pachomius O
fully O
trust N
his O
former O
protégé O
. O

In O
348 O
Pachomius O
died O
, O
naming O
the O
brother H
Petronios O
as O
his O
successor N
rather O
than O
the O
clearly O
qualified O
Theodorus O
. O

The O
death N
of O
Petronios O
later O
that O
year N
would O
leave O
Apa O
Horsiesios O
in O
charge O
, O
and O
the O
popular O
Theodorus O
would O
retreat N
to O
the O
distant O
monastery N
of O
Phnoum O
. O

Although O
it O
seems O
Theodorus O
practiced O
complete O
submission N
to O
the O
new O
leader H
of O
the O
Koinonia O
, O
problems N
soon O
arose O
in O
several O
Pachomian O
monasteries N
that O
viewed O
Horsiesios O
as O
a O
weak O
leader H
. O

Refusing O
to O
work N
or O
communicate O
and O
demanding O
a O
new O
leader H
, O
many O
of O
the O
elder H
monks H
completely O
abandoned O
any O
notion N
of O
obedience N
to O
Horsiesios O
. O

The O
federation N
of O
monasteries N
was O
falling O
apart O
, O
and O
Theodorus O
rushed O
to O
Tabennese O
to O
placate O
the O
rebels H
. O

Soon O
after O
his O
arrival H
, O
Theodorus O
was O
the O
new O
de O
facto O
leader H
, O
though O
he O
claimed O
to O
be O
only O
acting N
on O
behalf N
of O
Horsiesios O
. O

For O
eighteen O
years N
Theodorus O
administered O
from O
Pachomius’ O
Pachomius O
’ O
old O
headquarters N
in O
Phbow O
, O
using O
techniques N
far O
more O
assertive O
than O
his O
predecessors H
, O
such O
as O
constantly O
shuffling O
the O
offices N
and O
locations N
of O
the O
most O
ambitious O
monks H
. O

Yet O
in O
spite N
of O
this O
somewhat O
unstable O
shifting N
, O
the O
Koinonia O
was O
ruled O
peacefully O
for O
nearly O
two O
decades N
, O
at O
which O
point N
Theodorus O
predicted O
he O
would O
soon O
die O
. O

Within O
a O
few O
months N
his O
prediction N
came O
true O
, O
and O
Apa O
Horsiesios O
once O
more O
took O
his O
place N
as O
the O
head N
of O
the O
communities N
in O
both O
title N
and O
authority N

three O
items N
. O

I H
have O
here O
, O
some O
ice N
in O
a O
pan N
, O
water N
in O
this O
glass N
, O
and O
steam N
rising O
from O
this O
pot N
. O

Now O
, O
I H
would O
like O
to O
ask O
you H
, O
how O
these O
three O
things N
. O

Tell O
me H
please O
. O

How O
are O
they O
all O
alike O
. O

These O
three O
things N
. O

This O
ice N
here O
in O
this O
pan N
. O

This O
water N
in O
this O
glass N
, O
and O
the O
steam N
rising O
from O
this O
pot N
, O
just O
yell O
it O
out H
, O
we H
are O
informal O
here O
, O
yes O
. O

Correct O
. O

They O
are O
all O
forms N
of O
water N
. O

This O
ice N
here O
of O
course N
is O
water N
, O
I H
told O
you H
there O
was O
water N
in O
this O
glass N
, O
and O
you H
have O
all O
seen O
water N
boil N
at O
home N
, O
so O
you H
are O
familiar O
with O
steam N
. O

But O
now O
let's O
let O
's H
try O
to O
figure O
out H
how O
they're O
they O
're O
different O
, O
we'll O
we H
'll O
look O
at O
temperature N
, O
first O
. O

And O
the O
temperature N
of O
this O
water N
here O
, O
the O
ice N
, O
is O
, O
about O
uh O
twenty O
- O
four O
– O
woo- O
nineteen O
degrees N
. O

Very O
cold O
. O

The O
temperature N
of O
this O
w- O
water N
here O
, O
is O
sixty O
- O
four O
degrees N
, O
the O
temperature N
of O
this O
steam N
, O
is O
, O
I H
know O
it's O
it O
's H
hotter O
than O
that O
. O

Yeah O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
about O
a O
hundred O
and O
eleven O
degrees N
. O

Okay O
. O

Fahrenheit O
. O

Okay O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
by O
the O
way N
guys H
, O
what O
do O
we H
call O
something O
that's O
that O
's H
hard O
, O
like O
this O
ice N
here O
, O
or O
a O
table N
, O
or O
a O
rock N
? O

We H
call O
it O
a O
? O

Solid O
. O

Very O
good O
. O

You H
should O
g- O
— O
you H
should O
be O
a O
choir N
. O

You H
should O
go O
out H
on O
the O
road N
there O
, O
like O
, O
yeah O
. O

We H
are O
. O

Y- O
— O
oh O
well O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
glad O
to O
meet O
you H
. O

Please O
give O
me H
your H
itinerary N
after O
the O
show O
. O

Yes O
. O

Yes O
. O

Of O
course N
we H
call O
it O
a O
sholids N
. O

A H
solid N
. O

And O
a O
solid N
has O
one N
shape N
. O

The O
shape N
that O
it O
starts O
out H
with O
. O

And O
what O
do O
we H
call O
something O
that O
you H
_ O
— O
that O
you H
can O
splish O
splash N
? O

Take O
a O
bath N
in O
. O

Anything O
wet O
like O
soda N
or O
milk N
. O

Liquid O
. O

You're O
You H
're O
not O
gonna O
gon O
na O
let O
me H
finish O
, O
are O
you H
? O

Yes O
, O
we H
call O
it O
a O
? O

Liquid O
. O

Very O
good O
. O

And O
a O
liquid N
can O
change O
its O
shape N
, O
to O
f- O
completely O
fill O
the O
bottom N
of O
whatever O
container N
you H
put O
it O
in O
. O

And O
finally O
, O
what O
do O
we H
call O
something O
that's O
that O
's H
loose O
, O
and O
floating O
around O
like O
this O
steam N
here O
? O

Or O
a O
cloud N
, O
or O
the O
air N
we H
breathe O
, O
we H
call O
it O
a O
? O

Gas N
. O

Correct O
. O

A H
gas N
. O

And O
a O
gas N
completely O
fills O
whatever O
shape N
container N
you H
put O
it O
in O
. O

And O
so O
, O
how O
do O
you H
get O
water N
to O
change O
, O
from O
a O
solid N
, O
to O
a O
liquid N
, O
to O
a O
gas N
, O
and O
back O
and O
forth O
? O

Add O
energy N
. O

Woo O
. O

I H
like O
the O
way N
he O
expressed O
that O
. O

Never O
before O
have O
I H
heard O
it O
, O
add O
or O
subtract O
energy N
, O
or O
, O
heat N
, O
change O
the O
temperature N
, O
basically O
. O

Correct O
? O

Alright O
. O

Well O
folks N
, O
now O
I'm O
I H
'm O
going O
to O
show O
you H
something O
else O
that O
happens O
when O
you H
change O
the O
temperature N
, O
and O
that's O
that O
's H
where O
these O
balloons N
come O
in O
. O

I H
have O
here O
a O
number N
of O
balloons N
, O
but O
, O
l- O
let's O
let O

these O
balloons N
, O
I H
can O
fit O
, O
into O
this O
little O
itty O
- O
bitty O
container N
here O

. O

That's O
That O
's H
another O
thing N
too O
, O
is O
I H
kinda O
had O
a O
b- O
general O
idea N
, O
of O
kinda O
how O
to O
do O
it O
, O
just O
watching O

. O

Or O
— O
and O
watching O
, O
people N
come O
to O
our H
place N
, O
and O
doing O
it O
and O
stuff N
you H
know O
. O

And O
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Then O
, O
down O
there O
, O
um O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
mandatory O
. O

You H
have O
to O
— O
to O
graduate H
, O
you H
know O
, O
or O
well O
, O
to O
get O
the O
degree N
, O
you H
know O
, O
you H
have O
to O
take O
this O
class N
. O

And O
you H
can O
only O
take O
— O
if O
you H
want O
to O
, O
you H
can O
only O
take O
it O
for O
eight O
weeks N
. O

And O
, O
if O
you H
wanna O
wan O
na O
go O
on O
in O
it O
, O
you H
n- O
— O
then O
, O
you H
can O
go O
on O
. O

You H
know O
. O

And O
I H
decided O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
go O
on O
in O
it O
. O

And O
the O
first O
part N
of O
it O
, O
is O
like O
, O
well O
we H
have O
lecture N
, O
then O
we H
have O
lab N
. O

And O
like O
, O
the O
first O
part N
of O
it O
, O
we H
just O
go O
into O
the O
classroom N
, O
and O
he O
like O
... O

In O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
year N
there O
was O
a O
lot N
of O
classroom N
work N
. O

I H
mean O
, O
it O
— O
that's O
that O
's H
just O
kinda O
how O
it O
happens O
, O
you H
know O
, O
because O
he O
kinda O
has O
to O
tell O
you H
... O

They O
go O
over O
the O
whole O
, O
the O
whole O
part N
of O
the O
horse A
. O

I H
mean O
, O
all O
the O
skeleton N
part N
of O
it O
you H
know O
, O
and O
— O
and O
they O
go O
through O
every O
kind N
a O
ligament N
. O

And O
I H
mean O
, O
there's O
there O
's H
, O
millions N
of O
ligaments N
, O
and O
millions N
of O
tendons N
, O
you H
know O
, O
well O
not O
millions N
, O
but O
, O
I H
mean O
... O

Yeah O
, O
I H
bet N
. O

And O
then O
, O
so O
we H
had O
to O
know O
these O
tendons N
, O
and O
ligaments N
, O
and O
then O
, O
all O
the O
bones N
, O
and O
, O
you H
know O
, O
all O
the O
way N
up O
– O
from O
the O
shoulder N
down O
, O
and O
then O
from O
the O
hip N
down O
. O

You H
know O
, O
all O
the O
way N
down O
to O
the O
hoof N
, O
and O
then O
, O
the O
bone N
in O
the O
hoof N
, O
and O
, O
then O
all O
the O
wall N
, O
and O
, O
you H
know O
, O
of O
the O
hoof N
, O
and O
, O
what O
everything O
was O
called O
there O
, O
and O
then O
, O
he O
went O
over O
on O
how O
to O
trim O
it O
, O
and O
where O
you H
trim O
— O

Th- O
there's O
there O
's H
a O
white O
line N
, O
that O
you H
go O
by O
, O
and O
a O
horse A
has O
this O
little O
white O
line N
, O
and O
you H
clean O
it O
out H
with O
the O
— O
with O
the O
hoof N
knife N
. O

You H
know O
? O

And O
then O
there O
— O
and O
then O
you H
can O
see O
this O
little O
white O
line N
? O

And O
that's O
that O
's H
kinda O
where O
you H
go O
by O
, O
to O
— O

You H
know O
, O
the O
horse A
kinda O
helps O
you H
out H
, O
because O
it O
, O
has O
that O
little O
white O
line N
right O
there O
. O

Mhm O
. O

And O
that's O
that O
's H
where O
you H
kinda O
— O
kinda O
need O
a O
little O
guide N
, O
of O
where O
you H
trim O
. O

And O
, O
I H
am O
still O
scared O
to O
do O
it O
. O

Because O
, O
you H
know O
, O
I H
mean O
, O
you H
can O
make O
a O
horse A
go O
lame O
, O
by O
doing O
it O
. O

Really O
? O

Well O
you H
can O
trim O
em O
too O
short O
. O

And O
make O
em O
, O
you H
know O
, O
and O
they're O
they O
're O
just O
a O
little O
bit N
, O
for O
f- O
the O
first O
couple N
of O
days N
, O
you H
know O
, O
I H
mean O
they're O
they O
're O
just O
sore O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
not O
bad O
, O
but O
sometimes O
you H
can O
get O
it O
really O
bad O
. O

You H
can O
really O
make O
a O
horse A
really O
bad O
. O

And O
they O
m- O

You H
know O
then O
, O
they O
have O
to O
, O
like O
, O
keep O
em O
, O
away O
from O
anything O
, O
you H
know O
, O
get O
em O
really O
in O
the O
soft O
ground N
, O
and O
, O
no O
hard O
pebbles N
, O
or O
hard O
clods N
of O
dirt N
or O
anything O
? O

So O
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
a O
little O
scared O
about O
doing O
it O
yet O
. O

You H
know O
, O
I H
get O
em O
really O
long O
. O

I H
mean O
they're O
they O
're O
still O
long O
, O
when O
I H
get O
done O
with O
them O
. O

A H
lot N
of O
times N
, O
like O
, O
I'll O
I H
'll O
get O
done O
, O
and O
I'll O
I H
'll O
think O
I'm O
I H
'm O
done O
, O
and O
I'll O
I H
'll O
look O
at O
– O
look O
down O
at O
the O
horse's O
horse A
's H
hoof N
, O
and O
it's O
it O
's H
still O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
too O
long O
. O

And O
then O
like O
, O
I H
would O
never O
, O
ever O
, O
ever O
, O
trust N
myself H
, O
to O
shoe N
a O
horse A
. O

See O
we H
did O
that O
too O
. O

We H
did O
— O
we H
did O
a O
lot N
of O
stuff N
. O

We H
did O
a O
lot N
of O
stuff N
with O
the O
— O
like O
we H
had O
the O
, O
um O
, O
the O
burners N
? O

You H
know O
, O
and O
you'd O
you H
'd O
put O
the O
— O
you'd O
you H
'd O
have O
— O
you H
started O
out H
with O
the O
straight O
iron N
? O

You H
know O
? O

And O
you'd O
you H
'd O
stick N
it O
into O
the O
, O
into O
the O
, O
you H
know O
like O
, O
actual O
blacksmithing O
. O

And O
you'd O
you H
'd O
put O
it O
into O
the O
hot O
coals N
, O
you H
know O
? O

And O
then O
, O
we'd O
we H
'd O
— O
I H
I H
– O
straight O
bar N
. O

And O
we'd O
we H
'd O
make O
it O
a O
— O
a O
horseshoe N
out H
of O
it O
, O
you H
know O
? O

But O
, O
these O
shoes N
we H
never O
did O
put O
on O
a O
horse A
. O

We H
just O
put O
the O
shoes N
that O
were O
already O
made O
, O
on O
a O
horse A
. O

And O
that's O
that O
's H
as O
far O
as O
we H
got O
. O

I H
mean O
, O
if O
you H
would O
really O
get O
into O
it O
, O
well O
as O
a O
matter N
of O
fact N
, O
this O
is O
really O
funny O
. O

You H
know O
, O

isn't O
is O
n't O
really O
any O
girl H

the O
m- O

the O
reason N
they O

and O
— O
plus O
the O
knowledge N
of O

bones N
and O
ligaments N
. O

Which O
we H
had O
, O
we H

it O
in O
another O

of O
a O
double O
thing N
that O
, O
we H
had O
in O
— O
in O
another O
class N
, O
so O

who's O
who O
's H
here O
now O
. O

Mr. N
Roberts H
? O

Right O
here O
. O

And O
you H
brought O
an O
action N
, O
against O
uh O
Matthew H
Collins H
, O
for O
um O
, O
roughly O
seven O
- O
hundred O
dollars N
, O
for O
labor N
installing O
a O
carpet N
. O

T- O
uh O
, O
during O
last O
uh O
August O
to O
September O
. O

Okay O
, O
and O
uh O
, O
just O
tell O
me H
about O
how O
you H
arrived O
at O
uh O
this O
claim O
. O

Uh O
I H
was O
called O
by O
Matthew H
here O
, O
to O
do O
the O
job N
for O
him O
. O

So O
I H
went O
out H
and O
looked O
at O
the O
job N
— O

Okay O
, O
you H
run O
a O
— O
you H
run O
a O
a O
carpet N
business N
I H
presume O
? O

Yes O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
a O
licensed O
contractor H
. O

Okay O
. O

Um O
, O
the O
job N
was O
out H
at O
UCSB O
, O
I H
went O
and O
estimated O
the O
job N
for O
myself H
, O
to O
see O
if O
I H
could O
take O
the O
job N
, O
for O
what O
he O
wanted O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
, O
and O
I H
let O
him O
know O
that O
I H
could O
not O
. O

Do O
the O
job N
. O

I H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
make O
any O
money N
. O

So O
uh O
, O
upon O
me H
telling O
him O
that O
, O
he O
offered O
to O
pay O
my H
employees H
, O
fill O
out H
— O
he O
had O
em O
fill O
out H
W2 O
forms N
all O
of O
em O
, O
and O
he O
paid O
em O
, O
to O
lessen O
the O
burden N
of O
payment N
on O
me H
, O
so O
that O
I H
in O
turn O
would O
make O
more O
money N
off O
the O
job N
. O

I H
agreed O
to O
that O
, O
after O
about O
— O

Ca- O
is O
that O
a O
normal O
procedure N
? O

Not O
at O
all O
. O

He O
wanted O
me H
to O
do O
the O
job N
, O
so O
he O
offered O
to O
take O
some O
of O
the O
monetary O
burden N
off O
my H
back O
, O
so O
that O
I H
could O
do O
it O
for O
the O
agreed O
amounts N
that O
we H
were O
gonna O
gon O
na O
do O
it O
on O
. O

So O
in O
other O
words N
, O
your H
— O
your H
helpers H
would O
really O
be O
his O
employees H
for O
the O
purpose N
of O
this O
job N
. O

That's O
That O
's H
correct O
. O

He O
had O
em O
all O
fill O
out H
the O
plo- O
proper O
forms N
. O

So O
then O
your H
costs O
would O
be O
reduced O
there O
as O
far O
as O
— O

That's O
That O
's H
correct O
. O

Alright O
. O

Uh O
, O
I H
went O
to O
receive O
my H
check O
, O
of O
which O
, O
we H
had O
agreed O
that O
he O
would O
deduct O
the O
amount N
of O
the O
hourly O
wage N
, O
that O
he O
was O
— O

Was O
this O
agreement N
in O
writing N
, O
or O
verbal O
? O

Completely O
verbal O
. O

I've O
I H
've O
been O
working O
with O
him O
for O
like O
six O
years N
. O

Uh O
, O
upon O
a O
reve- O
uh O
— O
uh O
receiving O
my H
check O
, O
uh O
, O
for O
about O
two O
and O
a O
half O
weeks N
of O
work N
, O
approximately O
between O
fifty O
and O
seventy O
hours N
, O
I H
was O
paid O
three O
- O
hundred O
and O
sixteen O
dollars N
and O
fifty O
- O
one N
cents N
. O

So O
I H
approached O
him O
with O
it O
, O
and O
he O
handed O
me H
this O
yellow O
piece N
of O
paper N
here O
, O
and O
noted O
that O
, O
what O
the O
employees H
made O
, O
and O
uh O
, O
at O
twenty O
- O
six O
percent N
less O
deduction N
on O
these O
two O
employees H
. O

Which O
was O
the O
employer H
contribution N
. O

So O
I H
noted O
to O
him O
that O
he O
was O
supposed O
to O
pay O
that O
, O
he O
said O
, O
uh O
n- O
, O
no O
, O
you're H
you H
're O
gonna O
gon O
na O
pay O
it O
. O

So O
I H
said O
that's O
that O
's H
not O
as O
per O
our H
agreement N
, O
he O
said O
yes O
it O
is O
, O
he O
handed O
me H
my H
check O
, O
rolled O
up O
his O
window N
, O
and O
drove O
off O
. O

And O
he's O
he O
's H
there O
to O
state N
, O
he's O
he O
's H
— O
he O
saw O
that O
, O
and O
was O
witness N
to O
that O
. O

I H
have O
a O
letter N
— O

I H
do O
n- O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
think O
it's O
it O
's H
relevant O
that O
he O
rolled O
up O
his O
window N
and O
drove O
off O
. O

Well O
, O
I H
know O
. O

But O
, O
that O
– O
that O
was O
the O
end N
of O
our H
thing N
, O
I H
tried O
to O
contact O
him O
everything O
, O
finally O
I H
uh O
contacted O
my H
attorney H
. O

I'd O
I H
'd O
like O
to O
present N
this O
letter N
to O
you H
here O
. O

Okay O
. O

If O
I H
may O
look O
at O
that O
? O

And O
, O
have O
you H
shown O
that O
to O
uh O
Mr. N
Collins H
? O

Yes O
, O
please O
. O

Yes O
. O

He O
has O
— O
he O
has O
received O
a O
copy N
of O
that O
letter N
. O

Now O
Stu O
Roberts H
is O
an O
attorney H
. O

Is O
that O
correct O
? O

Yes O
sir H
. O

You're O
You H
're O
uh O
— O

I'm O
I H
'm O
his O
nephew H
. O

You're O
You H
're O
his O
nephew H
. O

And O
you're H
you H
're O
Nick H
Ro- O
Roberts' O
Roberts H
' O
nephew H
too O
then O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
correct O
. O

Okay O
. O

So O
uh O
your H
uncle H
then O
wrote O
uh O
Builders H
uh O
a O
letter N
, O
that's O
that O
's H
what O
I'm O
I H
'm O
reading O
now O
. O

Yes O
sir H
. O

Uh O
I H
do O
emphasize O
that O
I'm O
I H
'm O
reading O
it O
, O
this O
is O
not O
evidence N
, O
this O
is O
only O
y- O
your H
story N
, O
that O
you've O
you H
've O
told O
Mr. N
Roberts H
. O

That's O
That O
's H
correct O
, O
that's O
that O
's H
correct O
. O

Okay O
. O

So O
really O
the O
dispute N
then O
boils O
down O
to O
this O
twenty O
- O
six O
percent N
. O

That's O
That O
's H
it O
sir H
. O

Okay O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
the O
reason N
why O
I H
had O
him O
fill O
out H
that O
portion N
of O
, O
or O
he O
wanted O
to O
write O
those O
checks N
, O
was O
so O
I H
would O
save O
that O
money N
, O
so O
I H
would O
do O
that O
job N
. O

Okay O
. O

At O
the O
end N
of O
the O
job N
. O

Mr. N
Collins H
I H
know O
you're H
you H
're O
biting O
at O
the O
bit N
there O
, O
you H
wanna O
wan O
na O
say O
something O
, O
so O
why O
don't O
do O
n't O
you H
go O
ahead O
. O

Okay O
thank O
you H
your H
honor N
. O

Um O
, O
uh O
pretty O
much O
, O
um O
, O
what O
Mitchell H
has O
stated O
is O
untrue O
. O

Mitchell H
, O
uh O
did O
do O
some O
work N
for O
me H
out H
at O
the O
college N
, O
we H
did O
the O
Anacapa O
Residential O
Hall H
. O

And O
this O
is O
a O
, O
eight O
- O
thousand O
- O
yard N
job N
, O
that O
we H
did O
this O
summer N
. O

It O
required O
us H
to O
, O
employ O
, O
oh O
five O
or O
six O
crews N
, O
uh O
Mitchell H
Roberts H
was O
one N
of O
them O
that O
we H
used O
, O
on O
the O
job N
. O

Uh O
Mitchell H
expressed O
a O
desire N
to O
do O
the O
work N
out H
there O
, O
he O
expressed O
, O
he O
did O
not O
know O
how O
to O
handle N
the O
payroll N
. O

Most O
of O
the O
, O
uh O
, O
contractors H
here O
in O
town N
, O
that O
are O
independents H
like O
Mitchell H
, O
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
do O
prevailing O
wage N
statements N
. O

The O
college N
is O
a O
state N
- O
funded O
uh O
uh O
remodel O
, O
and O
on O
state N
- O
funded O
remodels O
, O
we're O
we H
're O
required O
to O
pay O
prevailing O
wages N
. O

Uh O
prevailing O
wages N
, O
that O
, O
um O
, O
that O
indicate O
different O
levels N
of O
agility N
, O
of O
the O
different O
men H
working O
. O

And O
so O
, O
uh O
a O
lot N
of O
the O
crews N
, O
uh O
, O
like O
Mitchell H
, O
who O
have O
people N
that O
work N
under O
him O
, O
around O
town N
, O
in O
regular O
situations N
, O
come O
to O
the O
people N
like O
me H
, O
and O
ask O
us H
to O
do O
payroll N
for O
them O
. O

When O
we H
do O
the O
payroll N
for O
them O
, O
we H
state N
to O
them O
up O
front N
, O
that O
uh O
, O
we H
will O
pay O
the O
payroll N
, O
we H
will O
make O
the O
deductions N
, O
and O
then O
the O
employer H
contribution N
, O
which O
is O
approximately O
twenty O
- O
six O
percent N
, O
over O
and O
above O
the O
hourly O
wage N
, O
is O
also O
deducted O
, O
from O
the O
um O
subcontractor's O
subcontractor H
's H
check O
. O

Now O
this O
uh O
th- O
twenty O
- O
six O
percent N
, O
that'd O
that O
'd O
be O
be O
social O
security N
. O

And O
what O
else O
would O
it O
include O
? O

Um O
— O

Sorta O
like O
, O
um O
— O

That's O
That O
's H
anything O
above O
that O
. O

Well O
you H
have O
— O
you H
have O
— O
you H
have O
that O
— O
I H
have O
a O
breakdown N
here O
, O
of O
what O
we H
paid O
Mitchell's O
Mitchell H
's H
men H
, O
if O
you'd O
you H
'd O
like O
to O
see O
that O
. O

Okay O
. O

I H
mean O
, O
do O
— O
yeah O
, O
y- O
you H
got O
a O
total N
of O
uh O
, O
seven O
point N
six O
five O
percent N
employer H
contributions N
on O
the O
— O

Um O
, O
that O
explains O
it O
pretty O
well O
, O
there's O
there O
's H
quite O
a O
few O
deductions N
, O
of O
course N
— O

Oh O
and O
and O
the O
oh O
the O
— O
the O
f- O
the O
annual O
unemployment N
insurance N
, O
and O
uh O
— O

Right O
. O

Okay O
. O

Worker's O
Worker H
's H
compensation N
. O

Right O
. O

So O
Erasmus O
laid O
the O
the O
— O
laid O
the O
egg A
, O
which O
Luther H
hatched O
. O

And O
um O
, O
when O
you H
come O
then O
, O
to O
, O
uh O
, O
however O
this O
debate N
. O

This O
freedom N
of O
the O
will O
. O

Um O
, O
I H
think O
uh O
, O
let O
me H
read O
you H
a O
page N
from O
Brendler O
. O

Because O
it O
sets N
the O
sa- O
stage N
very O
nicely O
. O

This O
is O
in O
the O
Luther H
book O
some O
of O
you H
are O
reading O
, O
and O
um O
, O
if O
you H
, O
this O
evening N
when O
you H
go O
home N
, O
if O
you H
wanna O
wan O
na O
meditate O
it O
on O
more O
, O
on O
– O
on O
it O
more O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
on O
page N
three O
eleven O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
on O
page N
three O
eleven O
. O

But O
, O
let O
me H
just O
read O
you H
the O
– O
, O
cause N
this O
gives O
us H
the O
setting N
very O
nicely O
, O
and O
then O
we H
can O
uh O
, O
Erasmus O
entitled O
his O
anti-Luther O
pamphlet N
, O
Diatribe O
Concerning O
Free O
Will H
. O

Once O
again O
, O
the O
first O
and O
fundamental O
questions N
, O
disputed O
in O
fifteen O
sixteen O
, O
and O
fifteen O
seventeen O
, O
and O
disputed O
again O
in O
Heidelberg O
, O
in O
April O
of O
fifteen O
eighteen O
, O
with O
which O
Luther H
had O
opened O
the O
assault N
on O
scholastic O
theology N
, O
were O
debated O
. O

Luther H
was O
glad O
to O
take O
up O
the O
theme N
of O
this O
debate N
. O

And O
this O
is O
what O
Luther H
writes O
to O
Erasmus O
. O

You H
alone O
, O
among O
all O
the O
others O
, O
have O
recognized O
the O
key N
question N
. O

And O
you H
do O
not O
bore O
me H
, O
with O
the O
Papacy O
, O
purgatory N
, O
indulgences N
, O
and O
similar O
nonsense N
. O

You H
, O
and O
you H
alone O
, O
have O
identified O
that O
on O
which O
all O
else O
hinges O
. O

And O
you H
have O
put O
the O
razor N
to O
the O
throat N
. O

And O
for O
that O
I H
thank O
you H
heartily O
. O

Um O
, O
thus O
Luther H
evalu- O
uh O
evaluated O
the O
subject O
. O

And O
Erasmus O
commented O
on O
the O
significance N
of O
their O
engagement N
, O
in O
battle N
, O
in O
his O
own O
style N
. O

And O
he O
wrote O
to O
Luther H
. O

Perhaps O
an O
Erasmus O
who O
writes O
against O
you H
, O
will O
do O
more O
for O
the O
Gospel O
, O
than O
certain O
dunderheads H
who O
support N
you H
. O

And O
then O
, O
humanistic O
thinking O
, O
will O
never O
consent N
. O

This O
is O
Brendler O
now O
, O
obs- O
– O
uh O
on O
this O
uh O
, O
but O
this O
sets N
the O
stage N
for O
what O
we're O
we H
're O
gonna O
gon O
na O
talk O
about O
. O

Humanistic O
thinking O
will O
never O
consent N
to O
the O
doctrine N
of O
original O
sin N
. O

Pico O
de O
la O
Mirandela O
would O
not O
have O
consented O
to O
the O
doctrine N
of O
original O
sin N
. O

The O
author H
of O
uh O
, O
what O
is O
it O
, O
Houseman O
I H
think O
, O
of O
Invictus O
. O

I H
am O
the O
master O
of O
my H
fate N
, O

I H
am O
the O
captain H
of O
my H
soul N
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
he O
would O
acknowledge O
original O
sin N
. O

Is O
based O
uh O
, O
alright O
, O
what O
is O
it O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
based O
, O
as O
it O
is O
, O
on O
the O
concept N
, O
that O
human O
nature N
is O
totally O
depraved O
, O
and O
of O
itself O
not O
capable O
of O
any O
good O
will O
. O

And O
that O
apart O
from O
grace N
alone O
, O
free O
will O
is O
nothing N
, O
can O
do O
nothing N
, O
does O
nothing N
, O
except O
depraved O
deeds N
. O

Even O
though O
these O
pronouncements N
are O
Biblically O
based O
, O
and O
may O
be O
acceptable O
within O
an O
exclusively O
theological O
system N
, O
they O
do O
not O
appear O
reconcilable O
with O
the O
dignity N
of O
man- O
– O
dignity N
of O
man H
. O

Catholic H
, O
and O
semi-pelagianism O
, O
with O
all O
of O
its O
emphasis N
on O
on O
the O
role N
of O
prevenient O
grace N
, O
finally O
views N
free O
will O
as O
the O
decisive O
factor N
in O
attaining O
salvation N
, O
thereby O
conceptualizing O
free O
will O
, O
as O
similar O
to O
a O
healthy O
man- O
– O
healthy O
human O
understanding N
. O

For O
how O
can O
a O
person H
, O
be O
responsible O
for O
his O
deeds N
, O
if O
he O
possesses O
no O
free O
will O
? O

This O
is O
what O
Erasmus O
asked O
. O

How O
can O
he O
decide O
between O
good O
and O
evil O
? O

So O
reasoned O
Erasmus O
. O

Such O
arguments N
, O
long O
known O
to O
Luther H
, O
and O
many O
times N
presented O
to O
him O
, O
impressed O
him O
not O
in O
the O
least O
. O

God H
alone O
is O
salvation N
. O

God H
alone O
measures N
guilt N
. O

He O
alone O
condemns O
. O

He O
alone O
grants O
grace N
. O

Justifies O
and O
saves O
. O

When O
he O
will O
, O
and O
whom O
he O
will O
. O

Man H
can O
do O
nothing N
against O
the O
divine O
prerogative N
. O

Man H
can O
only O
accept O
the O
divine O
judgment N
. O

This O
is O
in O
fact N
best O
. O

And O
if O
by O
— O
and O
— O
and O
it O
is O
by O
the O
divine O
prerogative N
, O
that O
man H
will O
— O
uh O
, O
that O
man H
is O
well O
provided O
for O
. O

For O
God H
alone O
is O
infallible O
, O
and O
his O
being O
is O
grace N
and O
mercy N
. O

This O
concept N
, O
that O
man H
is O
divinely O
elected O
to O
salvation N
, O
or O
to O
damnation N
, O
is O
the O
center N
of O
the O
predestination N
dogma N
, O
that O
later O
, O
the O
Geneva O
reformer H
Calvin H
, O
made O
the O
center N
of O
his O
teaching O
, O
and O
that O
subsequently O
, O
under O
other O
historical O
preconditions N
and O
circumstances N
, O
could O
be O
linked O
closely O
with O
a O
prosperous O
middle O
class N
, O
in O
the O
Netherlands O
, O
and O
in O
England O
. O

Um O
, O
uh O
, O
skip O
this O
paragraph N
. O

This O
is O
the O
paragraph N
though O

Right O
here O
, O
the O
next O

p- O

Therefore O
, O
Luther H
did O
not O
accept O
rational O
arguments N
against O
predestination N
doctrine N
. O

Such O
arguments N
, O
on O
the O
contrary N
, O
necessarily O
appeared O
to O
Luther H
, O
given O
his O
theological O
orientation N
, O
as O
suspicious O
, O
from O
the O
very O
start O
, O
because O
they O
originated O
from O
human O
nature N
, O
which O
exalted O
itself O
against O
God H
. O

The O
whore H
reason N
prefers O
to O
submit O
to O
the O
Devil H
, O
adjusts O
to O
all O
situations N
, O
and O
proves O
everything O
, O
that O
is O
demanded O
of O
her O
. O

Human A
nature N
, O
does O
not O
possess O
free O
will O
. O

It O
is O
like O
a O
horse A
, O
ridden O
by O
God H
or O
the O
Devil H
. O

The O
rider H
possesses O
the O
will O
. O

The O
horse A
obeys O
. O

Well O
that's O
that O
's H
as O
clear N
as O
you H
can O
get O
it O
. O

Human A
nature N
is O
like O
a O
horse A
, O
ridden O
by O
God H
or O
the O
Devil H
. O

The O
rider H
possesses O
free O

. O

The O
horse A
obeys O
. O

Alright O
that O
, O
th- O
now O
the O
debate N
is O
joined O
you H
see O
. O

And O
as O
you H
come O
— O
as O
Erasmus O
comes O
to O
this O
, O
he's O
he O
's H
going O
to O
say O
, O
well O
let's O
let O
's H
look O
at O
the O
Scriptures O
. O

Now O
, O
number N
one N
, O
we H
have O
to O
admit O
first O
– O
v- O
first O
off O
, O
that O
there O
seem O
to O
be O
passages N
, O
there O
are O
passages N
in O
the O
Scriptures O
. O

Are O
there O
not O
? O

Many O
. O

Which O
seem O
to O
teach O
, O
that O
man H
is O
responsible O
for O
his O
deeds N
, O
and O
that O
he O
may O
act N
, O
and O
has O
a O
free O
will O
to O
respond O
to O
the O
invitation N
of O
God H
. O

Isn't O
Is O
n't O
that O
clear N
in O
the O
Scriptures O
? O

Whosoever O
will O
may O
come O
. O

Um O
, O
Jesus H
turned O
to O
his O
disciples H
, O
you H
remember O
, O
when O
some O
deserted O
him O
, O
and O
seemed O
, O
because O
they O
were O
disappointed O
in O
some O
of O
his O
sayings N
, O
and O
they O
were O
offended O
by O
some O
of O
the O
things N
he O
said O
, O
and O
they O
walked O
no O
longer O
with O
him O
it O
said O
. O

And O
then O
he O
turned O
to O
those O
who O
remained O
, O
and O
he O
said O
, O
will O
ye H
also O
go O
away O
? O

They O
had O
a O
choice N
. O

Didn't O
Did O
n't O
they O
? O

Will H
you H
go O
away O
? O

What O
do O
you H
will O
? O

And O
the O
will O
, O
apparently O
was O
, O
re- O
resided O
in O
in O
these O
disciples H
. O

And O
so O
Erasmus O
is O
going O
to O
say O
, O
so O
obviously O
, O
in O
Scripture O
we H
have O
paradox N
. O

We H
have O
clear N
passages N
of O
Scripture O
, O
which O
seem O
to O
indicate O
that O
man H
has O
a O
free O
will O
, O
and O
that O
he O
can O
exercise N
that O
will O
, O
to O
follow O
, O
or O
not O
to O
follow O
. O

To O
respond O
or O
not O
to O
respond O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand N
, O
we H
have O
passages N
of O
Scripture O
, O
which O
seem O
to O
indicate O
, O
that O
the O
will O
is O
not O
free O
, O
and O
that O
the O
– O
, O
and O
that O
man H
i- O
th- O
is O
– O
man H
is O
predestined O
by O
a O
an O
omnipotent O
sovereign O
will O
of O
God H
. O

Yeah O
. O

Do O
they O
have O
any O
kids H
? O

Hm-m O
. O

Have O
they O
been O
married O
a O
long O
time N
? O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
think O
Kathy H
can O
have O
kids H
, O
she's O
she O
's H
got O
a O
bad O
back O
. O

It O
sounds N
bad O
to O
me H
. O

She O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
– O
she O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
carry O
Laura H
. O

She O
had O
to O
be O
– O
Laura H
– O
She O
could O
hold O
her O
. O

As O
long O
as O
she O
didn't O
did O
n't O
get O
up O
. O

Really O
? O

Yeah O
sh- O
she O
weighed O
all O
of O
ten O
pounds N
you H
know O
. O

She's O
She O
's H
all O
, O
heavy O
. O

She O
could O
– O

Well O
, O
maybe O
she O
does O
have O
quite O
a O
problem N
. O

M-mm O
. O

Some O
people N
d- O
could O
. O

I H
suppose O
. O

I H
mean O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
impossible O
. O

Yeah O
. O

But O
– O

Tend O
to O
believe O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
as O
bad O
as O
sh- O
th- O
– O

How O
long O
have O
they O
been O
married O
? O

Um O
, O
Year O
and O
a O
half O
? O

I H
think O
, O
and O
, O
two O
years N
in O
November O
. O

Mm O
. O

What's O
What O
's H
Bill H
doing O
now O
? O

Hm O
. O

What O
are O
we H
in O
the O
process N
of O
? O

Your H
Bill H
. O

Not O
Bill H
Wilson H
. O

My H
Bill H
? O

Um O
, O
yesterday N
he O
was O
a O
carpenter H
. O

Your H
– O

He O
was O
a O
carpenter H
? O

Yeah O
he O
put O
a O
floor N
in O
a O
barn N
. O

Oh O
really O
? O

He O
put O
a O
floor N
in O
a O
barn N
. O

Well O
, O
he O
just O
fixed O
it O
, O
it O
had O
had O
one N
, O
and O
he O
was O
just O
replacing O
old O
rotten O
board N
. O

Oh O
. O

And O
stuff N
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
he's O
he O
's H
doing O
today N
. O

He O
was O
supposed O
to O
start O
baling O
hay N
, O
but O
I H
think O
they're O
they O
're O
gonna O
gon O
na O
let O
it O
sit O
another O
day N
, O
cause N
he O
didn't O
did O
n't O
take O
his O
lunch N
. O

What O
does O
he O
do O
when O
he O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
take O
his O
lunch N
, O
come O
home N
? O

No O
Doris H
feeds O
him O
. O

Eats O
there O
. O

Hm O
. O

Would O
she O
feed O
him O
every O
day N
? O

Now O
explain O
all O
of O
this O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
understand O
what O
not O
taking O
his O
lunch N
has O
to O
do O
with O
baling O
hay N
. O

Well O
if O
he O
was O
gonna O
gon O
na O
bale O
hay N
, O
they O
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
come O
in O
for O
lunch N
. O

They O
would O
just O
eat O
– O

While O
they're O
they O
're O
out H
there O
. O

Out O
there O
. O

Out O
in O
the O
field N
. O

I H
see O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Okay O
. O

If O
he O
didn't O
did O
n't O
take O
his O
lunch N
every O
day N
, O
would O
she O
feed O
him O
every O
day N
? O

Yeah O
, O
she O
does O
. O

Feed N
him O
. O

I H
mean O
– O
well O
, O
when O
they're O
they O
're O
in O
the O
field N
, O
he O
has O
to O
take O
his O
lunch N
. O

That's O
That O
's H
just O
part N
of O
the O
deal O
. O

But O
– O

Otherwise O
he'll O
he O
'll O
starve O
. O

Right O
? O

No O
, O
otherwise O
he O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
get O
lunch N
. O

Well O
I H
know O
, O
that's O
that O
's H
what O
starving O
is O
. O

Actually O
, O
I H
think O
that O
if O
she O
found O
out H
he O
come O
and O
didn't O
did O
n't O
have O
a O
lunch N
, O
she'd O
she O
'd O
fix O
him O
one N
. O

Mm O
. O

Cause O
that's O
that O
's H
what O
she O
does O
with O
other O
people N
. O

Mm O
. O

But O
all O
winter N
she O
fixes O
him O
lunch N
. O

Oh O
, O
cause N
they're O
they O
're O
always O
close O
enough O
to O
– O

Actually O
it's O
it O
's H
more O
of O
a O
dinner N
, O
because O
it's O
it O
's H
– O

No O
lemon N
. O

I H
will O
go O
get O
you H
another O
one N
. O

N- O
that's O
that O
's H
alright O
. O

She O
just O
remembered O
. O

No O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
okay O
. O

Soon O
as O
I H
sat O
it O
down O
– O
sat O
it O
down O
I H
thought O
, O
no O
lemon N
. O

knew O
it O
. O

Just O
– O

It O
– O

There O
's H
not O
enough O
lemon N
there O

bother O
me H
. O

Thank O

. O

Okay O
. O

But O

tastes O
so O
good O
with O
lemon N
in O
it O
. O

tea N
. O

Like O
" O

news N
" O
. O

So O
then O
I H
said O
, O
" O
but O
look O
at O
Barb O
, O

she O
's H
healthy O
now O
" O
, O
and O
Carolyn H
looked O
at O
her O
, O
and O
sort N
of O
looked O
away O
, O
and O
I H
thought O
, O
oh O
boy H
. O

Rude O
. O

Way O
to O
go O
Carolyn H
. O

He's O
He O
's H
teething O
. O

You H
should O
have O
heard O
him O
, O
the O
night N
we H
took O
him O
to O
the O
emergency N
room N
. O

He O
sounded O
worse O
. O

I H
pr- O
if O
I H
know O
, O
I H
would O
probably've O
probably O
've O
been O
totally O
freaked O
out H
. O

That's O
That O
's H
scary O
. O

Maybe O
it's O
it O
's H
good O
he O
didn't O
did O
n't O
stay O
with O
me H
. O

I'd O
I H
'd O
have O
been O
like O
Michael H
. O

Scary O
. O

Yeah O
, O
he O
– O
he O
was O
um O
– O

I'd O
I H
'd O
be O
like O
Mom H
, O
uh O
, O
what O
should O
we H
do O
with O
this O
child H
. O

Well O
his O
temperature N
was O
a O
hundred O
and O
four O
point N
five O
. O

That O
is O
so O
high O
. O

He's O
He O
's H
lucky O
that O
he O
didn't O
did O
n't O
– O

How O
long O
was O
he O
there O
? O

That O
high O
? O

How O
long O
, O
do O
you H
know O
? O

Uh O
his O
fever N
? O

Yeah O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
dangerou- O
– O
I H
mean O
s- O
– O

Cause O
he O
could O
have O
, O
brain N
damage N
. O

The O
doctor H
said O
– O
the O
doctor H
said O
that O
th- O
um O
, O
his O
pediatrician H
, O
cause N
I H
asked O
him O
about O
it O
, O
and O
he O
said O
that O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
hospitalize O
until O
they O
go O
up O
to O
like O
a O
hundred O
and O
seven O
. O

And O
that's O
that O
's H
where O
it's O
it O
's H
fatal O
. O

And O
I H
was O
like O
, O
well O
, O
you H
know O
– O

What O
about O
brain N
damage N
? O

That O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
matter N
or O
? O

Mmm O
. O

Excuse O
me H
brain N
damage N
is O
important O
to O
me H
. O

He O
said O
actually O
fevers N
are O
– O

How O
did O
he O
explain O
it O
? O

He O
said O
something O
like O
, O
feathers N
– O
fevers N
are O
like O
, O
um O
, O
good O
for O
babies H
like O
, O
when O
they're O
they O
're O
i- O
b- O
getting O
sick O
, O
because O
they O
help O
the O
immune H
system N
fight N
harder O
. O

Somehow O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Well O
that's O
that O
's H
what O
the O
– O
I H
mean O
that's O
that O
's H
what O
– O

The O
reason N
the O
body N
gets O
that O
hot O
, O
is O
like O
to O
kill O
the O
germs N
or O
whatever O
I H
think O
. O

Isn't O
Is O
n't O
that O
part N
of O
it O
? O

Yes O
Doctor H
Kevin H
, O
tell O
. O

No O
I'm O
I H
'm O
pretty O
– O
I'm O
I H
'm O
pretty O
sure O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
pretty O
sure O
that's O
that O
's H
part N
of O
it O
, O
but O
uh O
it's O
it O
's H
just O
that O
you H
have O
to O
watch O
out H
, O
cause N
then O
, O
if O
it O
gets O
too O
hot O
it's O
it O
's H
bad O
for O
the O
brain N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
like O
a O
car N
, O
it O
overheats O
. O

And O
stalls O
out H
. O

Maybe O
, O
I H
don't O
do O

two O
different O
ways N
. O

Like O
, O
kids H
can O
either O
like O
, O
they'll O
they O
'll O
say O
one N
word N
, O
but O
they'll O
they O
'll O
say O
it O
really O
, O
like O
pretty O
clear N
, O
and O
that O
the O
way N
they're O
they O
're O
th- O
they'll O
they O
'll O
have O
like O
twenty O
words N
or O
whatever O
, O
and O
they'll O
they O
'll O
just O
ask O
for O
one N
thing N

And O
then O
there's O
there O

other O
kids H
who O
go O
, O
na-na-na-na-za-ba-da O
? O

And O
there'll O

And O
there's O
there O
's H
a O
– O

Oh O

Don't O
Do O

freak O

Are O

Michael H

Michael's O
Michael H

was O
all O
wet O
, O
from O
right O
here O
, O
from O
him O
just O
drooling O
. O

It O
was O
– O

Probably O
he O
was O
opening N
– O

And O
we H
took O
him O
to O
the O
– O

Breathing O
through O
his O
mouth N
more O
, O
cause N
he O
couldn't O
could O
n't O

funny O

Child H
, O
you're H
you H
're O
having O
problems N
. O

You H
know O
, O
I H
remember O
, O
m O
– O
back O
in O
the O
psychedelic O
days N
, O
there O
was O
this O
poster N
of O
the O
scientist H
. O

I've O
I H
've O
always O
been O
on O
a O
, O
kind N
of O
a O
crusade N
, O
for O
scientific O
uh O
, O
responsibility N
. O

Right O
? O

And O
scientists H
are O
, O
are O
taking O
such O
control N
over O
the O
world N
these O
days N
, O
uh O
with O
their O
n- O
, O
you H
know O
, O
not O
the O
scientists H
, O
but O
what O
they've O
they O
've O
invented O
. O

And O
the O
way N
it's O
it O
's H
marketed O
, O
and O
the O
way N
we're O
we H
're O
d- O
— O
we H
develop O
needs N
for O
it O
. O

And O
I H
remember O
this O
pf- O
cartoon N
I H
saw O
w- O
, O
of O
, O
of O
, O
it O
was O
called O
The O
Scientist O
. O

And O
it O
had O
this O
, O
this O
wonderful O
stone N
statue N
, O
about O
twenty O
stories N
tall O
, O
of O
a O
naked O
man H
, O
and O
a O
naked O
woman H
, O
intertwined O
with O
each O
other O
, O
hugging O
each O
other O
, O
full O
frontal O
, O
and O
their O
arms N
wrapped O
around O
each O
other O
, O
and O
then O
they O
s- O
— O
they O
– O
they O
looked O
like O
they O
were O
so O
intertwined O
, O
and O
they O
spiraled O
down O
and O
, O
and O
they're O
they O
're O
a O
s- O
— O
they're O
they O
're O
a O
statue N
. O

Right O
. O

Hm O
. O

Made O
out H
of O
stone N
. O

And O
they're O
they O
're O
and O
the O
whole O
base N
of O
the O
statue N
is O
crumbling O
. O

Right O
? O

And O
it's O
it O
's H
just O
like O
rubble N
, O
f- O
like O
from O
, O
just O
below O
the O
knees N
, O
down O
, O
was O
just O
kind N
of O
rubble N
. O

But O
the O
rest N
of O
it O
was O
all O
real O
clear N
, O
a O
few O
ottle- O
— O
some O
of O
it O
was O
chipped O
off O
, O
you H
know O
, O
it O
was O
old O
but O
, O
and O
d- O
— O
and O
down O
at O
the O
bottom N
, O
of O
this O
, O
this O
rubble N
, O
was O
this O
little O
man H
who O
was O
a O
scientist H
. O

And O
he O
had O
this O
big O
magnifying O
glass N
. O

And O
he O
was O
looking O
at O
the O
rubble N
. O

Looking O
with O
his O
head N
down O
. O

Hm O
. O

Not O
looking O
up O
at O
the O
statue N
, O
and O
seeing O
the O
love O
, O
and O
the O
the O
– O
the O
– O
symbol N
there O
, O
but O
looking O
down O
at O
the O
crumbs N
, O
you H
know O
. O

Hm O
. O

At O
the O
rubble N
at O
the O
bottom N
. O

With O
his O
magnifying O
glass N
. O

And O
, O
and O
, O
to O
me H
that O
, O
that O
always O
symbolized O
, O
kind N
of O
rather O
clearly O
, O
the O
limitations N
of O
the O
scientific O
method N
. O

Well O
. O

Whi- O
— O
if O
it O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
take O
into O
account O
the O
to- O
— O
the O
the O
the O
whole O
human O
experience N
, O
and O
, O
including O
, O
the O
unbelievable O
parts N
of O
it O
. O

The O
parts N
that O
are O
just O
legend N
. O

And O
myth N
. O

And O
, O
and O
uh O
, O
alluded O
to O
. O

You H
mean O
the O
theories N
. O

And O
, O
and O
the O
psychedelic O
experiences N
, O
and O
the O
subjective O
. O

Oh O
, O
on O
that O
side N
. O

You H
know O
, O
and O
insanity N
, O
and O
, O
what O
, O
I H
mean O
. O

Well O
. O

You H
know O
they O
— O
they've O
they O
've O
got O
to O
take O
ac- O
into O
account O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
East O
, O
with O
all O
its O
, O
with O
all O
its O
fantastic O
discoveries N
. O

But O
, O
you H
can't O
ca O
n't O
— O
but O
you H
can't O
ca O
n't O
look O
at O
the O
stars N
with O
a O
microscope N
. O

And O
science N
is O
a O
microscope N
. O

Each O
p- O
scientist H
has O
their O
, O
their O
field N
of O
um O
, O
expertise N
, O
and O
if O
they're O
they O
're O
gonna O
gon O
na O
go O
, O
if O
they're O
they O
're O
gonna O
gon O
na O
stretch O
out H
far O
enough O
into O
the O
— O
the O
unknown O
where O
they O
can O
find O
something O
new O
, O
they O
have O
to O
do O
it O
in O
a O
straight O
line N
. O

They O
can't O
ca O
n't O
do O
it O
in O
all O
directions N
at O
once O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
true O
. O

Because O
then O
you H
run O
into O
things N
that O
we H
already O
know O
. O

So O
the O
problem N
is O
communication N
between O
s- O
— O

But O
they're O
they O
're O
doing O
it O
, O
they're O
they O
're O
doing O
it O
with O
mathematics N
. O

Right O
? O

I H
mean O
. O

Well O
. O

N- O
no O
. O

But O
the O
comm- O
, O
problem N
is O
, O
communication N
between O
the O
branches N
of O
science N
. O

Mhm O
. O

I H
think O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
true O
. O

Cause O
, O
who's O
who O
's H
gonna O
gon O
na O
be O
able O
to O
hold O
, O
all O
that O
knowledge N
, O
and O
make O
the O
connections N
? O

Well O
, O
the O
philosophers H
, O
and O
the O
spiritual O
leaders H
, O
and O
, O
I H
mean O
, O
cause N
, O
f- O
the O
stuff N
can O
be O
understand O
, O
understood O
. O

The O
goals N
. O

Those O
people N
can O
tell O
you H
. O

Or O
the O
, O
or O
the O
cutting N
— O
cutting N
edge N
, O
can O
be O
understand O
— O
understood O
intellectually O
. O

But O
those O
people N
can't O
ca O
n't O
tell O
you H
the O
details N
. O

They O
know O
the O
whole O
structure N
, O
but O
see O
. O

Well O
the O
— O

It's O
It O
's H
like O
both O
sides N
. O

You H
have O
to O
have O
somebody H
looking O
at O
the O
details N
. O

Ya H
got O
to O
have O
a O
leader H
. O

And O
somebody H
looking O
at O
the O
— O

And O
you H
got O
to O
have O
, O
a O
bunch N
of O
workers H
. O

You H
know O
? O

Yeah O
. O

And O
you H
gotta O
got O
ta O
have O
somebody H
. O

Right O
. O

Who O
d- O
isn't O
is O
n't O
necessarily O
inclined O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
details N
that O
much O
, O
who's O
who O
's H
guiding O
, O
those O
who O
are O
willing O
to O
sit O
there O
. O

I H
guess O
that's O
that O
's H
the O
problem N
. O

And O
make O
all O
the O
— O

We H
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
guider O
. O

Yeah O
. O

There's O
There O
's H
no O
l- O
, O
there's O
there O
's H
no O
lead O
, O
or O
there's O
there O
's H
no O
focus O
. O

Yeah O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
right O
. O

And O
— O
and O
uh O
, O
you H
know O
, O
I H
think O
, O
I H
think O
that O
, O
one N
of O
the O
reasons N
that O
there's O
there O
's H
been O
no O
focus O
is O
because O
, O
oh O
, O
everybody O
accepted O
the O
scientific O
method N
as O
the O
best O
tool N
that O
we H
have O
, O
and O
was O
kinda O
letting O
the O
scientific O
method N
be O
the O
— O
be O
the O
leader H
. O

Mhm O
. O

The O
— O
the O
– O
w- O
you H
know O
, O
just O
continue O
inventorying O
and O
— O

Well O
those O
people N
who O
are O
doing O
research N
. O

Continue O
inventorying O
, O
cataloging O
, O
experimenting O
. O

You H
know O
, O
documenting O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
whatever O
. O

And O
, O
instead O
of O
, O
instead O
of O
uh O
, O
uh O
coming O
at O
it O
from O
another O
direction N
. O

Trying O
to O
find O
, O
trying O
to O
find O
, O
uh O
, O
trying O
to O
find O
ways N
to O
, O
to O
, O
like O
with O
with O
Einstein H
for O
example N
, O
you H
know O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
me H
, O
he O
was O
trying O
to O
f- O
— O
t- O
he O
was O
exper- O
experimenting O
with O
, O
with O
new O
ways N
of O
doing O
things N
, O
you H
know O
. O

Well O
thinking O
about O
things N
. O

Oh O
— O
uh O
and O
thinking O
about O
things N
, O
and O
he O
was O
trying O
to O
— O
he O
w- O
— O
I H
think O
he O
was O
ultimately O
trying O
to O
, O
trying O
to O
discover O
the O
speed N
of O
his O
own O
thought O
. O

Hm O
. O

You H
know O
, O
I H
mean O
, O
he O
was O
like O
, O
really O
off O
into O
wonderful O
abstract O
notions N
, O
that O
were O
all O
based O
in O
a O
peaceful O
world N
. O

You H
know O
? O

That O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
exist O
unless O
he O
was O
secure O
that O
we H
had O
a O
peaceful O
world N
or O
that O
that O
peace N
was O
part N
of O
it O
. O

Of O
what O
he O
was O
about O
. O

And O
, O
so O
much O
of O
today's O
today N
's H
technology N
is O
soulless O
and O
has O
nothing N
to O
do O
with O
peace N
. O

It O
has O
to O
do O
with O
, O
just O
generally O
, O
chewing O
up O
, O
you H
know O
, O
consumerism N
basically O
and O
— O
. O

Mhm O
. O

Chewing O
up O
— O
ch- O
n- O
— O
j- O
– O
chewing O
up O
new O
w- O
— O
uh O
, O
chewing O
up O
the O
human O
experience N
, O
and O
turning O
it O
into O
, O
some O
kind N
of O
consumer H
need O
. O

Okay O
, O
so O
a O
recheck O
would O
be O
about O
that O
much O
with O
the O
x O
- O
rays N
, O
and O
then O
— O

Mhm O
. O

Does O
that O
sound N
right O
? O

Thirty O
- O
two O
— O

I H
think O
if O
we H
— O
she O
woke O
up O
, O
we H
could O
w- O
send O
her O
home N
tonight N
. O

I H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
see O
why O
we H
couldn't O
could O
n't O
send O
her O
home N
tonight N
, O
would O
you H
? O

If O
she O
wakes O
up O
, O
fine O
. O

Oh O
well O
, O
we're O
we H
're O
gonna O
gon O
na O
be O
Biotaling O
her O
and O
oh O
— O

Sh- O
if O
she O
— O
she O
probably O
won't O
wo O
n't O
though O
. O

Never O
mind N
. O

Never O
mind N
. O

I H
was O
thinking O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
still O
thinking O
— O

Jeez O
. O

Na O
. O

Na O
na O
, O
na O
na O
na O
. O

And O
she O
won't O
wo O
n't O
have O
any O
an- O
antibiotics N
, O
cause N
there's O
there O
's H
no O
break O
. O

No O
. O

And O
that O
— O

Thirty O
- O
two O
. O

What O
is O
this O
? O

Ten O
, O
for O
anesthesia N
. O

Oh O
. O

But O
, O
they're O
they O
're O
opposite N
. O

They're O
They O
're O
still O
opposite N
. O

Yeah O
, O
that O
looks O
alright O
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
you H
think O
we H
should O
charge O
them O
an O
extra O
eighteen O
? O

For O
the O
distemper N
vaccine N
? O

Trent H
does O
it O
. O

No O
. O

I H
felt N
horrible O
doing O
that O
on O
that O
eye N
dog A
that O
he O
had O
in O
here O
last O
week N
, O
under O
whatever O
night N
it O
was O
. O

Cause O
he O
had O
down O
twenty O
- O
five O
plus O
eighteen O
, O
and O
what O
can O
you H
do O
, O
when O
he's O
he O
's H
already O
got O
it O
down O
? O

Jeez O
. O

Well O
, O
well O
, O
all O
we H
did O
— O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
do O
that O
, O
cause N
all O
we H
did O
was O
, O
I H
was O
in O
here O
and O
put O
a O
bandage N
on O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Um O
, O
did O
you H
get O
hold O
of O
Dan H
then O
? O

Yeah O
. O

Let's O
Let O
's H
see O
. O

Six O
, O
fifty O
- O
six O
. O

Let O
me H
see O
, O
let O
me H
see O
. O

We H
need O
one N
of O
these O
and O
one N
of O
these O
, O
one N
of O
those O
, O
and O
one N
of O
those O
, O
and O
two O
of O
those O
. O

Three O
, O
fifty O
- O
three O
. O

Sent O
home N
with O
Amoxi O
, O
and O
Pred O
, O
so O
, O
we'll O
we H
'll O
see O
how O
— O

Yeah O
. O

Well O
, O
I'll O
I H
'll O
call O
him O
probably O
late O
this O
afternoon N
, O
to O
make O
sure O
he's O
he O
's H
alright O
. O

Calculator N
? O

No O
, O
I H
was O
just O
trying O
to O
figure O
out H
what O
we H
spent O
already O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
. O

Let's O
Let O
's H
see O
, O
we've O
we H
've O
already O
spent O
fifty O
for O
him O
, O
and O
I H
want O
him O
to O
spend O
another O
hundred O
. O

Well O
— O

But O
that's O
that O
's H
better O
than O
pins N
, O
and O
surgery N
. O

Right O
, O
which O
would O
be O
another O
two O
hundred O
or O
— O

Yeah O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
more O
for O
a O
surgery N
. O

To O
spend O
. O

Any O
— O
pretty O
much O
any O
time N
you H
can O
— O

And O
that O
one N
really O
, O
you H
know O
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
would O
benefit N
from O
pins N
. O

M-m O
. O

Because O
we'd O
we H
'd O
have O
to O
undo O
it O
. O

I H
mean O
we'd O
we H
'd O
have O
to O
, O
well O
, O
we'd O
we H
'd O
have O
to O
go O
— O

We H
could O
— O
we H
could O
try O
it O
closed O
. O

Mhm O
. O

But O
, O
still O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
more O
expensive O
. O

I H
think O
it'll O
it O
'll O
do O
fine O
with O
a O
cast N
, O
especially O
since O
it's O
it O
's H
a O
spiral N
fracture N
. O

And O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
displaced O
. O

And O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
displaced O
. O

Should O
be O
pretty O
stable O
. O

It'll O
It O
'll O
be O
kind N
of O
a O
pain N
getting O
the O
— O
well O
, O
maybe O
not O
, O
getting O
the O
cast N
over O
the O
stifle N
? O

Maybe O
not O
. O

Got O
kinda O
long O
legs N
. O

Well O
, O
as O
long O
as O
she's O
she O
's H
— O
as O
long O
as O
she's O
she O
's H
quiet N
. O

Okay O
, O
I'll O
I H
'll O
give O
him O
a O
call O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
he's O
he O
's H
in O
the O
barn N
, O
from O
home N
. O

In O
back O
in O
from O
the O
barn N
yet O
or O
not O
. O

Well O
— O

Called O
both O
the O
house N
number N
and O
the O
barn N
number N
, O
and O
both O
of O
em O
, O
and O
, O
a O
little O
kid H
answered O
. O

Mm O
, O
yeah O
and O
they're O
they O
're O
little O
little O
kids H
too O
. O

Mhm O
? O

They're O
They O
're O
like O
' O
I'm O
I H
'm O
three O
. O
' O

Yeah O
Carol H
? O

It's O
It O
's H
Marcia H
. O

Hi O
. O

Um O
, O
we H
got O
x O
- O
rays N
done O
already O
, O
and O
, O
I H
was O
gonna O
gon O
na O
let O
you H
know O
what O
, O
what O
was O
going O
on O
. O

Should O
I H
talk O
to O
Richard H
or O
are O
you H
okay O
? O

Okay O
. O

Um O
, O
it O
looks O
like O
she's O
she O
's H
got O
a O
spiral N
fracture N
, O
of O
um O
, O
of O
her O
tibia N
, O
which O
is O
the O
bone N
between O
the O
knee N
and O
the O
hock N
, O
and O
, O
um O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
f- O
it's O
it O
's H
really O
looks O
, O
pretty O
stable O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
not O
displaced O
very O
far O
anyway O
, O
and O
it's O
it O
's H
um O
, O
pretty O
much O
, O
you H
know O
, O
locked O
in O
place N
, O
so O
to O
speak O
. O

Um O
, O
so O
I H
think O
that O
she O
would O
, O
she O
would O
do O
fine O
with O
a O
cast N
. O

Um O
, O
and O
, O
I H
pretty O
much O
got O
an O
estimate N
so O
far O
, O
with O
the O
, O
coming O
in O
yesterday N
, O
and O
the O
x O
- O
rays N
and O
everything O
, O
the O
bill N
was O
about O
fifty O
- O
four O
. O

And O
to O
do O
a O
cast N
, O
um O
, O
with O
the O
anasthesia O
, O
and O
staying O
one N
more O
night N
in O
the O
hospital N
and O
stuff N
, O
and O
then O
the O
casting N
material O
, O
probably O
the O
— O

It's O
It O
's H
gonna O
gon O
na O
be O
about O
a O
hundred O
and O
fifty O
- O
three O
, O
total N
. O

And O
, O
the O
only O
, O
then O
it O
would O
be O
, O
the O
only O
extra O
would O
be O
, O
in O
about O
six O
to O
eight O
weeks N
, O
we'd O
we H
'd O
have O
her O
come O
in O
again O
, O
we H
would O
tranquilize O
her O
, O
and O
take O
the O
X O
- O
rays N
, O
and O
see O
if O
it's O
it O
's H
healed O
, O
enough O
to O
take O
off O
. O

And O
that's O
that O
's H
generally O
about O
thirty O
- O
four O
to O
forty O
, O
somewhere O
in O
there O
. O

Yeah O
. O

You H
know O
, O
a O
pin N
, O
you H
know O
, O
if O
we H
did O
a O
pin N
, O
it's O
it O
's H
probably O
, O
it O
would O
probably O
be O
even O
a O
hundred O
more O
but O
, O
so O
it's O
it O
's H
it's O
it O
's H
that's O
that O
's H
about O
the O
— O
at O
this O
point N
the O
, O
the O
least O
expensive O
alternative O
that O
probably O
will O
work N
for O
her O
. O

Um O
, O
so O
, O
if O
you H
want O
to O
let O
him O
know O
and O
then O
have O
him O
call O
me H
back O
, O
if O
you H
, O
if O
you H
wanna O
wan O
na O
go O
ahead O
and O
do O
it O
. O

Okay O
? O

Lindsey H
? O

You H
wanna O
wan O
na O
put O
this O
kitty A
castration N
down O
? O

Sure O
. O

Alright O
. O

And O
if O
she O
— O
you H
know O
, O
if O
we H
did O
it O
, O
she O
could O
probably O
go O
home N
tomorrow N
. O

Okay O
, O
whenever O
, O
whenever O
you H
get O
a O
chance N
. O

Okay O
, O
thanks N
Carol H
. O

Mhm O
, O
bye O
- O
bye O
. O

Am O
I H
doing O
that O
right O
so O
far O
? O

Mhm O
. O

All O
the O
way N
down O
to O
that O
? O

Mhm O
. O

I H
think O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
think O
I H
am O
. O

Do O
you H
? O

And O
you'd O
you H
'd O
have O
to O
have O
that O
plus O
or O
minus O
. O

What O
? O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
I H
did O
to O
get O
that O
. O

Where O
did O
I H
get O
that O
square N
root N
of O
— O
um O
, O
x O
squared O
? O

Because O
you H
brought O
this O
over O
here O
. O

You H
brought O
three O
over O
here O
, O
divided O
by O
three O
, O
and O
then O
you H
have O
x O
squared O
, O
so O
if O
you H
want O
to O
find O
x O
, O
you H
have O
the O
square N
root N
of O
x O
squared O
. O

I H
guess O
all O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
figure O
out H
is O
, O
what O
the O
square N
root N
of O
negative O
two O
thir O
– O
thi O
– O
two O
thirds N
is O
. O

Would O
that O
be O
, O
i H
square N
root N
two O
thirds N
? O

i H
square N
root N
two O
o N
– O
over O
three O
. O

The O
whole O
thing N
would O
be O
over O
three O
. O

Well O
. O

No O
it O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
be O
. O

Square O
root N
of O
two O
thirds N
, O
yeah O
. O

But O
then O
you H
got O
the O
other O
one N
Nathan H
. O

Oh O
, O
gosh O
, O
hm O
. O

Leah H
. O

on O
the O
floor N
? O

this O
? O

, O
when O
you're H
you H
're O

, O
somebody H
just O
grabbed O
your H
arm N
, O
started O
swinging O
it O
around O
? O

I'd O
I H
'd O
probably O
just O
slap O
em O
. O

X O
squared O
equals O
one N
over O
the O
square N
root N
of O
that O
, O
the O
square N
root N
of O
that O
, O
x O
equals O
the O
square N
root N
of O
one N
. O

She's O
She O
's H
not O
even O
looking O
at O
me H
. O

She's O
She O
's H
just O
looking O
, O
like O
— O

I H
know O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
what O
I'm O
I H
'm O
talking O
about O
. O

So O
, O
would O
that O
one N
be O
, O
square N
root N
of O
one N
half O
? O

Mhm O
. O

It O
would O
? O

Mhm O
. O

Yep O
. O

But O
do O
y' H
all O
have O
to O
do O
that O
, O
um O
, O
you H
have O
to O
like O
, O
have O
it O
where O
you H
do O
that O
, O
there's O
there O
's H
no O
, O
um O
. O

Fraction N
under O
the O
– O

Under O
the O
, O
in O
the O
denominator N
? O

I H
mean O
no O
fraction N
under O
the O
— O

Oh O
yeah O
. O

So O
then O
you H
just O
multiply O
, O
the O
whole O
thing N
by O
the O
square N
root N
of O
two O
, O
and O
you H
get O
the O
square N
root N
of O
two O
over O
two O
. O

Even O
for O
the O
top N
one N
? O

Even O
for O
that O
one N
? O

No O
. O

For O
— O
I'm O
I H
'm O
talking O
about O
for O
this O
one N
. O

Oh O
. O

All O
you H
do O
is O
like O
go O
, O
t- O
two O
over O
one N
. O

You H
have O
the O
square N
root N
of O
one N
. O

Like O
that O
, O
right O
? O

Mhm O
. O

Since O
you H
have O
the O
square N
root N
of O
two O
on O
the O
bottom N
, O
to O
make O
that O
a O
square N
, O
you H
have O
to O
multiply O
by O
the O
square N
root N
of O
two O
. O

And O
then O
you H
get O
two O
, O
and O
you H
multiply O
the O
top N
by O
the O
square N
root N
of O
two O
, O
and O
you H
get O
, O
square N
root N
of O
two O
. O

What O
? O

I H
wanna O
wan O
na O
rewind O
it O
and O
hear O
that O
back O
again O
. O

Cause O
I H
sure O
didn't O
did O
n't O
catch O
it O
the O
first O
time N
. O

You H
got O
the O
two O
, O
and O
you H
take O
the O
square N
root N
of O
two O
, O
and O
you H
get O
the O
negative O
two O
, O
which O
you H
take O
the O
square N
, O
and O
it O
comes O
to O
two O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
sorry O
. O

So O
, O
let's O
let O
's H
talk O
about O
this O
slowly O
, O
as O
I H
write O
this O
down O
, O
as O
you're H
you H
're O
saying O
it O
. O

Alright O
? O

This O
is O
what O
we H
came O
out H
with O
. O

Right O
? O

It's O
It O
's H
— O
But O
put O
it O
as O
the O
square N
root N
of O
one N
, O
over O
the O
square N
root N
of O
two O
. O

Oh O
. O

And O
then O
you H
multiply O
that O
by O
the O
square N
root N
of O
two O
, O
over O
the O
square N
root N
of O
two O
. O

Right O
. O

Uh O
, O
is O
that O
what O
all O
those O
square N
root N
of O
twos N
are O
? O

That's O
That O
's H
what O
I H
was O
try O
— O
That's O
That O
's H
what O
I H
was O
trying O
to O
say O
. O

Okay O
, O
I H
was O
wondering O
where O
all O
that O
, O
square N
root N
two O
, O
square N
root N
two O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
what O
it O
was O
. O

Then O
right O
here O
you'd O
you H
'd O
get O
, O
square N
root N
of O
two O
over O
two O
. O

Mhm O
. O

See O
everything O
was O
square N
root N
two O
, O
over O
two O
, O
and O
two O
, O

Right O
, O
but O
then O
, O
what O
about O
this O
one N
? O

On O
this O
one N
. O

Let O
me H
do O
this O
one N
. O

But O
, O
you H
have O
i H
— O
you H
have O
i H
square N
root N
of O
three O
, O
over O
square N
root N
of O
three O
. O

I H
mean O
z N
— O
i H
square N
root N
of O
two O
over O
three O
— O
square N
root N
of O
three O
. O

I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
even O
say O
it O
right O
. O

Over O
, O
do O
I H
have O
another O
i H
down O
here O
, O
or O
just O
the O
one N
i H
? O

Um O
, O
no O
. O

Just O
one N
. O

Okay O
, O
three O
and O
square N
root N
of O
three O
, O
over O
square N
root N
of O
three O
, O
and O
you H
get O
— O

i H
square N
root N
of O
six O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Over O
three O
. O

Is O
that O
right O
? O

I H
doubt O
it O
. O

I H
really O
do O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
kidding O
. O

You H
can't O
ca O
n't O
— O
You H
can't O
ca O
n't O
multiply O
square N
roots N
like O
that O
, O
can O
you H
? O

Square O
root N
of O
two O
, O
times N
square N
root N
of O
three O
, O
is O
square N
root N
of O
six O
, O
is O
it O
? O

Yeah O
. O

Okay O
. O

Well O
, O
then O
that's O
that O
's H
fine O
. O

Then O
that O
is O
right O
. O

Isn't O
Is O
n't O
that O
c- O
— O
you H
can O
do O
that O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Cause O
that's O
that O
's H
the O
same O
way N
you're H
you H
're O
multiplying O
there O
, O
square N
root N
of O
nine O
, O
that O
— O
and O
square N
root N
of O
nine O
equals O
three O
. O

Yeah O
, O
okay O
. O

Where's O
Where O
's H
the O
test N
? O

There O
ain't O
ai O
n't O
no O
telling O
. O

You H
have O
it O
. O

I H
mean O
I H
have O
it O
. O

Okay O
. O

The O
next O
one N
, O
is O
, O
five O
x O
, O
times N
x O
minus O
one N
. O

Is O
that O
it O
? O

Um O
. O

Equals O
, O
two O
, O
times N
one N
minus O
x O
. O

Leah H
. O

Two O
times N
one N
minus O
x O
? O

Yeah O
. O

And O
that's O
that O
's H
easy O
, O
you H
can O
do O
that O
. O

Oh O
this O
is O
easy O
. O

X O
squared O
. O

Please O
say O
this O
will O
factor N
. O

Will H
it O
? O

Nah O
, O
you H
do O
it O
. O

Well O
, O
I H
mean O
, O
that's O
that O
's H
just O
wasting O
time N
. O

Cause O
if O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
. O

Yeah O
. O

It O
does O
? O

Mhm O
. O

One O
and O
negative O
two O
- O
fifths N
? O

Mhm O
. O

And O
I H
can O
always O
put O
those O
back O
up O
into O
the O
top N
and O
, O
and O
see O
if O
they O
check O
. O

Right O
? O

Let O
me H
just O
try O
the O
one N
? O

Five O
, O
I H
got O
zero O
equals O
zero O
. O

Tha- O
– O
that's O
that O
's H
right O
. O

And O
that's O
that O
's H
one N
? O

Yeah O
. O

Zero O
equals O
zero O
equals O
one N
. O

Okay O
. O

The O
Last O
Christmas O
of O
Mrs. O
Claus O

by O
Alex H
Wilson H

Betty H
was O
thirty O
- O
eight O
and O
still O
believed O
in O
Santa H
Claus O
. O

But O
sometimes O
he O
could O
be O
such O
an O
asshole H
. O

She O
leaned O
against O
the O
kitchen N
counter N
, O
picking O
dried O
glaze N
from O
the O
wrinkles N
in O
the O
back O
of O
her O
hand N
. O

From O
the O
wireless O
headset N
that O
dangled O
from O
her O
neck N
, O
her O
old O
marine O
buddies H
called O
to O
her O
with O
joyous O
profanity N
and O
the O
bass N
of O
digital O
gunfire N
. O

The O
Xbox O
was O
upstairs O
. O

Her O
buddies H
were O
in O
San O
Diego O
and O
Cleveland O
. O

Satellite N
coverage N
in O
Santa’s O
Santa H
’s H
Village O
was O
just O
another O
Christmas O
miracle N
, O
like O
faster O
- O
than O
- O
light N
travel O
and O
stuffing O
oneself O
through O
gas N
fireplaces N
with O
neither O
explosions N
nor O
lawsuits N
nipping O
at O
your H
heels N
. O

It O
was O
six O
o’clock O
. O

Santa H
had O
said O
he O
needed O
to O
leave O
at O
eight O
. O

So O
Betty H
had O
made O
Christmas O
Eve H
dinner N
while O
listening O
to O
— O
instead O
of O
participating O
in O
— O
the O
big O
special O
ops O
campaign N
game N
online O
. O

She’d O
She O
’d O
garlic A
- O
salted O
the O
yams N
to O
the O
tune N
of O
Gomez H
unloading O
his O
Glock O
into O
a O
drug N
dealer H
. O

She’d O
She O
’d O
painted O
the O
ham O
with O
maple N
glaze N
while O
Williams H
punctuated O
Patty H
Smyth’s O
Smyth O
’s H
“ O
Goodbye N
to O
You H
” O
with O
bursts N
from O
his O
assault N
rifle N
. O

“ O
Her O
boys H
, O
” O
as O
she O
called O
them O
, O
didn’t O
did O
n’t O
take O
a O
lot N
of O
eggnog N
in O
their O
rum N
. O

Santa H
had O
spent O
his O
day N
opening N
envelopes N
from O
North H
American O
children H
and O
falling O
asleep O
watching O
the O
Pittsburgh O
- O
Cleveland O
game N
in O
the O
media N
room N
. O

Now O
he O
was O
in O
the O
kitchen N
, O
awake O
and O
on O
his O
way N
out H
the O
door N
, O
because O
suddenly O
spending N
fifteen O
minutes N
eating O
dinner N
with O
his O
wife H
had O
become O
too O
much O
of O
a O
burden N
on O
this O
most O
wonderful O
night N
of O
the O
year N
. O

His O
white O
V N
- O
neck N
undershirt N
was O
tucked O
into O
his O
pants N
in O
front N
, O
pulled O
taught O
over O
his O
belly N
. O

It O
stretched O
the O
neckhole O
halfway O
down O
to O
his O
happy O
trail N
. O

His O
hands N
were O
finding O
their O
way N
through O
the O
armholes N
of O
his O
robe N
. O

“ O
It’s O
It O
’s H
just O
that O
there O
are O
more O
children H
in O
the O
world N
now O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O

“ O
And O
Santa’s O
Santa H
’s H
not O
getting O
any O
younger O
, O
ho O
ho O
ho O
. O
” O

“ O
Don’t O
Do O
n’t O
get O
much O
older O
either O
, O
” O
Betty H
said O
. O

Santa’s O
Santa H
’s H
first O
wife H
had O
died O
centuries N
ago O
, O
but O
he O
always O
just O
dismissed O
the O
question N
of O
his O
own O
mortality N
. O

Betty H
never O
knew O
how O
naughty O
she O
should O
feel O
about O
wanting O
to O
strangle O
him O
sometimes O
. O

“ O
You’re O
You H
’re O
seriously O
going O
to O
let O
me H
eat O
alone O
again O
on O
Christmas O
Eve H
? O
” O

“ O
Don’t O
Do O
n’t O
think O
of O
it O
like O
that O
, O
doll N
, O
” O
Santa H
said O
. O

“ O
Think O
of O
the O
children H
. O
” O

He O
slung O
his O
belt N
around O
his O
back O
, O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
quick O
tug N
. O

His O
waist N
shrunk O
from O
dangerously O
obese O
to O
barely O
jolly O
. O

A H
few O
crumpled O
bills N
in O
American O
currency N
fell O
out H
of O
his O
pocket N
. O

Santa H
bent O
down O
to O
pick O
them O
up O
, O
mumbling O
about O
“ O
emergency N
money N
. O
” O

“ O
Can’t O
Ca O
n’t O
you H
get O
dressed O
in O
the O
bedroom N
like O
a O
normal O
person H
? O
” O
Betty H
asked O
. O

Distorted O
shouting N
erupted O
from O
Betty’s O
Betty H
’s H
headset N
. O

She O
imagined O
red O
and O
yellow O
mosaic N
bursts N
lighting N
up O
the O
sunless O
snowscape O
outside O
, O
as O
if O
there O
was O
an O
HDTV N
behind O
the O
blinds N
instead O
of O
their O
kitchen N
window N
. O

One O
of O
her O
boys H
probably O
stepped O
on O
a O
landmine O
. O

Williams H
, O
she O
guessed O
. O

She O
thought O
she O
could O
hear O
Gomez H
laughing O
. O

She O
picked O
up O
the O
pans N
in O
which O
she’d O
she O
’d O
made O
the O
potatoes N
and O
maple N
glaze N
. O

She O
put O
them O
in O
the O
sink N
to O
soak O
. O

The O
gingerbread N
batter N
bowl N
could O
wait N
a O
day N
, O
even O
though O
it O
would O
take O
longer O
to O
clean O
tomorrow N
. O

For O
now O
, O
she O
appreciated O
its O
fight N
to O
cover O
the O
ham O
- O
stink N
that O
coated O
the O
room N
. O

The O
jingle N
bell N
chimed O
on O
Santa’s O
Santa H
’s H
cell N
. O

“ O
Nutcrackers N
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O

“ O
Santa H
can’t O
ca O
n’t O
reach O
it O
, O
and O
it’s O
it O
’s H
probably O
Ginny O
. O

Would O
you H
be O
a O
doll N
? O
” O

“ O
Your H
secretary’s O
secretary H
’s H
calling O
, O
and O
you H
need O
me H
to O
answer N
it O
? O

How O
efficient O
. O
” O

Betty H
wiped O
her O
fingers N
on O
a O
hand N
- O
towel N
. O

She O
lifted O
her O
headset’s O
headset N
’s H
microphone N
to O
her O
mouth N
. O

“ O
Moroz O
out H
. O

Back N
in O
five O
. O
” O

“ O
Copy O
that O
, O
” O
Gomez H
said O
on O
the O
other O
end N
. O

“ O
It’ll O
It O
’ll O
take O
that O
long O
to O
put O
Humpty O
back O
together O
again O
anyway O
. O
” O

Betty H
switched O
off O
her O
headset N
mic O
. O

She O
unclipped O
the O
cell N
phone N
from O
the O
back O
of O
Santa’s O
Santa H
’s H
girdle N
, O
and O
pushed O
the O
button N
with O
the O
green O
arrow N
, O
serrated O
to O
look O
like O
a O
double O
- O
edged O
diving N
knife N
. O

Or O
a O
Christmas O
tree A
, O
if O
that O
was O
more O
your H
thing N
. O

“ O
Hey O
Ginny O
, O
” O
Betty H
said O
into O
the O
phone N
. O

“ O
Oh O
hello O
, O
Mrs. O
Claus H
, O
” O
Ginny O
said O
. O

“ O
Merry O
Christmas O
. O
” O

“ O
For O
heaven’s O
heaven N
’s H
sake N
, O
call O
me H
Betty H
. O
” O

“ O
Sorry O
, O
Mrs. O
Claus H
. O

Has O
Mr. N
Claus H
left O
yet O
? O
” O

“ O
On O
his O
way N
, O
” O
Betty H
said O
. O

“ O
He O
was O
just O
thinking O
of O
the O
children H
. O

One O
at O
a O
time N
. O

He’s O
He O
’s H
very O
thorough O
. O
” O

“ O
How O
wonderful O
! O
” O

When O
Tyler H
was O
very O
young O
, O
his O
grandmother H
was O
his O
favorite O
person H
in O
the O
world N
because O
, O
unlike O
his O
parents H
, O
who O
believed O
that O
children H
should O
always O
be O
told O
the O
truth N
as O
adults H
understood O
it O
, O
she O
would O
fill O
in O
the O
gaps N
in O
his O
knowledge N
— O
Santa H
Claus H
, O
the O
Easter O
Bunny H
, O
God H
. O

His O
parents H
were O
always O
too O
busy O
and O
often O
a O
little O
too O
serious O
, O
but O
his O
grandmother H
had O
a O
sense N
of O
peace N
about O
her O
, O
a O
lightness N
that O
lifted O
his O
spirit N
. O

A H
few O
times N
, O
when O
Tyler’s O
Tyler H
’s H
parents H
were O
away O
, O
she O
took O
him O
with O
her O
to O
church N
. O

He O
remembered O
liking O
the O
singing O
and O
the O
colorful O
windows N
, O
and O
how O
safe O
he O
felt N
there O
, O
in O
that O
large O
, O
empty O
space N
, O
sitting O
on O
a O
hard O
bench N
next O
to O
her O
warmth N
. O

When O
she O
died O
, O
grief N
overwhelmed O
Tyler H
. O

But O
like O
most O
adults H
, O
when O
he O
grew O
older O
he O
could O
only O
recall O
the O
intensity N
of O
that O
love O
in O
childhood N
in O
an O
abstract O
way N
. O

He O
made O
the O
common O
error N
of O
identifying O
maturity N
with O
worth N
, O
and O
assumed O
that O
the O
love O
he O
had O
for O
her O
as O
a O
young O
child H
must O
have O
been O
lacking O
in O
strength N
and O
depth N
. O

For O
many O
years N
after O
her O
death N
, O
however O
, O
Tyler H
was O
tortured O
by O
the O
memory N
of O
a O
certain O
visit O
from O
her O
. O

He O
was O
five O
or O
so O
, O
and O
they O
were O
playing O
some O
board N
game N
at O
the O
kitchen N
table N
. O

As O
he O
swung O
his O
legs N
in O
his O
excitement N
, O
he O
kicked O
her O
repeatedly O
in O
the O
shins N
. O

She O
asked O
him O
to O
stop N
, O
and O
he O
refused O
, O
giggling O
. O

When O
she O
finally O
frowned O
at O
him O
and O
threatened O
to O
stop N
playing O
if O
he O
didn’t O
did O
n’t O
stop N
he O
told O
her O
to O
go O
to O
Hell O
. O

In O
Tyler’s O
Tyler H
’s H
mind N
he O
could O
see O
her O
face N
grow O
taut O
, O
lose O
color N
, O
and O
then O
, O
for O
the O
only O
time N
he O
could O
remember O
, O
she O
began O
to O
cry N
. O

He O
also O
remembered O
his O
own O
utter O
confusion N
. O

His O
parents H
did O
not O
have O
much O
use H
for O
religion N
and O
so O
for O
him O
Hell O
was O
a O
word N
without O
much O
mystery N
or O
power N
. O

At O
that O
time N
he O
knew O
only O
vaguely O
that O
Hell O
was O
a O
place N
you H
did O
not O
want O
to O
go O
, O
like O
the O
dark O
basement N
or O
the O
even O
darker O
attic N
. O

He O
remembered O
feeling O
resentful O
that O
she O
was O
crying O
and O
he O
did O
not O
even O
understand O
why O
. O

Tyler H
felt N
the O
guilt N
of O
this O
memory N
even O
in O
his O
teenage O
years N
. O

For O
him O
it O
summed O
up O
all O
his O
insecurities N
and O
fears N
about O
his O
own O
cruelty N
, O
ignorance N
, O
and O
the O
possibility N
that O
he O
was O
, O
in O
reality N
, O
not O
a O
good O
person H
. O

The O
fact N
that O
he O
had O
caused O
someone H
who O
loved O
him O
such O
pain N
with O
so O
little O
effort N
and O
understanding N
troubled O
him O
deeply O
. O

One O
day N
Tyler H
looked O
through O
an O
old O
family H
photo N
album N
, O
and O
in O
it O
was O
a O
picture N
of O
the O
kitchen N
in O
the O
house N
they O
used O
to O
live O
in O
. O

He O
was O
surprised O
to O
discover O
that O
the O
small O
kitchen N
contained O
a O
central O
island N
, O
and O
had O
no O
space N
for O
the O
table N
in O
his O
memory N
at O
all O
. O

With O
the O
discovery N
of O
that O
single O
error N
in O
his O
memory N
came O
a O
cascade N
of O
other O
revelations N
. O

Now O
he O
remembered O
that O
they O
always O
ate O
in O
the O
dining N
room N
, O
and O
when O
they O
did O
play O
board N
games N
, O
it O
was O
always O
on O
the O
coffee N
table N
in O
the O
living O
room N
. O

The O
memory N
that O
had O
caused O
him O
such O
pain N
over O
the O
years N
could O
not O
possibly O
have O
occurred O
. O

Somehow O
, O
he O
must O
have O
manufactured O
the O
whole O
scene N
in O
his O
imagination N
. O

It O
was O
not O
very O
hard O
to O
explain O
what O
really O
happened O
, O
he O
thought O
. O

The O
death N
of O
his O
grandmother H
had O
probably O
caused O
in O
him O
feelings N
of O
abandonment N
and O
guilt N
. O

In O
his O
confusion N
he O
had O
taken O
elements N
from O
storybooks N
and O
imagined O
out H
of O
nothing N
this O
memory N
to O
punish O
himself O
. O

This O
was O
the O
sort N
of O
fantasy N
that O
could O
have O
occurred O
to O
any O
young O
child H
who O
lost O
an O
important O
relative O
. O

With O
that O
realization N
, O
the O
image N
of O
his O
grandmother H
crying O
faded O
in O
his O
memory N
and O
became O
less O
and O
less O
believable O
. O

Tyler H
thought O
he O
was O
very O
lucky O
to O
have O
discovered O
the O
single O
error N
in O
his O
false O
memory N
, O
which O
enabled O
him O
to O
reason N
his O
way N
into O
distinguishing O
between O
reality N
and O
fantasy N
. O

He O
felt N
that O
it O
was O
a O
coming O
- O
of O
- O
age N
moment N
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
he O
admitted O
to O
himself O
that O
he O
was O
a O
little O
sad O
also O
at O
the O
discovery N
. O

For O
however O
imaginary O
that O
memory N
was O
, O
it O
was O
also O
a O
part N
of O
his O
love O
for O
his O
grandmother H
. O

When O
that O
memory N
lost O
its O
compelling O
aura N
of O
truth N
, O
it O
was O
like O
another O
part N
of O
her O
died O
with O
it O
. O

He O
had O
no O
name N
for O
the O
emptiness N
that O
remained O
. O

Everyone’s O
Everyone O
’s H
just O
watching O
the O
weird O
retarded O
girl H
except O
this O
one N
chubby O
guy H
who’s O
who O
’s H
trying O
to O
get O
her O
to O
put O
down O
the O
lights N
but O
who’s O
who O
’s H
afraid O
to O
touch O
her O
. O

“ O
Not O
supposed O
to O
touch O
those O
, O
” O
he O
says O
. O

“ O
Where’s O
Where O
’s H
your H
mom H
? O

Is O
your H
mom H
here O
? O
” O

“ O
Sorry O
! O
” O
I H
say O
. O

The O
chubby O
guy H
frowns O
at O
me H
. O

“ O
Cara H
, O
” O
I H
say O
. O

“ O

” O

Cara H
looks O
at O

, O

at O
the O
lights N
. O

I H
gently O
try O
to O
take O

. O

“ O

” O
she O
wails O
. O

“ O

“ O

“ O

developmentally O
delayed O

Cara H

No O

” O

She O
wails O
, O
but O
lets O
me H
disentangle O
her O
hands N
. O

“ O
I’m O
I H
’m O
sorry O
, O
” O
I H
say O
again O
, O
the O
concerned O
big O
brother H
. O

“ O
I H
was O
just O
looking O
around O
and O
thought O
she O
was O
right O
with O

, O
you H
know O
? O

Our H
mom’s O
mom H
’s H
down O
at O
Dillard’s O
Dillard O
’s H
. O
” O

Chubby O
guy H
kind N
of O
hovers O
until O
I H
get O
the O
lights N
away O
from O
Cara H
and O
as O
soon O
as O
I H
put O
them O
on O
the O
shelf N
he O
grabs O
them O
and O
starts O
straightening O
them O
out H
and O
draping O
them O
back O
over O
the O
display O
. O

I H
herd O
Cara H
towards O
the O
front N
of O
the O
store N
, O
mouthing O
sorry O
at O
the O
front N
cashier H
. O

She’s O
She O
’s H
kind N
of O
pretty O
. O

She O
smiles O
at O
me H
. O

Nice O
big O
brother H
with O
retarded O
sister H
. O

Back N
out H
in O
the O
mall N
, O
Cara H
is O
wailing O
, O
which O
could O
start O
an O
asthma N
attack N
, O
so O
to O
distract O
her O
I H
say O
, O
“ O
You H
want O
a O
cookie N
? O
” O

Mom H
has O
Cara H
on O
a O
diet N
, O
so O
of O
course N
she O
wants O
a O
cookie N
. O

She O
perks N
up O
the O
way N
Shelby H
, O
our H
Shetland O
Sheepdog O
does O
, O
when O
you H
say O
‘ O
treat O
. O
’ O

I H
take O
her O
to O
the O
food N
court N
and O
buy O
her O
an O
M&M O
cookie N
and O
buy O
myself H
a O
Mountain O
Dew O
and O
then O
while O
she’s O
she O
’s H
eating O
her O
cookie N
, O
I H
pull O
the O
deck N
of O
cards N
out H
of O
my H
pocket N
and O
unwrap O
it O
. O

We’ve O
We H
’ve O
got O
another O
fifteen O
minutes N
before O
we H
have O
to O
meet O
my H
mom H
. O

The O
idea N
is O
to O
play O
fish A
except O
every O
time N
you H
get O
a O
match O
you’re O
you H
’re O
supposed O
to O
do O
what O
it O
says O
. O

Tie O
partner’s O
partner H

hands N
with O
a O
silk N
scarf N
. O

Kiss O
anywhere O
you H
like O
and O
see O
how O
long O
your H
partner H
can O
keep O
from O
moving O
or O
making O
any O
noise N
. O

The O
one N
who O
lasts O
the O
longest O
gets O
to O
draw O
an O
extra O
card N
. O

Tame O
, O
but O

but O
she O
lets O

her O
face N
off O
. O

“ O
You H
ready O
to O
go O
back O
to O
see O
Mom H
? O
” O
I H
say O
. O

When O
we H
pass O
Spencer’s O
Spencer H
’s H
again O
, O
she O
stops N
. O

“ O
Uhhh O
, O
” O
she O
says O
, O
pointing O
to O
the O
store N
. O

Mom H
always O
tries O
to O
get O
her O
to O
say O
what O
she O
wants O
, O
but O
I H
know O
what O
she O
wants O
and O
I H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
want O
to O
fight N
with O
her O
. O

“ O
No O

I H

“ O

” O

Cara’s O
Cara H

“ O

“ O
It’s O
It O

” O
I H
say O

“ O
Come O

” O

She O
swings N
at O
me H
. O

I H
grab O
her O
hand N
and O
pull O
her O
behind O
me H
. O

She O
tries O
to O
sit O
down O
, O
but O
I H
just O
keep O
on O
tugging O
and O
she O
follows O
me H
, O
gulping O
and O
wailing O
. O

“ O
What O
did O
you H
do O
? O
” O
my H
mom H
says O
when O
she O
sees O
us H
. O

My H
mom H
had O
to O
buy O
stuff N
, O
like O
gym N
shorts N
for O
me H
and O
underwear N
for O
herself O
, O
so O
I H
told O
her O
that O
I’d O
I H
’d O
take O
Cara H
with O
me H
while O
she O
bought O
her O
stuff N
. O

She’s O
She O
’s H
holding O
a O
Dillard’s O
Dillard O
’s H
bag N
. O

“ O
She O
wanted O
to O
go O
in O
Spencer’s O
Spencer H
’s H
, O
” O
I H
say O
. O

“ O
We H
went O
in O
but O
she O
kept O
grabbing O
stuff N
and O
I H
had O
to O
take O
her O
out H
and O
now O
she’s O
she O
’s H
upset O
. O
” O

“ O
Robert H
, O
” O
my H
mom H
says O
, O
irritated O
. O

She O
crouches O
down O
. O

“ O
Ah O
, O
Cara H
mia O
, O
don’t O
do O
n’t O
cry N
. O
” O

We H
trail N
out H
of O
the O
store N
, O
Cara H
holding O
Mom’s O
Mom H
’s H
hand N
and O
sniffling O
. O

By O
the O
time N
we H
get O
to O
the O
car N
, O
though O
, O
Cara’s O
Cara H
’s H
wheezing O
. O

Mom H
digs O
out H
Cara’s O
Cara H
’s H
inhaler N
and O
Cara H
dutifully O
takes O
a O
hit O
. O

I H
tried O
it O
once O
and O
it O
was O
pretty O
dreadful O
. O

It O
felt N
really O
weird O
, O
trying O
to O
get O
that O
stuff N
in O
my H
lungs N
, O
and O
it O
made O
me H
feel O
a O
little O
buzzy O
but O
it O
didn’t O
did O
n’t O
even O
feel O
good O
, O
so O
it’s O
it O
’s H
pretty O
amazing O
that O
Cara H
will O
do O
it O
. O

Cara H
sits O
in O
her O
booster H
seat N
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
car N
, O
wheezing O
all O
the O
way N
home N
, O
getting O
worse O
and O
worse O
, O
and O
by O
the O
time N
we H
pull O
in O
the O
driveway N
, O
she’s O
she O
’s H
got O
that O
white O
look O
around O
her O
mouth N
. O

“ O
Robert H
, O
” O
Mom H
says O
, O

“ O
I’m O
I H
’m O
going O
to O
have O
to O
take O
her O
to O
the O
Emergency N
Room N

” O

“ O
Okay O
, O
” O
I H
say O
and O
get O
out H
of O
the O
car N
. O

“ O
You H
want O
to O
call O
your H
dad H
? O
” O
Mom H
asks O
. O

“ O
I H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
know O
how O
long O
we’ll O
we H
’ll O
be O
. O
” O

Mom H
checks N
her O
watch O
. O

It’s O
It O
’s H
three O
something O
now O
. O

“ O
We H
may O
not O
be O
home N
in O
time N
for O
dinner N
. O
” O

I H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
want O
to O
call O
my H
dad H
who O
is O
probably O
with O
Joyce H
, O
his O
girlfriend H
, O
anyway O
. O

Joyce H
is O
always O
trying O
to O
be O
likable O
and O
it O
gets O
on O
my H
nerves N
after O
a O
while O
— O
she O
tries O
way N
too O
hard O
. O

“ O
I H
can O
just O
make O
a O
sandwich N
, O
” O
I H
say O
. O

“ O
I H
want O
you H
to O
stay O
at O
home N
, O
then O
, O
” O
she O
says O
. O

“ O
I’ve O
I H
’ve O
got O
my H
cell N
phone N
if O
you H
need O
to O
call O
. O
” O

“ O
Can O
Toph O
and O
Len H
come O
over O
? O
” O
I H
ask O
. O

She O
sighs O
. O

“ O
Okay O
. O

But O
no O
roughhousing O
. O

Remember O
you H
have O
school N
tomorrow N
. O
” O

She O
opens O
the O
garage N
door N
so O
I H
can O
get O
in O
. O

I H
stand O
there O
and O
watch O
her O
back O
down O
the O
driveway N
. O

She O
turns N
back O
, O
watching O
where O
she’s O
she O
’s H
going O
, O
and O
she O
needs N
to O
get O
her O
hair N
done O
again O
because O
I H
can O
really O
see O
the O
gray O
roots N
. O

Cara H
is O
watching O
me H
through O
the O
watery O
glass N
, O
her O
mouth N
a O
little O
open O
. O

I H
wave N
good O
- O
bye O
. O

I’m O
I H
’m O
glad O
they’re O
they O
’re O
gone O
. O

The O
day N
it O
rained O
in O
the O
garden N

The O
first O
drops O
of O
rain N
fell O
onto O
the O
parched O
stones N
from O
a O
cloudless O
blue O
sky O
. O

They O
disappeared O
immediately O
, O
drunk O
down O
into O
the O
mineral N
silence N
. O

The O
garden N
paused O
, O
and O
everything O
held O
its O
breath N
and O
waited O
. O

More O
rain N
would O
come O
. O

Everyone O
knew O
, O
beyond O
belief N
or O
necessity N
that O
the O
time N
had O
come O
. O

And O
with O
it O
, O
the O
rain N
. O

Heavy O
oily O
drops O
bounced O
from O
leaf N
to O
grass A
to O
dusty O
ground N
, O
gathering N
in O
stems N
and O
folds N
on O
the O
way N
. O

Yet O
still O
the O
sky O
was O
a O
hard O
polished O
blue O
with O
not O
a O
cloud N
in O
sight N
. O

Still O
the O
garden N
held O
its O
breath N
. O

It O
would O
not O
be O
long O
now O
. O

A H
spattering N
of O
drops O
plucked O
memories N
from O
deep O
in O
the O
roots N
, O
shivering O
through O
shoots N
and O
tendrils N
, O
humus N
and O
stone N
. O

Wispy O
vapour N
trails N
marbled O
the O
blue O
surface N
above O
. O

And O
then O
it O
rained O
for O
good O
. O

We H
sat O
on O
the O
porch N
watching O
, O
no O
longer O
daring O
to O
dart O
out H
and O
leap O
around O
in O
the O
downfall N
as O
drops O
turned O
to O
torrents N
and O
the O
staccato O
tapping O
on O
the O
roof N
climaxed O
to O
a O
thunderous O
roar N
. O

Pools N
erupted O
and O
overflowed O
along O
the O
edges N
of O
the O
lawn N
, O
cascading O
around O
the O
raspberry A
canes N
and O
over O
the O
flower A
beds N
. O

Earthworms A
rose O
up O
from O
the O
water N
- O
laden O
earth N
where O
they O
could O
no O
longer O
breath N
and O
wriggled O
and O
struggled O
fro O
air N
on O
the O
surface N
, O
writhing O
and O
swimming O
for O
a O
safe O
haven N
. O

Water N
burst O
over O
the O
barrels N
and O
cans N
standing N
under O
the O
eaves O
and O
gutters N
, O
flooding O
the O
pathways N
, O
carrying O
away O
all O
that O
wasn’t O
was O
n’t O
fixed O
solid N
and O
licking O
at O
the O
stairs N
to O
the O
back O
porch N
before O
climbing N
each O
step O
and O
lapping O
against O
the O
planks N
we H
were O
sitting O
on O
, O
a O
wooden O
raft N
surrounded O
by O
angry O
water N
and O
martial O
beat O
drum O
, O
drum O
, O
drumming O
on O
the O
roof N
above O
. O

We H
slipped O
out H
feet N
over O
the O
sides N
and O
when O
we H
felt N
the O
fish A
, O
some O
as O
big O
as O
logs N
, O
some O
as O
small O
as O
leaves N
, O
nibble O
at O
our H
feet N
, O
we H
leant O
over O
to O
watch O
them O
fraying O
and O
frolicking O
under O
the O
choppy O
surface N
. O

Waves N
lapped O
at O
the O
porch N
, O
washing O
away O
the O
boxes N
, O
and O
bowls N
, O
and O
the O
dog’s O
dog A
’s H
basket N
. O

The O
rocking O
chair N
, O
the O
watering O
can O
, O
boxes N
of O
cuttings N
, O
and O
tied O
- O
up O
newspapers N
, O
all O
floated O
away O
as O
we H
slammed O
the O
kitchen N
door N
shut O
and O
retreated O
to O
the O
front N
room N
we H
gazed O
out H
at O
the O
river N
that O
the O
street N
had O
become O
. O

The O
sky O
was O
pewter O
smeared O
with O
charcoal O
now O
, O
and O
pressed O
down O
hard O
on O
the O
rooftops N
, O
slowly O
dissolving O
everything O
below O
. O

When O
the O
water N
rippled O
into O
the O
hallway N
, O
we H
splashed O
our H
way N
to O
the O
staircase N
and O
then O
up O
as O
it O
nipped O
at O
our H
heels N
. O

Outside O
the O
other O
houses N
were O
rocks N
surrounded O
by O
sea N
with O
mermaids A
swimming O
all O
around O
, O
flapping O
their O
scaly O
tails N
and O
hauling O
themselves O
up O
, O
to O
fall N
backwards O
into O
the O
crest N
of O
the O
oncoming O
waves N
. O

And O
as O
they O
swam O
they O
sang O
, O
their O
voices N
born O
on O
the O
winds N
and O
the O
salt N
and O
the O
rain N
, O
and O
we H
could O
hear O
them O
singing O
, O
He O
is O
coming O
, O
He O
is O
coming O
. O

And O
they O
combed O
their O
long O
hair N
in O
preparation N
. O

We H
waved O
and O
called O
, O
and O
they O
laughed O
and O
played O
, O
tantalising O
, O
their O
seaweed A
locks N
just O
out H
of O
reach O
. O

With O
a O
flick N
of O
the O
tail N
they O
were O
off O
, O
still O
singing O
, O
He O
is O
coming O
, O
He O
is O
coming O
, O
until O
their O
voices N
were O
lost O
in O
the O
noise N
of O
the O
rain N
and O
the O
water N
. O

A H
great O
whiskered O
head N
arose O
, O
then O
a O
belly N
, O
wet O
and O
sleek O
, O
long O
enough O
to O
wrap N
itself O
twice O
around O
the O
world N
. O

“ O
Is O
it O
him O
? O
” O
we H
asked O
each O
other O
, O
nudging O
elbows N
and O
climbing N
onto O
the O
chairs N
. O

We H
pulled O
off O
wet O
socks N
and O
shoes N
, O
letting O
them O
float O
away O
on O
the O
tide N
, O
before O
the O
great O
worm A
turned O
and O
the O
wake O
engulfed O
the O
creaking N
, O
cracking N
house N
. O

We H
clambered O
up O
onto O
the O
roof N
, O
sliding O
on O
the O
tiles N
and O
clinging O
to O
chimney N
stacks N
, O
sheltering O
our H
eyes N
from O
the O
driving O
downpour N
. O

The O
sky O
was O
black O
, O
and O
the O
stormy O
sea N
all O
the O
deepest O
, O
darkest O
blues N
and O
greens N
and O
greys N
and O
flecked O
with O
white O
where O
the O
sea N
- O
horses A
galloped O
. O

The O
waters N
broke O
making O
way N
for O
the O
gnarled O
head N
of O
a O
whale A
, O
spouting O
water N
high O
against O
the O
clouds N
before O
opening N
its O
whiskered O
maw N
and O
in O
a O
looming O
, O
booming O
voice H
called O
: O
He O
is O
coming O
, O
He O
is O
coming O
. O

The O
chimneys N
washed O
away O
, O
so O
we H
scrambled O
onto O
the O
blue O
- O
black O
back O
encrusted O
with O
barnacles A
and O
cockles N
like O
stars N
in O
a O
night N
sky O
and O
held O
on O
tight O
as O
he O
rode O
the O
waves N
, O
dipping O
and O
blowing O
, O
dipping O
and O
blowing O
. O

The O
wind N
and O
the O
rain N
tugged O
at O
our H
hair N
. O

And O
still O
it O
rained O
. O

We H
heard O
a O
fearsome O
creaking N
and O
cracking N
and O
before O
our H
eyes N
a O
great O
patch N
of O
sky O
peeled O
away O
, O
deeping O
down O
in O
the O
troughs N
and O
riding N
the O
crests N
with O
torn O
sails N
set O
against O
the O
wind N
. O

It O
was O
a O
galleon N
with O
masts N
like O
a O
dead O
man’s O
man H
’s H
fingers N
, O
tarred O
timbers N
groaning O
and O
a O
mermaid A
sat O
on O
the O
bow N
as O
he O
ship N
dipped O
and O
passed O
. O

He O
is O
coming O
, O
He O
is O
coming O
, O
she O
sang O
out H
. O

And O
just O
as O
the O
wash O
hit O
us H
, O
prising O
us H
from O
the O
whale’s O
whale A
’s H
speckled O
back O
and O
down O
into O
the O
sea N
, O
someone H
threw O
down O
a O
knotted O
rope N
and O
we H
hung O
on O
for O
dear O
life N
. O

The O
singing O
sailors H
hauled O
us H
aboard O
chanting O
, O
He’s O
He O
’s H
a O
coming O
- O
ha O
! O
He’s O
He O
’s H
a O
coming O
- O
ha O
! O

And O
we H
fell O
onto O
the O
deck N
like O
fish A
bursting O
from O
a O
net O
. O

The O
Captain O
stood O
above O
us H
dressed O
in O
jewels N
and O
finery N
from O
a O
thousand O
pillagings N
. O

The O
Valley N
of O
Giants O

I H
had O
buried O
my H
parents H
in O
their O
gray O
marble N
mausoleum N
at O
the O
heart N
of O
the O
city N
. O

I H
had O
buried O
my H
husband H
in O
a O
lead O
box N
sunk O
into O
the O
mud N
of O
the O
bottom N
of O
the O
river N
, O
where O
all O
the O
riverboatmen O
lie O
. O

And O
after O
the O
war N
, O
I H
had O
buried O
my H
children H
, O
all O
four O
, O
in O
white O
linen N
shrouds N
in O
the O
new O
graveyards N
plowed O
into O
what O
used O
to O
be O
our H
farmland N
: O
all O
the O
land O
stretching O
from O
the O
river N
delta N
to O
the O
hills N
. O

I H
had O
one N
granddaughter H
who O
survived O
the O
war N
. O

I H
saw O
her O
sometimes O
: O
in O
a O
bright O
pink O
dress O
, O
a O
sparkling O
drink N
in O
her O
hand N
, O
on O
the O
arm N
of O
some O
foreign O
officer H
with O
brocade N
on O
his O
shoulders N
, O
at O
the O
edge N
of O
a O
marble N
patio N
. O

She O
never O
looked O
back O
at O
me H
— O
poverty N
and O
failure N
and O
political O
disrepute N
being O
all O
, O
these O
days N
, O
contagious O
and O
synonymous O
. O

The O
young O
were O
mostly O
dead O
, O
and O
the O
old O
men H
had O
been O
taken O
away O
, O
they O
told O
us H
, O
to O
learn O
important O
new O
things N
and O
to O
come O
back O
when O
they O
were O
ready O
to O
contribute O
fully O
. O

So O
it O
was O
a O
city N
of O
grandmothers H
. O

And O
it O
was O
in O
a O
grandmother H
bar N
by O
the O
waterfront N
— O
sipping O
hot O
tea N
with O
rum N
and O
watching O
over O
the O
shoulders N
of O
dockworkers H
playing O
mah O
- O
jongg O
— O
that O
I H
first O
heard O
of O
the O
valley N
of O
giants A
. O

We H
all O
laughed O
at O
the O
idea N
, O
except O
for O
a O
chemist H
with O
a O
crooked O
nose N
and O
rouge N
caked O
in O
the O
creases N
of O
her O
face N
, O
who O
was O
incensed O
. O

“ O
We H
live O
in O
the O
modern O
era N
! O
” O
she O
cried O
. O

“ O
You H
should O
be O
ashamed O
of O
yourself H
! O
" O

The O
traveler H
stood O
up O
from O
the O
table N
. O

She O
was O
bony O
and O
rough O
- O
skinned O
and O
bent O
like O
an O
old O
crow H
, O
with O
a O
blue O
silk N
scarf N
and O
hanks N
of O
hair N
as O
black O
as O
soot N
. O

Her O
eyes N
were O
veined O
with O
red O
. O

“ O
Nonetheless O
, O
” O
the O
traveler H
said O
, O
and O
she O
walked O
out H
. O

They O
were O
laughing O
at O
the O
chemist H
as O
well O
as O
at O
the O
traveler H
. O

To O
find O
anyone O
still O
proud O
, O
anyone O
who O
believed O
in O
giants A
or O
shame N
, O
was O
hilarious O
. O

The O
air N
of O
the O
bar N
was O
acrid O
with O
triumph N
. O

Finding O
someone H
even O
more O
vulnerable O
and O
foolish O
than O
we H
were O
, O
after O
everything O
had O
been O
taken O
from O
us H
— O
that O
was O
a O
delight N
. O

But O
I H
followed O
the O
traveler H
, O
into O
the O
wet O
streets N
. O

The O
smell O
of O
fish A
oozed O
from O
the O
docks N
. O

Here O
and O
there O
were O
bits N
of O
charred O
debris N
in O
the O
gutters N
. O

I H
caught O
her O
at O
her O
door N
. O

She O
invited O
me H
in O
for O
tea N
and O
massage N
. O

Her O
limbs N
were O
weathered O
and O
ringed O
, O
like O
the O
branches N
of O
trees A
in O
the O
dry H
country N
. O

She O
smelled O
like O
honey N
that O
has O
been O
kept O
a O
while O
in O
a O
dark O
room N
, O
a O
little O
fermented O
. O

A H
heady O
smell O
. O

In O
the O
morning N
, O
brilliant O
sunlight N
scoured O
the O
walls N
and O
the O
floor N
, O
and O
the O
traveler H
and O
her O
pack O
were O
gone O
. O

I H
hurried O
home N
. O

My H
house N
had O
survived O
the O
war N
with O
all O
its O
brown O
clay O
walls N
intact O
, O
though O
the O
garden N
and O
the O
courtyard N
were O
a O
heap N
of O
blackened O
rubble N
. O

My H
house N
was O
empty O
and O
cold O
. O

I H
packed O
six O
loaves N
of O
flatbread N
, O
some O
olives N
, O
a O
hard O
cheese N
, O
one N
nice O
dress O
, O
walking O
clothes N
, O
my H
pills N
and O
glasses N
, O
a O
jug N
of O
wine N
, O
a O
can-teen O
of O
water N
, O
and O
a O
kitchen N
knife N
. O

I H
sat O
in O
the O
shadow N
in O
my H
living O
room N
for O
a O
while O
, O
looking O
at O
the O
amorphous O
mass O
of O
the O
blanket N
I H
had O
been O
crocheting O
. O

That O
granddaughter H
: O
her O
parents H
both O
worked O
in O
the O
vineyards N
, O
and O
when O
she O
was O
a O
child H
, O
she O
would O
play O
in O
my H
courtyard N
in O
the O
after O
- O
noons N
. O

When O
she O
scraped O
her O
knees N
bloody O
on O
the O
stones N
, O
she O
refused O
to O
cry N
. O

She O
would O
cry N
from O
frustration N
when O
the O
older O
children H
could O
do O
something O
that O
she O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
— O
like O
tie N
knots N
, O
or O
catch O
a O
chicken N
. O

— O
Prologue N
— O

It O
had O
taken O
only O
a O
matter N
of O
hours N
for O
the O
Kethlan O
system N
to O
become O
a O
tumbling O
sea N
of O
debris N
; O
the O
twisted O
and O
burnt O
- O
out H
remnants N
of O
a O
once O
glorious O
Imperial O
nation N
. O

An O
empire N
whose O
costly O
mistakes N
would O
for O
many O
years N
to O
come O
echo O
into O
every O
corner N
of O
the O
known O
galaxy N
. O

And O
with O
those O
mistakes N
would O
come O
death N
to O
billions N
of O
innocent O
, O
unsuspecting O
lives O
. O

A H
starfighter O
hurtled O
through O
the O
scattered O
metal O
, O
the O
pilot O
desperate O
to O
find O
a O
way N
to O
stop N
himself O
from O
joining O
the O
ever O
growing O
population N
of O
this O
interstellar O
graveyard N
. O

Jacques H
Chalmers O
was O
not O
alone O
in O
his O
frustration N
with O
the O
current O
situation N
, O
but O
he O
was O
doubtless O
one N
of O
the O
most O
panicked O
. O

He O
tried O
to O
steady O
himself O
as O
he O
began O
cycling O
once O
again O
through O
the O
available O
display O
options N
for O
his O
starfighter's O
starfighter O
's H
radar N
system N
. O

His O
anxiety N
continued O
to O
grow O
with O
each O
passing O
second N
, O
every O
change O
of O
the O
screen N
doing O
nothing N
to O
abate O
it O
. O

He O
stopped O
midway O
through O
the O
calibration N
and O
glanced O
out H
of O
his O
cockpit N
. O

The O
scene N
was O
the O
same O
as O
it O
had O
been O
a O
few O
moments N
ago O
and O
it O
brought O
him O
no O
comfort O
. O

He O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
count O
the O
number N
of O
capital N
ships N
that O
dominated O
the O
Enemy's O
Enemy O
's H
frontline O
. O

Twenty O
? O

Thirty O
? O

Fifty O
? O

In O
his O
years N
of O
service N
to O
the O
Imperial O
Naval O
Forces O
he O
had O
never O
seen O
anything O
like O
it O
, O
not O
even O
in O
archive O
war N
footage N
. O

The O
enormous O
forms N
of O
the O
battleships N
loomed O
like O
giants A
atop O
a O
hill N
, O
staring O
down O
upon O
a O
tiny O
village N
below O
. O

Then O
there O
were O
the O
Enemy O
starfighters O
themselves O
: O
hundreds N
at O
least O
, O
swarming O
about O
like O
a O
huge O
wall N
of O
locusts A
. O

Knowing O
that O
he O
had O
already O
been O
flying O
straight O
for O
longer O
than O
was O
advisable O
, O
Chalmers O
altered O
his O
course N
to O
attempt N
to O
throw O
off O
any O
pursuers H
. O

* O
* O
* O

Not O
long O
before O
he O
had O
been O
standing N
on O
the O
flight N
deck N
of O
his O
deployment N
carrier N
, O
amongst O
the O
other O
pilots H
, O
his O
heart N
pumping O
in O
his O
ears N
, O
his O
hands N
sweating O
as O
he O
awaited O
the O
order O
to O
board N
his O
fighter N
. O

Chalmers O
saw O
his O
friends H
run O
forward O
as O
their O
names N
were O
called O
out H
, O
scrambling O
into O
cockpits N
, O
pulling O
on O
helmets N
and O
performing N
last O
- O
minute O
safety N
checks N
. O

Though O
most O
hid O
it O
well O
, O
he O
was O
convinced O
they O
were O
all O
as O
nervous O
and O
scared O
as O
he O
was O
- O
knowing O
they O
could O
well O
be O
speeding O
only O
to O

he O
watched O
his O
friends' O
friends H

fighters N
hurtle O
down O
the O

his O
commanding O
officer H

standing N

“ O
Right O
, O
listen O
up O

he O
started O

“ O
This O
is O
where O

The O

Tonight O

fight N
the O
battle N
for O
Kethlan O

for O
the O

the O
battle N
for O

survival N

on O

actions N

Make O
them O
proud O
! O
” O

Hundreds N
of O
millions N
? O
thought O
Chalmers O
. O

Is O
that O
all O
that's O
that O
's H
left O
? O

A H
few O
months N
ago O
it O
was O
billions N
. O

This O
day N
had O
crept O
ever O
closer O
as O
cities N
, O
planets N
and O
then O
entire O
star N
systems N
had O
fallen O
to O
the O
Enemy O
; O
to O
those O
damned O
Pandorans O
; O
to O
the O
Senate's O
Senate O
's H
mistake N
. O

How O
many O
of O
his O
friends H
had O
he O
lost O
over O
these O
last O
few O
terrible O
months N
? O

Had O
they O
died O
fast O
or O
were O
they O
now O
suffering N
a O
fate N
far O
worse O
. O
. O
? O

As O
his O
CO O
continued O
to O
pump O
them O
up O
for O
the O
critical O
battle N
, O
Chalmers' O
Chalmers O
' O
head N
was O
filled O
with O
visions N
of O
row N
upon O
row N
of O
black O
- O
clad O
soldiers H
. O

A H
white O
emblem N
resided O
on O
their O
right O
arms N
and O
left O
breast N
, O
an O
all O
- O
encompassing O
full O
black O
helmet N
upon O
their O
heads N
, O
its O
smooth O
form N
negating O
all O
facial O
features O
. O

Two O
bright O
red O
oval O
spheres N
were O
set O
into O
an O
eye N
- O
level N
groove N
that O
ran O
all O
around O
, O
the O
“ O
eyes N
” O
themselves O
slanted O
into O
a O
menacing O
and O
intimidating O
scowl N
. O

One O
of O
the O
soldiers H
turned O
to O
face N
him O
, O
the O
ruby N
- O
like O
eyes N
seeming O
to O
pierce O
his O
very O
soul N
. O

He O
felt N
his O
hand N
tighten O
on O
the O
flight N
helmet N
he O
held O
, O
swallowing O
hard O
. O

“ O
Daniels H
! O
Peterson H
! O
Foster H
! O
Brown H
! O
Rye O
... O
” O
a O
voice H
called O
out H
above O
the O
other O
sounds N
that O
filled O
the O
flight N
deck N
. O

Feet N
moved O
and O
Chalmers O
felt N
his O
stomach N
lurch O
. O

His O
name N
would O
be O
called O
soon O
. O

He O
felt N
a O
sense N
of O
doom N
. O

If O
the O
Empire O
could O
not O
stop N
the O
Enemy O
before O
, O
what O
hope O
did O
they O
have O
now O
? O

The O
Enemy's O
Enemy O
's H
power N
had O
grown O
exponentially O
and O
they O
had O
crushed O
everything O
in O
their O
path N
with O
harrowing O
little O
effort N
. O

Chalmers O
was O
feeling O
forced O
to O
accept O
the O
truth N
: O
they O
were O
all O
that O
was O
left O
of O
the O
Imperial O
Naval O
Forces O
. O

This O
was O
a O
battle N
that O
could O
not O
be O
won O
; O
not O
now O
, O
not O
ever O
. O

“ O
... O
Tyler H
! O
Flynn H
! O
Chalmers O
! O
King H
! O
Golden H
! O
Blair H
... O
” O

At O
the O
sound N
of O
his O
name N
, O
Chalmers O
felt N
himself O
move O
robotically O
, O
his O
mind N
screaming O
in O
protest N
against O
what O
his O
legs N
were O
doing O
. O

He O
ran O
over O
to O
the O
waiting O
starfighter O
, O
threw O
on O
his O
helmet N
and O
begun O
ascending O
the O
ladder N
into O
the O
cockpit N
. O

Zombie H
- O
like O
he O
sank O
down O
into O
the O
seat N
, O
watching O
as O
if O
from O
outside O
his O
body N
as O
his O
hands N
buckled O
him O
in O
, O
his O
fingers N
flip O
switches N
, O
press N
buttons N
, O
acknowledge O
questions N
and O
confirmations N
on O
the O
screens N
before O
him O
. O

Moments N
later O
, O
his O
craft N
was O
taxied O
to O
the O
catapult N
and O
before O
long O
he'd O
he O
'd O
found O
himself O
out H
in O
space N
and O
into O
the O
thick O
of O
battle N
. O

At O
that O
moment N
, O
his O
worst O
fears N
had O
not O
only O
been O
altogether O
realised O
, O
but O
far O
exceeded O
. O

What O
the O
Moon O
Brings O

I H
hate O
the O
moon N
- O
I H
am O
afraid O
of O
it O
- O
for O
when O
it O
shines O
on O
certain O
scenes N
familiar O
and O
loved O
it O
sometimes O
makes O
them O
unfamiliar O
and O
hideous O
. O

It O
was O
in O
the O
spectral O
summer N
when O
the O
moon N
shone O
down O
on O
the O
old O
garden N
where O
I H
wandered O
; O
the O
spectral O
summer N
of O
narcotic O
flowers A
and O
humid O
seas N
of O
foliage N
that O
bring O
wild O
and O
many O
- O
coloured O
dreams N
. O

And O
as O
I H
walked O
by O
the O
shallow O
crystal N
stream O
I H
saw O
unwonted O
ripples N
tipped O
with O
yellow O
light N
, O
as O
if O
those O
placid O
waters N
were O
drawn O
on O
in O
resistless O
currents N
to O
strange O
oceans N
that O
are O
not O
in O
the O
world N
. O

Silent O
and O
sparkling O
, O
bright O
and O
baleful O
, O
those O
moon N
- O
cursed O
waters N
hurried O
I H
knew O
not O
whither O
; O
whilst O
from O
the O
embowered O
banks N
white O
lotos A
- O
blossoms N
fluttered O
one N
by O
one N
in O
the O
opiate O
night N
- O
wind N
and O
dropped O
despairingly O
into O
the O
stream O
, O
swirling O
away O
horribly O
under O
the O
arched O
, O
carven O
bridge N
, O
and O
staring O
back O
with O
the O
sinister O
resignation N
of O
calm O
, O
dead O
faces N
. O

And O
as O
I H
ran O
along O
the O
shore N
, O
crushing O
sleeping O
flowers A
with O
heedless O
feet N
and O
maddened O
ever O
by O
the O
fear N
of O
unknown O
things N
and O
the O
lure N
of O
the O
dead O
faces N
, O
I H
saw O
that O
the O
garden N
had O
no O
end N
under O
that O
moon N
; O
for O
where O
by O
day N
the O
walls N
were O
, O
there O
stretched O
now O
only O
new O
vistas N
of O
trees A
and O
paths N
, O
flowers A
and O
shrubs A
, O
stone N
idols N
and O
pagodas N
, O
and O
bendings N
of O
the O
yellow O
- O
litten O
stream O
past N
grassy O
banks N
and O
under O
grotesque O
bridges N
of O
marble N
. O

And O
the O
lips N
of O
the O
dead O
lotos A
- O
faces N
whispered O
sadly O
, O
and O
bade O
me H
follow O
, O
nor O
did O
I H
cease O
my H
steps N
till O
the O
stream O
became O
a O
river N
, O
and O
joined O
amidst O
marshes N
of O
swaying O
reeds A
and O
beaches N
of O
gleaming O
sand N
the O
shore N
of O
a O
vast O
and O
nameless O
sea N
. O

Upon O
that O
sea N
the O
hateful O
moon N
shone O
, O
and O
over O
its O
unvocal O
waves N
weird O
perfumes N
breeded O
. O

And O
as O
I H
saw O
therein O
the O
lotos A
- O
faces N
vanish O
, O
I H
longed O
for O
nets N
that O
I H
might O
capture O
them O
and O
learn O
from O
them O
the O
secrets N
which O
the O
moon N
had O
brought O
upon O
the O
night N
. O

But O
when O
that O
moon N
went O
over O
to O
the O
west O
and O
the O
still O
tide N
ebbed O
from O
the O
sullen O
shore N
, O
I H
saw O
in O
that O
light N
old O
spires N
that O
the O
waves N
almost O
uncovered O
, O
and O
white O
columns N
gay O
with O
festoons N
of O
green O
seaweed A
. O

And O
knowing O
that O
to O
this O
sunken O
place N
all O
the O
dead O
had O
come O
, O
I H
trembled O
and O
did O
not O
wish O
again O
to O
speak O
with O
the O
lotos A
- O
faces N
. O

Yet O
when O
I H
saw O
afar O
out H
in O
the O
sea N
a O
black O
condor A
descend O
from O
the O
sky O
to O
seek O
rest N
on O
a O
vast O
reef N
, O
I H
would O
fain O
have O
questioned O
him O
, O
and O
asked O
him O
of O
those O
whom O
I H
had O
known O
when O
they O
were O
alive O
. O

This O
I H
would O
have O
asked O
him O
had O
he O
not O
been O
so O
far O
away O
, O
but O
he O
was O
very O
far O
, O
and O
could O
not O
be O
seen O
at O
all O
when O
he O
drew O
nigh O
that O
gigantic O
reef N
. O

So O
I H
watched O
the O
tide N
go O
out H
under O
that O
sinking O
moon N
, O
and O
saw O
gleaming O
the O
spires N
, O
the O
towers N
, O
and O
the O
roofs N
of O
that O
dead O
, O
dripping O
city N
. O

And O
as O
I H
watched O
, O
my H
nostrils N
tried O
to O
close O
against O
the O
perfume N
- O
conquering O
stench N
of O
the O
world's O
world N
's H
dead O
; O
for O
truly O
, O
in O
this O
unplaced O
and O
forgotten O
spot N
had O
all O
the O
flesh O
of O
the O
churchyards N
gathered O
for O
puffy O
sea N
- O
worms A
to O
gnaw O
and O
glut O
upon O
. O

Over O
these O
horrors N
the O
evil O
moon N
now O
hung O
very O
low O
, O
but O
the O
puffy O
worms A
of O
the O
sea N
need O
no O
moon N
to O
feed O
by O
. O

And O
as O
I H
watched O
the O
ripples N
that O
told O
of O
the O
writhing O
of O
worms A
beneath O
, O
I H
felt N
a O
new O
chill O
from O
afar O
out H
whither O
the O
condor A
had O
flown O
, O
as O
if O
my H
flesh O
had O
caught O
a O
horror N
before O
my H
eyes N
had O
seen O
it O
. O

Nor O
had O
my H
flesh O
trembled O
without O
cause N
, O
for O
when O
I H
raised O
my H
eyes N
I H
saw O
that O
the O
waters N
had O
ebbed O
very O
low O
, O
shewing O
much O
of O
the O
vast O
reef N
whose O
rim N
I H
had O
seen O
before O
. O

And O
when O
I H
saw O
that O
the O
reef N
was O
but O
the O
black O
basalt N
crown N
of O
a O
shocking O
eikon O
whose O
monstrous O
forehead N
now O
shown O
in O
the O
dim O
moonlight N
and O
whose O
vile O
hooves N
must O
paw O
the O
hellish O
ooze N
miles N
below O
, O
I H
shrieked O
and O
shrieked O
lest O
the O
hidden O
face N
rise N
above O
the O
waters N
, O
and O
lest O
the O
hidden O
eyes N
look O
at O
me H
after O
the O
slinking O
away O
of O
that O
leering O
and O
treacherous O
yellow O
moon N
. O

And O
to O
escape O
this O
relentless O
thing N
I H
plunged O
gladly O
and O
unhesitantly O
into O
the O
stinking O
shallows N
where O
amidst O
weedy O
walls N
and O
sunken O
streets N
fat O
sea N
- O
worms A
feast O
upon O
the O
world's O
world N
's H
dead O
. O

“ O
It O
doesn’t O
does O
n’t O
hurt O
, O
Gram H
, O
” O
Renata O
says O
. O

My H
sixteen O
- O
year N
- O
old O
daughter H
pulls O
up O
her O
T H
- O
shirt N
sleeve N
to O
show O
her O
bare O
arm N
, O
the O
skin N
summer N
brown O
and O
the O
muscle N
swelling O
slightly O
into O
smooth O
biceps N
, O
flawless O
. O

“ O
I H
had O
it O
done O
when O
I H
was O
little O
and O
see O
, O
you H
can’t O
ca O
n’t O
even O
tell O
. O
” O

My H
mother H
is O
sitting O
in O
the O
little O
examining O
room N
at O
the O
assisted O
living O
. O

Everything O
is O
white O
and O
hospital N
- O
like O
but O
there’s O
there O
’s H
no O
examining O
couch N
. O

There’s O
There O
’s H
just O
a O
desk N
, O
a O
little O
white O
table N
with O
two O
chairs N
and O
a O
scale N
. O

The O
doctor H
, O
a O
woman H
I H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
know O
, O
is O
sitting O
in O
the O
other O
chair N
. O

My H
mother H
is O
bewildered O
, O
her O
face N
turned O
up O
towards O
me H
. O

She’s O
She O
’s H
got O
Alzheimer’s O
Alzheimer O
’s H
. O

“ O
It’s O
It O
’s H
okay O
, O
Mom H
, O
” O
I H
say O
. O

She O
wants O
to O
understand O
, O
I H
can O
see O
that O
. O

So O
I H
explain O
again O
. O

“ O
It’s O
It O
’s H
an O
implant O
that O
will O
let O
them O
know O
where O
you H
are O
, O
and O
how O
you H
are O

It O
won’t O
wo O
n’t O
hurt O

” O

Her O
eyes N
water N
constantly O
, O
now O
. O

In O
the O
time N
it O
takes O
me H
to O
explain O
she O
grasps O
and O
loses O
the O
words N
, O
grasps O
and O
loses O
phrases N
as O
they O
go O
past N
. O

She O
looks O
at O
me H
and O
then O
at O
Renata O
, O
who O
is O
smiling O
, O
and O
finally O
submits O
uncomprehendingly O
. O

We H
have O
worn O
her O
down O
. O

The O
doctor H
bares O
my H
mother’s O
mother H
’s H
arm N
, O
where O
the O
crepey O
flesh O
hangs O
loosely O
on O
the O
bones N
. O

The O
doctor H
swabs O
her O
upper O
arm N
with O
antiseptic N
and O
says O
, O
“ O
I’m O
I H
’m O
going O
to O
give O
you H
something O
to O
numb O
it O
, O
okay O
? O
” O

To O
me H
the O
doctor H
says O
in O
her O
normal O
voice H
, O
“ O
It’s O
It O
’s H
just O
a O
little O
lidocaine N
. O
” O

I H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
like O
the O
doctor H
, O
but O
I H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
know O
why O
. O

She O
is O
no O
- O
nonsense N
. O

She O
has O
professional O
hair N
, O
lightly O
streaked O
. O

This O
is O
no O
reason N
to O
dislike N
her O
. O

My H
mother H
winces O
at O
the O
injection N
and O
is O
surprised O
again O
. O

She O
looks O
up O
at O
me H
, O
at O
Renata O
. O

We H
are O
smiling O
, O
both O
of O
us H
. O

“ O
Okay O
, O
” O
my H
mother H
says O
. O

What O
is O
okay O
? O

I H
have O
no O
idea N
. O

We H
wait N
for O
a O
few O
minutes N
. O

My H
mother H
says O
, O
“ O
Is O
it O
time N
to O
go O
? O
” O

“ O
Not O
yet O
, O
” O
I H
say O

“ O
They’re O
They O
’re O
going O
to O
give O
you H
an O
injection N

” O

“ O
What O
? O
” O
my H
mother H
says O
. O

“ O
They’re O
They O
’re O
going O
to O
implant O
a O
chip N
. O

It O
will O
help O
them O
take O
care N
of O
you H

” O

I H
try O
to O
say O
it O
every O
time N
as O
if O
it O
was O
the O
first O
time N
I H
said O
it O
. O

I H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
want O
to O
embarrass O
her O
. O

Her O
head N
swings N
around O
, O
from O
Renata O
to O
me H
to O
the O
doctor H
and O
then O
back O
to O
Renata O

“ O
It’s O
It O

okay O
, O
Gram H
, O
” O
Renata O
says O
. O

“ O
Renata O
, O
” O
my H
mother H
says O

The O
doctor H
has O
an O
injection N
gun N
and O
while O
my H
mother H
is O
focused O
on O
my H
daughter H
, O
she O
puts O
it O
firmly O
against O
my H
mother’s O
mother H

arm N
and O
puts O
the O
chip N
in O
. O

“ O
Oh O
! O
” O
says O
my H
mother H
. O

It’s O
It O
’s H
another O
low O
- O
grade N
moment N
of O
horror N
, O
but O
I H
think O
about O
that O
particular O
time N
with O
my H
mother H
because O
Renata O
was O
there O
and O
we H
were O
united O
, O
she O
and O
I H
. O

So O
that’s O
that O
’s H
a O
good O
memory N
. O

I H
come O
back O
to O
it O
a O
lot N
. O

In O
the O
background N
, O
shining O
, O
is O
Renata O
, O
who O
is O
young O
and O
healthy O
and O
good O
, O
raising O
her O
arm N
to O
show O
her O
grandmother H
that O
the O
chip N
is O
nothing N
, O
nothing N
at O
all O
. O

The O
last O
two O
nights N
I H
have O
dreamed O
of O
dogs A
in O
trouble N
. O

I H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
dream O
about O
Renata O
, O
although O
when O
the O
dreams N
wake O
me H
up O
, O
it’s O
it O
’s H
thinking O
about O
Renata O
that O
keeps O
me H
awake O
. O

The O
first O
night N
I H
dreamed O
of O
seeing O
a O
stray O
dog A
and O
not O
stopping O
to O
pick O
it O
up O
although O
it O
was O
wandering O
in O
an O
empty O
parking O
lot N
near O
a O
busy O
road N
. O

That O
was O
the O
first O
night N
Renata O
didn’t O
did O
n’t O
come O
home N
and O
it O
doesn’t O
does O
n’t O
take O
Freud H
to O
figure O
out H
what O
that O
meant O
. O

Seventeen O
- O
year N
- O
olds N
sleep O
on O
friends’ O
friends H
’ O
couches N
, O
I H
know O
. O

Or O
Renata O
might O
be O
sleeping O
in O
her O
car N
. O

The O
second N
night N
I H
dreamed O
that O
I H
was O
on O
a O
desert N
island N
and O
Sonia H
, O
our H
golden O
retriever A
, O
was O
with O
me H
. O

There O
was O
some O
horrible O
fate N
impending O
for O
Sonia H
and O
I H
had O
to O
kill O
her O
before O
something O
worse O
happened O
. O

I H
laid O
her O
down O
on O
some O
sticks N
. O

She O
trusts O
me H
, O
she’s O
she O
’s H
more O
my H
dog A
than O
anyone’s O
anyone O
’s H
, O
and O
she O
didn’t O
did O
n’t O
like O
it O
but O
for O
me H
she O
lay O
there O
. O

In O
my H
dream O
I H
told O
her O
, O
“ O
Stay O
, O
Sonia H
. O
Stay O
. O
” O

She O
stayed O
because O
I H
held O
her O
there O
by O
looking O
at O
her O
, O
the O
way N
you H
can O
sometimes O
will O
a O
dog A
into O
submission N
. O

She O
stayed O
while O
I H
lit O
the O
fire N
. O

And O
then O
the O
horror N
of O
it O
all O
hit O
me H
and O
I H
said O
, O
“ O
Sonia H
, O
up O
! O
” O

And O
I H
woke O
up O
. O

That O
was O
last O
night N
, O
the O
second N
night N
Renata O
didn’t O
did O
n’t O
come O
home N
. O

— O
Ted H
Bundy O

It O
didn't O
did O
n't O
start O
out H
here O
. O

Not O
with O
the O
scramblers H
or O
Rorschach O
, O
not O
with O
Big O
Ben H
or O
Theseus O
or O
the O
vampires A
. O

Most O
people N
would O
say O
it O
started O
with O
the O
Fireflies O
, O
but O
they'd O
they O
'd O
be O
wrong O
. O

It O
ended O
with O
all O
those O
things N
. O

For O
me H
, O
it O
began O
with O
Robert H
Paglino O
. O

At O
the O
age N
of O
eight O
, O
he O
was O
my H
best O
and O
only O
friend H
. O

We H
were O
fellow H
outcasts H
, O
bound O
by O
complementary O
misfortune N
. O

Mine H
was O
developmental O
. O

His O
was O
genetic O
: O
an O
uncontrolled O
genotype A
that O
left O
him O
predisposed O
to O
nearsightedness N
, O
acne N
, O
and O
( O
as O
it O
later O
turned O
out H
) O
predisposed O
to O
a O
susceptibility N
to O
narcotics N
. O

His O
parents H
had O
never O
had O
him O
optimized O
. O

Those O
few O
TwenCen O
relics N
who O
still O
believed O
in O
God H
also O
held O
that O
one N
shouldn't O
should O
n't O
try O
to O
improve O
upon O
His O
handiwork N
. O

So O
although O
both O
of O
us H
could O
have O
been O
repaired O
, O
only O
one N
of O
us H
had O
been O
repaired O
. O

I H
arrived O
at O
the O
playground N
to O
find O
Pag O
the O
center N
of O
attention N
for O
some O
half O
- O
dozen N
kids H
, O
those O
lucky O
few O
in O
front N
punching O
him O
in O
the O
head N
, O
the O
others O
making O
do O
with O
taunts N
of O
mongrel N
and O
polly O
while O
waiting O
their O
turn O
. O

I H
watched O
him O
raise O
his O
arms N
, O
almost O
hesitantly O
, O
to O
ward O
off O
the O
worst O
of O
the O
blows O
. O

I H
could O
see O
into O
his O
head N
better O
than O
I H
could O
see O
into O
my H
own O
; O
he O
was O
scared O
that O
his O
attackers H
might O
think O
those O
hands N
were O
coming O
up O
to O
hit O
back O
, O
that O
they'd O
they O
'd O
read O
it O
as O
an O
act N
of O
defiance N
and O
hurt O
him O
even O
more O
. O

Even O
then O
, O
at O
the O
tender O
age N
of O
eight O
and O
with O
half O
my H
mind N
gone O
, O
I H
was O
becoming O
a O
superlative O
observer H
. O

But O
I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
do O
. O

I H
hadn't O
had O
n't O
seen O
much O
of O
Pag O
lately O
. O

I H
was O
pretty O
sure O
he'd O
he O
'd O
been O
avoiding O
me H
. O

Still O
, O
when O
your H
best O
friend's O
friend H
's H
in O
trouble N
you H
help O
out H
, O
right O
? O

Even O
if O
the O
odds O
are O
impossible O
— O
and O
how O
many O
eight O
- O
year N
- O
olds N
would O
go O
up O
against O
six O
bigger O
kids H
for O
a O
sandbox N
buddy H
? O
— O
at O
least O
you H
call O
for O
backup H
. O

Flag O
a O
sentry H
. O

Something O
. O

I H
just O
stood O
there O
. O

I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
even O
especially O
want O
to O
help O
him O
. O

That O
didn't O
did O
n't O
make O
sense N
. O

Even O
if O
he O
hadn't O
had O
n't O
been O
my H
best O
friend H
, O
I H
should O
at O
least O
have O
empathized O
. O

I'd O
I H
'd O
suffered O
less O
than O
Pag O
in O
the O
way N
of O
overt O
violence N
; O
my H
seizures N
tended O
to O
keep O
the O
other O
kids H
at O
a O
distance N
, O
scared O
them O
even O
as O
they O
incapacitated O
me H
. O

Still O
. O

I H
was O
no O
stranger H
to O
the O
taunts N
and O
insults N
, O
or O
the O
foot N
that O
appears O
from O
nowhere O
to O
trip N
you H
up O
en O
route N
from O
A H
to O
B H
. O

I H
knew O
how O
that O
felt N
. O

Or O
I H
had O
, O
once O
. O

But O
that O
part N
of O
me H
had O
been O
cut O
out H
along O
with O
the O
bad O
wiring N
. O

I H
was O
still O
working O
up O
the O
algorithms N
to O
get O
it O
back O
, O
still O
learning O
by O
observation N
. O

Pack O
animals A
always O
tear N
apart O
the O
weaklings H
in O
their O
midst N
. O

Every O
child H
knows O
that O
much O
instinctively O
. O

Maybe O
I H
should O
just O
let O
that O
process N
unfold O
, O
maybe O
I H
shouldn't O
should O
n't O
try O
to O
mess N
with O
nature N
. O

Then O
again O
, O
Pag's O
Pag O
's H
parents H
hadn't O
had O
n't O
messed O
with O
nature N
, O
and O
look O
what O
it O
got O
them O
: O
a O
son H
curled O
up O
in O
the O
dirt N
while O
a O
bunch N
of O
engineered O
superboys O
kicked O
in O
his O
ribs N
. O

In O
the O
end N
, O
propaganda N
worked O
where O
empathy N
failed O
. O

Back N
then O
I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
so O
much O
think O
as O
observe O
, O
didn't O
did O
n't O
deduce O
so O
much O
as O
remember O
— O
and O
what O
I H
remembered O
was O
a O
thousand O
inspirational O
stories N
lauding O
anyone O
who O
ever O
stuck O
up O
for O
the O
underdog H
. O

So O
I H
picked O
up O
a O
rock N
the O
size N
of O
my H
fist N
and O
hit O
two O
of O
Pag's O
Pag O
's H
assailants H
across O
the O
backs N
of O
their O
heads N
before O
anyone O
even O
knew O
I H
was O
in O
the O
game N
. O

A H
third O
, O
turning O
to O
face N
the O
new O
threat N
, O
took O
a O
blow O
to O
the O
face N
that O
audibly O
crunched O
the O
bones N
of O
his O
cheek N
. O

I H
remember O
wondering O
why O
I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
take O
any O
satisfaction N
from O
that O
sound N
, O
why O
it O
meant O
nothing N
beyond O
the O
fact N
I H
had O
one N
less O
opponent H
to O
worry O
about O
. O

The O
rest N
of O
them O
ran O
at O
the O
sight N
of O
blood N
. O

One O
of O
the O
braver O
promised O
me H
I H
was O
dead O
, O
shouted O
" O
Fucking O
zombie H
! O
" O
over O
his O
shoulder N
as O
he O
disappeared O
around O
the O
corner N
. O

Three O
decades N
it O
took O
, O
to O
see O
the O
irony N
in O
that O
remark N
. O

Two O
of O
the O
enemy N
twitched O
at O
my H
feet N
. O

I H
kicked O
one N
in O
the O
head N
until O
it O
stopped O
moving O
, O
turned O
to O
the O
other O
. O

Something O
grabbed O
my H
arm N
and O
I H
swung O
without O
thinking O
, O
without O
looking O
until O
Pag O
yelped O
and O
ducked O
out H
of O
reach O
. O

" O
Oh O
, O
" O
I H
said O
. O

" O
Sorry O
. O
" O

One O
thing N
lay O
motionless O
. O

The O
other O
moaned O
and O
held O
its O
head N
and O
curled O
up O
in O
a O
ball N
. O

" O
Oh O
shit O
, O
" O
Pag O
panted O
. O

Blood N
coursed O
unheeded O
from O
his O
nose N
and O
splattered O
down O
his O
shirt N
. O

His O
cheek N
was O
turning O
blue O
and O
yellow O
. O

" O
Oh O
shit O
oh O
shit O
oh O
shit O
... O
" O

I H
thought O
of O
something O
to O
say O
. O

" O
You H
all O
right O
? O
" O

" O
Oh O
shit O
, O
you H
— O
I H
mean O
, O
you H
never O
... O
" O

He O
wiped O
his O
mouth N
. O

Blood N
smeared O
the O
back O
of O
his O
hand N
. O

" O
Oh O
man H
are O
we H
in O
trouble N
. O
" O

" O
They O
started O
it O
. O
" O

" O
Yeah O
, O
but O
you H
— O
I H
mean O
, O
look O
at O
them O
! O
" O

The O
moaning O
thing N
was O
crawling O
away O
on O
all O
fours N
. O

I H
wondered O
how O
long O
it O
would O
be O
before O
it O
found O
reinforcements N
. O

I H
wondered O
if O
I H
should O
kill O
it O
before O
then O
. O

" O
You'd O
You H
'd O
a O
never O
done O
that O
before O
, O
" O
Pag O
said O
. O

Before O
the O
operation N
, O
he O
meant O
. O

I H
actually O
did O
feel O
something O
then O
— O
faint O
, O
distant O
, O
but O
unmistakable O
. O

I H
felt N
angry O
. O

" O
They O
started O
— O
" O

Pag O
backed O
away O
, O
eyes N
wide O
. O

" O
What O
are O
you H
doing O
? O

Put O
that O
down O
! O
" O

I'd O
I H
'd O
raised O
my H
fists N
. O

I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
remember O
doing O
that O
. O

I H
unclenched O
them O
. O

It O
took O
a O
while O
. O

I H
had O
to O
look O
at O
my H
hands N
very O
hard O
for O
a O
long O
, O
long O
time N
. O

The O
rock N
dropped O
to O
the O
ground N
, O
blood N
- O
slick O
and O
glistening O
. O

" O
I H
was O
trying O
to O
help O

" O

I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
understand O
why O
he O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
see O
that O
. O

" O
You're O
You H
're O
, O
you're H
you H
're O
not O
the O

It O
was O
Sunday O
in O
snowy O
Manhattan O
. O

Jenna H
was O
in O
the O
tub N
, O
and O
I H
was O
doing O
the O
Times O
crossword N
, O
listening O
to O
the O
clang N
of O
the O
radiators N

the O
swish N
of O
the O
taxis N
on O
the O
slush N
outside O
, O
when O
my H
coffee N
- O
scented O
reverie N
was O
broken O
by O
a O
loud O
squawk N
from O
the O
bathroom N
, O
and O
a O
splash N
, O
and O
a O
flesh O
- O
upon O
- O
cold O
- O
tile N
sort N

thump N

“ O
Go O
away O
! O

Shoo O
! O

Get O
out H
of O
my H
bathroom N
! O
” O

I H
threw O
down O
my H
pen N
and O
dashed O
down O
the O
hall N
. O

Jenna H
was O
picking O
herself O
up O
off O
the O
floor N
of O
the O
bathroom N
. O

In O
the O
bathtub N
, O
a O
bar N
of O
soap N
was O
gaily O
chasing O
a O
nylon N
scrubby O
thing N
around O
the O
surface N
of O
the O
water N
. O

“ O
Damned O
pixies A
! O
” O
Jenna H
said O
, O
smacking O
the O
bathtub’s O
bathtub N
’s H
drain N
lever N

“ O
Again O
! O

I H
am O
so O
tired O
of O
these O
things N
! O
” O

A H
piteous O
squeak N
came O
from O
the O
scrubby O
thing N
as O
the O
water N
began O
to O
swirl O
down O
the O
drain N
. O

A H
translucent O
little O
head N
poked O
out H
from O
behind O
a O
pot N
of O
organic O
- O
sugarcane N
exfoliating O
body N
polish N

and O
looked O
at O
me H
with O
exaggerated O
puppy A
eyes N
and O
a O
trembling O
lower O
lip N

“ O
Sorry O
, O
kids H

” O
I H
said O
to O
the O
bathtub N

“ O
Don’t O

stomped O

naked O

still O
wet O

She’d O
She O

footprints N

the O

Whatever O

that O
the O

I H
couldn’t O

She O

I H
did O

because O
she’s O
she O

the O

Although O

Rachel H
Rook O
took O
Carroll H
home N
to O
meet O
her O
parents H
two O
months N
after O
she O
first O
slept O
with O
him O
. O

For O
a O
generous O
girl H
, O
a O
girl H
who O
took O
off O
her O
clothes N
with O
abandon N
, O
she O
was O
remarkably O
close O
- O
mouthed O
about O
some O
things N
. O

In O
two O
months N
Carroll H
had O
learned O
that O
her O
parents H
lived O
on O
a O
farm N
several O
miles N
outside O
of O
town N
; O
that O
they O
sold O
strawberries N
in O
summer N
, O
and O
sold O
Christmas O
trees A
in O
the O
winter N
. O

He O
knew O
that O
they O
never O
left O
the O
farm N
; O
instead O
, O
the O
world N
came O
to O
them O
in O
the O
shape N
of O
weekend N
picnickers H
and O
driveby O
tourists H
. O

Do O
you H
think O
your H
parents H
will O
like O
me H
? O
" O
he O
said O
. O

He O
had O
spent O
the O
afternoon N
preparing O
for O
this O
visit O
as O
carefully O
as O
if O
he O
were O
preparing O
for O
an O
exam N
. O

He O
had O
gotten O
his O
hair N
cut O
, O
trimmed O
his O
nails N
, O
washed O
his O
neck N
and O
behind O
his O
ears N
. O

The O
outfit N
he O
had O
chosen O
, O
khaki O
pants N
and O
a O
blue O
button N
- O
down O
shirt N
-- O
no O
tie N
-- O
lay O
neatly O
folded O
on O
the O
bed N
. O

He O
stood O
before O
Rachel H
in O
his O
plain O
white O
underwear N
and O
white O
socks N
, O
gazing O
at O
her O
as O
if O
she O
were O
a O
mirror N
. O

" O
No O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
time N
she O
had O
been O
to O
his O
apartment N
, O
and O
she O
stood O
square N
in O
the O
center N
of O
his O
bedroom N
, O
her O
arms N
folded O
against O
her O
body N
as O
if O
she O
was O
afraid O
to O
sit O
down O
, O
to O
touch O
something O
. O

" O
Why O
? O
" O

" O
My H
father H
will O
like O
you H
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O

" O
But O
he O
likes O
everyone O
. O

My H
mother's O
mother H
's H
more O
particular O
-- O

she O
thinks O
that O
you H
lack N
a O
serious O
nature N
. O
" O

Carroll H
put O
on O
his O
pants N
, O
admiring O
the O
crease N
. O

" O
So O
you've O
you H
've O
talked O
to O
her O
about O
me H
. O
" O

" O
Yes O
. O
" O

" O
But O
you H
haven't O
have O
n't O
talked O
about O
her O
to O
me H
. O
" O

" O
No O
. O
" O

" O
Are O
you H
ashamed O
of O
her O
? O
" O

Rachel H
snorted O
. O

Then O
she O
sighed O
in O
a O
way N
that O
seemed O
to O
suggest O
she O
was O
regretting O
her O
decision N
to O
take O
him O
home N
. O

" O
You're O
You H
're O
ashamed O
of O
me H
, O
" O
he O
guessed O
, O
and O
Rachel H
kissed O
him O
and O
smiled O
and O
didn't O
did O
n't O
say O
anything O
. O

Rachel H
still O
lived O
on O
her O
parents' O
parents H
' O
farm N
, O
which O
made O
it O
all O
the O
more O
remarkable O
that O
she O
had O
kept O
Carroll H
and O
her O
parents H
apart O
for O
so O
long O
. O

It O
suggested O
a O
talent N
for O
daily O
organization N
that O
filled O
Carroll's O
Carroll H
's H
heart N
with O
admiration N
and O
lust N
. O

She O
was O
nineteen O
, O
two O
years N
younger O
than O
Carroll H
; O
she O
was O
a O
student H
at O
Jellicoh O
College N
and O
every O
weekday N
she O
rose O
at O
seven O
and O
biked O
four O
miles N
into O
town N
, O
and O
then O
back O
again O
on O
her O
bike N
, O
four O
miles N
uphill O
to O
the O
farm N
. O

Carroll H
met O
Rachel H
in O
the O
Jellicoh O
College N
library N
, O
where O
he O
had O
a O
part N
- O
time N
job N
. O

He O
sat O
at O
the O
checkout N
desk N
, O
stamping O
books N
and O
reading O
Tristram O
Shandy O
for O
a O
graduate H
class N
; O
he O
was O
almost O
asleep O
when O
someone H
said O
, O
" O
Excuse O
me H
. O
" O

He O
looked O
up O
. O

The O
girl H
who O
stood O
before O
the O
tall O
desk N
was O
red O
- O
headed O
. O

Sunlight N
streaming O
in O
through O
a O
high O
window N
opposite N
her O
lit O
up O
the O
fine O
hairs N
on O
her O
arm N
, O
the O
embroidered O
flowers A
on O
the O
collar N
of O
her O
white O
shirt N
. O

The O
sunlight N
turned O
her O
hair N
to O
fire N
and O
Carroll H
found O
it O
difficult O
to O
look O
directly O
at O
her O
. O

" O
Can O
I H
help O
you H
? O
" O
he O
said O
. O

She O
placed O
a O
shredded O
rectangle N
on O
the O
desk N
, O
and O
Carroll H
picked O
it O
up O
between O
his O
thumb N
and O
forefinger N
. O

Pages N
hung O
in O
tatters N
from O
the O
sodden O
blue O
spine N
. O

Title N
, O
binding N
, O
and O
covers O
had O
been O
gnawed O
away O
. O

" O
I H
need O
to O
pay O
for O
a O
damaged O
book O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O

" O
What O
happened O
? O
Did O
your H
dog A
eat O
it O
? O
" O
he O
said O
, O
making O
a O
joke N
. O

" O
Yes O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
and O
smiled O
. O

" O
What's O
What O
's H
your H
name N
? O
" O
Carroll H
said O
. O

Already O
, O
he O
thought O
he O
might O
be O
in O
love O
. O

Doesn’t O
Does O
n’t O
it O
make O
you H
just O
want O
to O
sneeze N
? O

Pete H
was O
leaning O
against O
the O
wall N
, O
watching O
the O
street N
go O
by O
. O

I H
pulled O
the O
bike N
to O
a O
halt N
, O
the O
front N
wheel N
pointing O
in O
his O
direction N
. O

“ O
I H
think O
I’ve O
I H
’ve O
got O
a O
fairy O
stuck O
up O
my H
nose N
. O
” O

“ O
S’ O
not O
true O
! O
” O
came O
a O
voice H
from O
inside O
the O
nose N
in O
question N
. O

“ O
Hey O
! O
Not O
bad O
that O
! O
” O
Pete H
said O
. O

“ O
I H
didn’t O
did O
n’t O
see O
your H
lips N
move O
at O
all O
. O
” O

“ O
It’s O
It O
’s H
not O
a O
joke N
. O
” O

The O
itching N
was O
getting O
worse O
. O

I H
pulled O
out H
a O
paper N
tissue N
. O

“ O
Stop O
that O
now O
! O
” O
came O
the O
voice H
again O
. O

“ O
You H
know O
I H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
like O
it O
. O
” O

“ O
S’ O
not O
my H
fault N
. O

You H
make O
me H
want O
to O
sneeze N
! O
” O

And O
I H
did O
. O

I H
inspected O
the O
crumpled O
paper N
. O

Lots N
of O
yellow O
goo N
, O
but O
no O
fairy O
. O

Pete H
looked O
at O
me H
with O
mild O
disgust N
as O
I H
eyed O
the O
handkerchief N
more O
closely O
. O

“ O
You H
know O
that’s O
that O
’s H
pretty O
gross O
… O
” O
he O
said O
. O

“ O
Got O
any O
other O
brilliant O
remarks N
? O
” O
I H
said O
. O

I H
held O
a O
finger N
up O
to O
my H
lips N
, O
and O
waved O
a O
hand N
to O
silence N
Pete’s O
Pete H
’s H
reply O
. O

“ O
Are O
you H
still O
there O
? O
” O
I H
called O
. O

“ O
No O
thanks N
to O
you H
! O
” O
came O
the O
little O
voice H
. O

Pete H
looked O
at O
me H
sort N
of O
sideways O
. O

“ O
Look O
, O
the O
first O
time N
was O
OK O
, O
but O
— O
” O

“ O
It’s O
It O
’s H
not O
a O
joke N
. O

I’ve O
I H
’ve O
really O
got O
something O
stuck O
up O
there O
. O

I H
was O
riding N
on O
me H
bike N
and O
I H
thought O
I’d O
I H
’d O
swallowed O
an O
insect A
or O
something O
. O

And O
then O
it O
started O
insulting O
me H
. O
” O

“ O
You’re O
You H
’re O
having O
me H
on O
, O
right O
? O
” O

“ O
Pete H
! O

Look O
at O
me H
. O

If O
it’s O
it O
’s H
a O
trick N
, O
how O
do O
I H
do O
it O
then O
? O
” O

Pete H
thought O
for O
a O
moment N
. O

“ O
If O
it’s O
it O
’s H
real O
… O
Aren’t O
Are O
n’t O
they O
supposed O
to O
have O
a O
pot N
of O
gold N
or O
something O
? O

And O
they O
have O
to O
tell O
you H
where O
it O
is O
if O
you H
catch O
them O
? O
” O

“ O
That’s O
That O
’s H
leprechauns A
, O
idiot H
! O
” O
said O
the O
voice H
from O
my H
noise N
. O

“ O
So O
what’s O
what O
’s H
the O
difference N
? O

Just O
give O
us H
the O
gold N
and O
we’ll O
we H
’ll O
let O
you H
go O
… O
” O

“ O
We H
— O
? O
” O
I H
started O
. O

He O
winked O
at O
me H
. O

“ O
Oh O
, O
I’m O
I H
’m O
happy O
to O
stick N
around O
, O
” O
came O
the O
voice H
. O

“ O
It’s O
It O
’s H
noggins N
here O
who O
wants O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
me H
… O
” O

Suddenly O
I H
felt N
a O
violent O
pain N
in O
my H
nose N
, O
my H
eyes N
watered O
. O

“ O
Owwww O
! O
” O
I H
howled O
. O

“ O
See O
what O
I H
mean O
? O
” O
the O
voice H
shouted O
over O
my H
moans N
. O

“ O
Perhaps O
you H
can O
use H
it O
in O
exams N
… O
” O
Pete H
said O
, O
scratching O
his O
head N
. O

“ O
You H
know O
, O
it O
could O
tell O
us H
all O
the O
answers N
. O
” O

“ O
Idiot H
! O

If O
it O
yacks O
on O
like O
that O
in O
an O
exam N
, O
I’ll O
I H
’ll O
get O
thrown O
out H
. O

And O
probably O
locked O
up O
too O
. O
” O

“ O
Can’t O
Ca O
n’t O
it O
whisper O
? O
” O

“ O
Perhaps O
I H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
know O
the O
answers N
anyway O
? O
” O
said O
the O
voice H
. O

“ O
Have O
you H
thought O
of O
that O
? O
” O

“ O
Anyway O
, O
I H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
want O
it O
in O
exams N

I H
just O
want O
it O
to O
go O
. O

Out O
of O
my H
nose N

” O

“ O
Can’t O
Ca O
n’t O
you H
just O
poke O
it O
out H
? O
” O

“ O
With O
what O
? O
” O

“ O
S’pose O

you H
’ve O
already O
tried O
your H
finger N
… O
” O

“ O
Yes O
he O
has O

” O
the O
voice H
said O
. O

“ O
And O
it O
wasn’t O
was O
n’t O
pleasant O
I H
can O
tell O
you H

” O

“ O
You H

what O

’s H
like O
. O

He’s O
He O
’s H
already O
making O
sarcastic O
remarks N

” O

“ O
What O
if O

put O
something O
in O
your H
nose N

catch O
it O

then O
? O

I H

“ O
No O
! O
” O
we H
both O
said O
at O
once O
. O

“ O
Snap O
! O
” O
Pete H
said O
. O

“ O
You H
both O
said O
the O

thing N
at O
the O
same O
time N

you H

He O
hit O
his O
forehead N
with O
his O
palm A
. O

“ O
That’s O
That O
’s H
it O
! O

Three O
wishes O
! O

When O
you H
catch O
a O
fairy O
, O
you H
get O
three O
wishes O
. O

Hey O
you H
in O
there O
! O

Is O
that O
right O
? O
” O

“ O
You H
could O
see O
things N

that O
… O
” O
said O
the O
voice H
with O
resignation N

“ O
I H
wish O
you’d O
you H
’d O
get O
out H
of O
my H
nose N
, O
then O
! O
” O
I H
cried O
. O

In O
a O
flash N
the O
fairy O
was O
out H
of O
my H
nose N
and O
gone O
. O

And O
I’m O
I H
’m O
still O
waiting O
for O
my H
two O
other O
wishes O

THE O
END N

Something O
a O
little O
lighter O
this O
week N
, O
I H
hope O
you H
enjoy O
it O
. O

Once O
it O
got O
started O
, O
I H
realised O
that O
the O
idea N
must O
have O
been O
inspired O
by O
the O
title N
of O
Justine O
Larbalestier’s O
Larbalestier O
’s H
How O
to O
Ditch O
Your H
Fairy O
, O
although O
it O
has O
nothing N
at O
all O
to O
do O
with O
that O
story N
at O
all O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
my H
story N
feels O
very O
light N
. O

But O
I H
think O
I H
needed O
something O
a O
little O
less O
dark O
, O
and O
there O
are O
some O
quite O
sombre O
tales N
coming O
up O
in O
the O
coming O
weeks N
. O

See O
you H
then O
. O

The O
Further O
Vision O

“ O
I H
have O
already O
told O
you H
of O
the O
sickness N
and O
confusion N
that O
comes O
with O
time N
travelling O
. O

And O
this O
time N
I H
was O
not O
seated O
properly O
in O
the O
saddle N
, O
but O
sideways O
and O
in O
an O
unstable O
fashion N
. O

For O
an O
indefinite O
time N
I H
clung O
to O
the O
machine N
as O
it O
swayed O
and O
vibrated O
, O
quite O
unheeding O
how O
I H
went O
, O
and O
when O
I H
brought O
myself H
to O
look O
at O
the O
dials N
again O
I H
was O
amazed O
to O
find O
where O
I H
had O
arrived O
. O

One O
dial N
records N
days N
, O
and O
another O
records N
thousands N
of O
days N
, O
another O
records N
millions N
of O
days N
, O
and O
another O
records N
thousands N
of O
millions N
. O

Now O
, O
instead O
of O
reversing O
the O
levers N
, O
I H
had O
pulled O
them O
over O
so O
as O
to O
go O
forward O
with O
them O
, O
and O
when O
I H
came O
to O
look O
at O
these O
indicators N
I H
found O
that O
the O
thousands N
hand N
was O
sweeping O
round O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
seconds N
hand N
of O
a O
watch O
— O
into O
futurity N
. O

“ O
As O
I H
drove O
on O
, O
a O
peculiar O
change O
crept O
over O
the O
appearance N
of O
things N
. O

The O
palpitating O
greyness N
grew O
darker O
; O
then O
— O
though O
I H
was O
still O
travelling O
with O
prodigious O
velocity N
— O
the O
blinking O
succession N
of O
day N
and O
night N
, O
which O
was O
usually O
indicative O
of O
a O
slower O
pace N
, O
returned O
, O
and O
grew O
more O
and O
more O
marked O
. O

This O
puzzled O
me H
very O
much O
at O
first O
. O

The O
alternations N
of O
night N
and O
day N
grew O
slower O
and O
slower O
, O
and O
so O
did O
the O
passage N
of O
the O
sun N
across O
the O
sky O
, O
until O
they O
seemed O
to O
stretch O
through O
centuries N
. O

At O
last O
a O
steady O
twilight N
brooded O
over O
the O
earth N
, O
a O
twilight N
only O
broken O
now O
and O
then O
when O
a O
comet N
glared O
across O
the O
darkling O
sky O
. O

The O
band N
of O
light N
that O
had O
indicated O
the O
sun N
had O
long O
since O
disappeared O
; O
for O
the O
sun N
had O
ceased O
to O
set O
— O
it O
simply O
rose O
and O
fell O
in O
the O
west O
, O
and O
grew O
ever O
broader O
and O
more O
red O
. O

All O
trace N
of O
the O
moon N
had O
vanished O
. O

The O
circling O
of O
the O
stars N
, O
growing O
slower O
and O
slower O
, O
had O
given O
place N
to O
creeping O
points O
of O
light N
. O

At O
last O
, O
some O
time N
before O
I H
stopped O
, O
the O
sun N
, O
red O
and O
very O
large O
, O
halted O
motionless O
upon O
the O
horizon N
, O
a O
vast O
dome N
glowing O
with O
a O
dull O
heat N
, O
and O
now O
and O
then O
suffering N
a O
momentary O
extinction N
. O

At O
one N
time N
it O
had O
for O
a O
little O
while O
glowed O
more O
brilliantly O
again O
, O
but O
it O
speedily O
reverted O
to O
its O
sullen O
red O
heat N
. O

I H
perceived O
by O
this O
slowing N
down O
of O
its O
rising O
and O
setting N
that O
the O
work N
of O
the O
tidal O
drag N
was O
done O
. O

The O
earth N
had O
come O
to O
rest N
with O
one N
face N
to O
the O
sun N
, O
even O
as O
in O
our H
own O
time N
the O
moon N
faces N
the O
earth N
. O

Very O
cautiously O
, O
for O
I H
remembered O
my H
former O
headlong O
fall N
, O
I H
began O
to O
reverse O
my H
motion N
. O

Slower O
and O
slower O
went O
the O
circling O
hands N
until O
the O
thousands N
one N
seemed O
motionless O
and O
the O
daily O
one N
was O
no O
longer O
a O
mere O
mist N
upon O
its O
scale N
. O

Still O
slower O
, O
until O
the O
dim O
outlines O
of O
a O
desolate O
beach N
grew O
visible O
. O

“ O
I H
stopped O
very O
gently O
and O
sat O
upon O
the O
Time N
Machine O
, O
looking O
round O
. O

The O
sky O
was O
no O
longer O
blue O
. O

North H
- O
eastward O
it O
was O
inky O
black O
, O
and O
out H
of O
the O
blackness N
shone O
brightly O
and O
steadily O
the O
pale O
white O
stars N
. O

Overhead O
it O
was O
a O
deep O
Indian O
red O
and O
starless O
, O
and O
south O
- O
eastward O
it O
grew O
brighter O
to O
a O
glowing O
scarlet N
where O
, O
cut O
by O
the O
horizon N
, O
lay O
the O
huge O
hull N
of O
the O
sun N
, O
red O
and O
motionless O
. O

The O
rocks N
about O
me H
were O
of O
a O
harsh O
reddish O
colour N
, O
and O
all O
the O
trace N
of O
life N
that O
I H
could O
see O
at O
first O
was O
the O
intensely O
green O
vegetation N
that O
covered O
every O
projecting O
point N
on O
their O
south O
- O
eastern O
face N
. O

It O
was O
the O
same O
rich O
green O
that O
one N
sees O
on O
forest N
moss A
or O
on O
the O
lichen N
in O
caves N
: O
plants A
which O
like O
these O
grow O
in O
a O
perpetual O
twilight N
. O

“ O
The O
machine N
was O
standing N
on O
a O
sloping O
beach N
. O

The O
sea N
stretched O
away O
to O
the O
south O
- O
west O
, O
to O
rise N
into O
a O
sharp O
bright O
horizon N
against O
the O
wan O
sky O
. O

There O
were O
no O
breakers N
and O
no O
waves N
, O
for O
not O
a O
breath N
of O
wind N
was O
stirring O
. O

Only O
a O
slight O
oily O
swell N
rose O
and O
fell O
like O
a O
gentle O
breathing N
, O
and O
showed O
that O
the O
eternal O
sea N
was O
still O
moving O
and O
living O
. O

And O
along O
the O
margin N
where O
the O
water N
sometimes O
broke O
was O
a O
thick O
incrustation N
of O
salt N
— O
pink O
under O
the O
lurid O
sky O
. O

There O
was O
a O
sense N
of O
oppression N
in O
my H
head N
, O
and O
I H
noticed O
that O
I H
was O
breathing N
very O
fast O
. O

The O
sensation N
reminded O
me H
of O
my H
only O
experience N
of O
mountaineering N
, O
and O
from O
that O
I H
judged O
the O
air N
to O
be O
more O
rarefied O
than O
it O
is O
now O
. O

“ O
Far O
away O
up O
the O
desolate O
slope N
I H
heard O
a O
harsh O
scream N
, O
and O
saw O
a O
thing N
like O
a O
huge O
white O
butterfly A
go O
slanting O
and O
fluttering O
up O
into O
the O
sky O
and O
, O
circling O
, O
disappear O
over O
some O
low O
hillocks N
beyond O
. O

The O
sound N
of O
its O
voice H
was O
so O
dismal O
that O
I H
shivered O
and O
seated O
myself H
more O
firmly O
upon O
the O
machine N
. O

Looking O
round O
me H
again O
, O
I H
saw O
that O
, O
quite O
near O
, O
what O
I H
had O
taken O
to O
be O
a O
reddish O
mass O
of O
rock N
was O
moving O
slowly O
towards O
me H
. O

Then O
I H
saw O
the O
thing N
was O
really O
a O
monstrous O
crab A
- O
like O
creature A
. O

Can O
you H
imagine O
a O
crab A
as O
large O
as O
yonder O
table N
, O
with O
its O
many O
legs N
moving O
slowly O
and O
uncertainly O
, O
its O
big O
claws N
swaying O
, O
its O
long O
antennæ N
, O
like O
carters’ O
carters H
’ O
whips N
, O
waving O
and O
feeling O
, O
and O
its O
stalked O
eyes N
gleaming O
at O
you H
on O
either O
side N
of O
its O
metallic O
front N
? O

Its O
back O
was O
corrugated O
and O
ornamented O
with O
ungainly O
bosses H
, O
and O
a O
greenish O
incrustation N
blotched O
it O
here O
and O
there O
. O

I H
could O
see O
the O
many O
palps O
of O
its O
complicated O
mouth N
flickering O
and O
feeling O
as O
it O
moved O
. O

The O
Cost O
to O
Be O
Wise O

Veronique O
stayed O
with O
me H
that O
night N
, O
lying O
next O
to O
me H
in O
my H
blankets N
and O
furs N
. O

She O
didn't O
did O
n't O
sleep O
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
think O
. O

I H
was O
listening O
to O
her O
breath N
. O

I H
felt N
as O
if O
I H
should O
help O
her O
sleep O
. O

I H
lay O
there O
and O
tried O
to O
think O
if O
I H
should O
put O
my H
arm N
around O
her O
, O
but O
I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
know O
. O

Maybe O
she O
didn't O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
touched O
. O

And O
she O
had O
been O
a O
stupid O
girl H
, O
anyway O
. O

She O
lay O
tense O
in O
the O
dark O
. O

" O
Are O
you H
going O
to O
be O
a O
teacher H
? O
" O
I H
asked O
. O

She O
laughed O
. O

" O
If O
I H
get O
out H
of O
here O
. O
" O

I H
waited O
for O
her O
to O
say O
more O
, O
but O
she O
didn't O
did O
n't O
. O

" O
Get O
out H
of O
here O
" O
meant O
to O
make O
someone H
leave O
. O

Maybe O
she O
meant O
if O
she O
made O
herself O
. O

" O
You H
come O
here O
from O
Earth O
? O
" O
I H
asked O
. O

To O
get O
her O
to O
talk O
, O
although O
I H
was O
tired O
of O
lingua N
and O
I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
really O
want O
to O
think O
about O
anything O
. O

" O
My H
family H
came O
here O
from O
Earth O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O

" O
Why O
? O
" O

" O
My H
father H
, O
he's O
he O
's H
an O
anthropologist H
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O

" O
Do O
you H
know O
anthropologist H
? O
" O

" O
No O
, O
" O
I H
said O
. O

" O
He O
is O
a O
person H
who O
studies N
the O
way N
people N
live O
. O

And O
he O
is O
a O
teacher H
. O
" O

All O
the O
offworlders O
I H
had O
ever O
met O
were O
teachers H
. O

I H
wondered O
who O
did O
all O
the O
work N
on O
Earth O
. O

" O
Because O
Earth O
had O
lost O
touch O
with O
your H
world N
, O
the O
people N
here O
are O
very O
interesting O
to O
my H
father H
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O

Her O
voice H
was O
listless O
in O
the O
dark O
and O
she O
was O
even O
harder O
to O
understand O
when O
I H
couldn't O
could O
n't O
see O
her O
properly O
. O

I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
understand O
so O
I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
say O
anything O
. O

I H
was O
sorry O
I'd O
I H
'd O
started O
her O
talking O
. O

" O
History N
, O
do O
you H
know O
the O
word N
' O
history N
' O
? O
" O
she O
asked O
. O

Of O
course N
I H
knew O
the O
word N
" O
history N
. O
" O

" O
I H
study O
history N
in O
school N
, O
" O
I H
said O
. O

Anneal O
and O
Kumar H
taught O
it O
. O

" O
Do O
you H
know O
the O
history N
of O
this O
world N
? O
" O

It O
took O
my H
tired O
head N
a O
long O
time N
to O
sort N
that O
out H
. O

" O
Yes O
, O
" O
I H
said O
. O

" O
We H
are O
a O
colony N
. O

People N
from O
Earth O
come O
here O
to O

. O

Then O
there O
is O
a O
big O
problem N
on O
Earth O

and O
the O
people N

We H
forget O
we H

Then O
Earth O
finds O
us H
again O
. O
" O

" O
Some O
people N
have O
stories N
about O
coming O
from O
the O
Earth O
, O
" O
Veronique O
said O
. O

" O
My H
father H
is O
collecting O
those O
stories N
from O
different O
peoples N
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
a O
graduate H
student H
. O
" O

The O
clans H
didn't O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
stories N
about O
coming O
from O
Earth O
. O

We H
said O
the O
first O
people N
came O
out H
of O
the O
sun N
. O

This O
somehow O
seemed O
embarrassing O
. O

I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
understand O
what O
kind N
of O
student H
she O
was O
. O

" O
Are O
you H
here O
for O
stories N
? O
" O
I H
asked O
. O

" O
No O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O

" O
Ian H
is O
old O
friends H
with O
your H
teacher H
, O
from O
back O
when O
they O
were O
both O
with O
the O
survey N
. O

We H
just O
came O
to O
visit O
. O
" O

I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
understand O
what O
she'd O
she O
'd O
said O
except O
that O
they O
were O
visiting O
. O

We H
were O
quiet N
after O
that O
. O

I H
pretended O
to O
sleep O
. O

Sometimes O
there O
was O
gunfire N
outside O
and O
we H
jumped O
, O
even O
Mam O
on O
the O
bed N
. O

Everyone O
but O
Bet H
. O

Once O
Bet H
was O
asleep O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
wake O
her O
up O
. O

I H
fell O
asleep O
thinking O
about O
how O
I H
wished O
that O
the O
Scathalos O
outrunners O
were O
gone O
. O

I H
dreamed O
that O
I H
was O
at O
the O
offworlder's O
offworlder O
's H
home N

where O
it O
was O
summer N

no O
one N
was O
taking O
care N

the O
stabros O
, O
and O
they O
were O
all O
glad O
, O
and O
so O
I H
was O
a O
hero H
- O
and O
I H
was O
startled O
awake O
by O
gunfire N
. O

Just O
more O
drinking O
and O
shooting N
. O

I H
wished O
my H
da O
would O
come O
home N

It O
didn't O
did O
n't O
seem O
fair O
that O
we H
should O
lie O

Introduction N

I H

The O
Chemical O
Wedding O
by O
Christian H
Rosencreutz O
is O
the O
way N
I’ve O
I H
’ve O
decided O
to O
present N
the O
title N
of O
this O
book O
. O

Most O
versions N
in O
English O
are O
called O
The O
Chemical O
Wedding O
of O
Christian H
Rosencreutz O
, O
which O
suggests O
( O
and O
most O
people N
who’ve O
who O
’ve O
heard O
of O
it O
suppose O
) O
that O
the O
wedding N
is O
Christian’s O
Christian H
’s H
. O

It’s O
It O
’s H
not O
; O
Christian H
Rosencreutz O
is O
the O
purported O
author H
of O
a O
book O
called O
The O
Chemical O
Wedding O
. O

The O
actual O
author H
is O
Johann H
Valentin O
Andreae O
, O
whose O
name N
didn’t O
did O
n’t O
appear O
on O
the O
book O
originally O
, O
thus O
ensuring O
the O
confusion N
. O

I’ll O
I H
’ll O
call O
it O
herein O
( O
as O
everyone O
mostly O
does O
) O
simply O
The O
Chemical O
Wedding O
. O

Though O
its O
original O
readers H
would O
have O
had O
a O
certain O
amount N
of O
context N
for O
the O
truly O
bizarre O
and O
surprising O
events N
it O
tells O
of O
, O
it’s O
it O
’s H
possible O
that O
The O
Chemical O
Wedding O
is O
now O
more O
enjoyable O
without O
knowing O
that O
context N
, O
and O
experiencing O
the O
book O
unmediated O
. O

You H
might O
therefore O
wish O
to O
start O
right O
in O
on O
the O
first O
page N
of O
text N
that O
follows O
and O
only O
then O
return O
to O
this O
introduction N
. O

Consider O
a O
similar O
case N
: O
a O
little O
book O
published O
in O
1934 O
by O
the O
Surrealist O
artist H
Max H
Ernst H
called O
Une O
Semaine O
de O
Bonté O
. O

It O
was O
made O
entirely O
of O
collaged O
illustrations N
cut O
out H
of O
old O
books N

The O
First O
Day H

It O
was O
just O
before O
Easter O
Sunday O
, O
1 O
and O
I H
was O
sitting O
at O
my H
table N
. O

I’d O
I H
’d O
said O
my H
prayers N
, O
talking O
a O
long O
time N
as O
usual O
with O
my H
Maker O
and O
thinking O
about O
some O
of O
the O
great O
mysteries N
the O
Father H
of O
Lights O
had O
revealed O
to O
me H
. O

Now O
I H
was O
ready O
to O
make O
and O
to O
bake O
– O
only O
in O
my H
heart N
, O
actually O
– O
a O
small O
, O
perfect O
unleavened O
wafer N
to O
eat O
with O
my H
beloved O
Paschal O
Lamb H
. O

All O
of O
a O
sudden O
a O
terrible O
wind N
blew O
up O
, O
so O
strong O
that O
I H
thought O
the O
hill N
my H
little O
house N
was O
built O
on O
would O
be O
blown O
apart O
– O
but O
I’d O
I H
’d O
seen O
the O
Devil H
do O
things N
as O
bad O
as O
this O
before O
( O
the O
Devil H
had O
often O
tried O
to O
harm O
me H
) O
, O
so O
I H
took O
heart N
and O
went O
on O
meditating O
. O

Till O
I H
felt N
somebody H
touch O
me H
on O
the O
back O
. O

This O
frightened O
me H
so O
that O
I H
didn’t O
did O
n’t O
dare O
turn O
. O

I H
tried O
to O
stay O
as O
brave O
and O
calm O
as O
a O
human O
being O
could O
under O
the O
circumstances N
. O

I H
felt N
my H
coat N
tugged O
at O
, O
and O
tugged O
again O
, O
and O
at O
last O
I H
looked O
around O
. O

A H
woman H
stood O
there O
, O
so O
bright O
and O
beautiful O
, O
in O
a O
sky O
- O
colored O
robe N
– O
a O
heavens N
covered O
with O

1 O
Christian’s O
Christian H
’s H
story N
begins O
just O
before O
Easter O
, O
like O
Dante’s O
Dante H
’s H
Divine O
Comedy N
. O

It O
can O
be O
seen O
as O
an O
allegory N
of O
Christ’s O
Christ H
’s H
death N
and O
resurrection N
, O
though O
this O
idea N
produces O
some O
puzzles N
. O

The O
birds A
sang O
so O
beautifully O
, O
the O
young O
deer A
skipped O
so O
happily O
, O
that O
it O
gladdened O
my H
old O
heart N
, O
and O
I H
couldn't O
could O
n't O
help O
singing O
too O
... O

THE O
FOURTH O
DAY N

I H
was O
awake O
and O
lying O
in O
bed N
next O
morning N
, O
looking O
idly O
at O
the O
wonderful O
images N
and O
inscriptions N
all O
around O
my H
room N
, O
when O
suddenly O
I H
heard O
the O
sound N
of O
trumpets N
, O
as O
if O
a O
procession N
were O
already O
underway O
. O

My H
page N
jumped O
out H
of O
bed N
as O
if O
crazed O
, O
looking O
more O
dead O
than O
alive O
, O
and O
you H
can O
imagine O
how O
I H
felt N
when O
he O
cried O
, O
“ O
They're O
They O
're O
already O
being O
presented O
to O
the O
king H
! O
" O

I H
could O
only O
groan O
in O
frustration N
and O
curse O
my H
lazy O
bones N
. O

I H
got O
dressed O
, O
but O
my H
page N
was O
quicker O
than O
I H
was O
and O
ran O
out H
of O
the O
chamber N
to O
see O
what O
was O
what O
. O

He O
soon O
came O
back O
and O
gave O
me H
the O
good O
news N
that O
I H
actually O
hadn’t O
had O
n’t O
overslept O
; O
all O
I’d O
I H
’d O
done O
was O
miss O
breakfast N
: O
they O
hadn’t O
had O
n’t O
wanted O
to O
wake O
an O
old O
man H
who O
needed O
his O
rest N
. O

But O
now O
I H
had O
to O
get O
ready O
to O
go O
with O
him O
to O
the O
lion A
fountain N
, O
where O
most O
of O
the O
others O
were O
gathered O
. O

Such O
a O
relief N
! O

My H
spirits N
recovered O
, O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
I H
had O
got O
into O
my H
habit N
, O
I H
followed O
him O
to O
the O
garden N
I H
have O
already O
told O
about O
. O

I H
found O
that O
the O
lion A
, O
in O
place N
of O
his O
sword N
, O
now O
held O
a O
rather O
large O
plaque N
. O

Examining O
this O
, O
I H
could O
tell O
that O
it O
had O
been O
taken O
from O
those O
ancient O
monuments N
I’d O
I H
’d O
seen O
and O
put O
here O
for O
some O
special O
reason N
. O

The O
inscription N
on O
it O
was O
fading O
away O
, O
so O
I H
should O
set O
it O
down O
here O
as O
it O
was O
then O
, O
and O
ask O
my H
readers H
to O
ponder O
it O
: O

Prince H
Hermes O
: O
Now O
after O
humankind N
has O
suffered O
so O
much O
harm O
here O
I H
flow N
having O
by O
god’s O
god A
’s H
counsel H
and O
with O
the O
help O
of O
art N
become O
a O
healing O
balm N
. O

Drink O
from O
me H
if O
you H
can O
; O
wash O
, O
if O
you H
like O
; O
trouble N
my H
waters N
if O
you H
dare O
. O

Drink O

Some O
ants A
were O
infected O
with O
Beauveria O

Infected O
ants A
chose O
food N
laced O
with O
toxic O
hydrogen N

healthy O
ants A
avoided O
it O

What O
first O
attracted O
you H
to O
researching O
ants A
? O

Me H
and O
a O
studymate O
were O
keeping N
a O
lot N
of O
animals A
during O
our H
studies N
, O
from O
beetles A
, O
to O
butterflies A
and O
mantids A
, O
to O
ants A
. O

We H
had O
the O
ants A
in O
an O
observation N
nest N
, O
and O
I H
could O
just O
look O
at O
them O
for O
hours N
, O
watching O
them O
go O
about O
. O

This O
was O
in O
my H
third O
year N
of O
Biology N
study O
I H
think O
. O

After O
a O
while O
I H
needed O
to O
start O
thinking O
about O
an O
internship N
for O
my H
M.Sc. O
studies N
, O
and O
decided O
to O
write O
a O
couple N
of O
professors H
. O

I H
ended O
up O
going O
to O
the O
Centre N
for O
Social O
Evolution O
at O
the O
University N
of O
Copenhagen O
where O
I H
did O
a O
project N
on O
learning O
in O
Ants A
under O
supervision N
of O
Prof. O
Patrizia O
d'Ettorre O
. O

I H
liked O
it O
so O
much O
there O
I H
ended O
up O
doing O
a O
PhD N
and O
I've O
I H
've O
been O
working O
on O
social O
insects A
ever O
since O
. O

What O
methods N
and O
equipment N
were O
used O
for O
this O
investigation N
? O

This O
is O
a O
fun O
one N
. O

I H
try O
to O
work N
on O
a O
very O
low O
budget N
, O
and O
like O
to O
build O
most O
of O
the O
experimental O
setups N
myself H
( O
we H
actually O
have O
equipment N
in O
the O
lab N
nicknamed O
the O
' O
Nickinator O
' O
, O
' O
i-Nick O
' O
and O
the O
' O
Nicktendo64 O
' O
) O
. O

There's O
There O
's H
not O
that O
much O
money N
in O
fundamental O
science N
at O
the O
moment N
, O
so O
I H
try O
to O
cut O
the O
costs O
wherever O
possible O
. O

We H
collected O
wild O
colonies N
of O
Formica O
fusca O
by O
searching O
through O
old O
tree A
- O
trunks N
in O
old O
logging O
sites N
in O
southern O
Finland O
. O

We H
then O
housed O
the O
ants A
in O
nests N
I H
made O
using O
Y O
- O
tong O
[ O
aerated O
concrete O
] O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
very O
soft O
stone N
that O
you H
can O
easily O
carve O
. O

We H
carved O
out H
little O
squares N
for O
the O
ants A
to O
live O
in O
( O
covered O
with O
old O
CD N
covers O
to O
prevent O
them O
escaping O
! O
) O
. O

We H
then O
drilled O
a O
tunnel N
to O
a O
pot N
( O
the O
foraging N
arena N
) O
, O
where O
the O
ants A
got O
the O
choice N
between O
the O
food N
with O
medicine N
and O
the O
food N
without O
. O

We H
infected O
the O
ants A
by O
preparing O
a O
solution N
of O
the O
fungus A
Beauveria O
bassiana O
. O

Afterwards O
, O
each O
ant O
was O
dipped O
in O
the O
solution N
for O
a O
couple N
of O
seconds N
, O
dried O
on O
a O
cloth N
and O
put O
in O
the O
nest N
. O

After O
exposing O
the O
ants A
to O
the O
fungus A
, O
we H
took O
pictures N
of O
each O
foraging N
arena N
three O
times N
per O
day N
, O
and O
counted O
how O
many O
ants A
were O
present N
on O
each O
food N
- O
source N
. O

Example N
of O
aerated O
concrete O
, O
which O
provided O
a O
home N
for O
the O
subjects N
. O

Image N
: O
Marco H
Bernardini O
. O

This O
gave O
us H
the O
data N
that O
ants A
choose O
more O
medicine N
after O
they O
have O
been O
infected O
. O

The O
result N
that O
healthy O
ants A
die O
sooner O
when O
ingesting O
ROS O
[ O
Reactive O
Oxygen N
Species O
, O
the O
group N
of O
chemicals N
that O
includes O
hydrogen N
peroxide N
] O
but O
infected O
ants A
die O
less O
was O
obtained O
in O
another O
way N
( O
as O
you H
have O
to O
' O
force N
feed O
' O
the O
ROS O
, O
as O
healthy O
ants A
, O
when O
given O
the O
choice N
, O
ignore O
that O
food N
- O
source N
. O
) O

For O
this O
we H
basically O
put O
colonies N
on O
a O
diet N
of O
either O
food N
with O
medicine N
or O
without O
for O
a O
while O
. O

And O
afterwards O
either O
infected O
them O
or O
not O
. O

Then O
for O
about O
two O
weeks N
we H
count O
every O
day N
how O
many O
ants A
died O
. O

This O
gives O
us H
the O
data N
to O
do O
a O
so O
- O
called O
survival N
analysis N
. O

We H
measured O
the O
ROS O
- O
concentration N
in O
the O
bodies N
of O
ants A
after O
they O
ingested O
the O
food N
with O
the O
medicine N
using O
a O
spectrophotometer N
. O

By O
adding O
certain O
chemicals N
, O
the O
ROS O
can O
be O
measured O
using O
the O
emission N
of O
light N
of O
a O
certain O
wave N
- O
length N
. O

The O
detrimental O
effect N
of O
ROS O
on O
spores N
was O
easy O
to O
measure N
. O

We H
mixed O
different O
concentrations N
of O
ROS O
with O
the O
spores N
, O
plated O
them O
out H
on O
petri O
dishes N
with O
an O
agar N
- O
solution N
where O
fungus A
can O
grow O
on O
. O

A H
day N
after O
, O
we H
counted O
how O
many O
spores N
were O
still O
alive O
. O

How O
reliable O
do O
you H
consider O
your H
results N
to O
be O
? O

The O
results N
we H
got O
are O
very O
reliable O
. O

We H
had O
a O
lot N
of O
colonies N
containing O
a O
lot N
of O
ants A
, O
and O
wherever O
possible O
we H
conducted O
the O
experiment O
blind O
. O

This O
means N
the O
experimenter H
doesn't O
does O
n't O
know O
which O
ants A
belong O
to O
which O
treatment N
, O
so O
it's O
it O
's H
impossible O
to O
influence N
the O
results N
with O
' O
observer H
bias N
' O
. O

However O
, O
of O
course N
this O
is O
proof N
in O
just O
one N
species A
. O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
extrapolate O
to O
other O
ants A
, O
as O
different O
species A
lead O
very O
different O
lives O
. O

what O
its O
future N
looks O
like O
in O
the O
world N
of O
entertainment N
. O

For O
how O
long O
have O
you H
been O
involved O
in O
performing N
/ O
studying O
magic N
? O

Over O
50 O
years N
. O

I H
am O
61 O
now O
so O
I H
really O
started O
when O
I H
was O
about O
10 O
years N
old O
even O
though O
I H
had O
seen O
and O
worked O
with O
some O
basic O
tricks N
a O
few O
years N
earlier O
. O

I H
remember O
going O
into O
Hollywood O
Magic O
and O
wanting O
that O
big O
red O
box N
with O
the O
dragons A
on O
it O
and O
I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
even O
know O
what O
it O
did O
. O

The O
magician H
behind O
the O
counter N
was O
wise O
enough O
not O
to O
sell O
it O
to O
me H
, O
but O
instead O
sold O
me H
two O
books N
which O
I H
still O
own O
today N
- O
" O
Scarne O
on O
Card O
Tricks O
" O
and O
" O
Scarne O
on O
Magic O
Tricks O
" O
. O

That O
started O
me H
out H
on O
books N
and O
I H
have O
amassed O
quite O
a O
few O
since O
then O
. O

My H
major O
influences N
on O
performance N
are O
Eugene H
Burger H
and O
Michael H
Skinner H
. O

October O
is O
National O
Magic O
Month O
in O
the O
US O
. O

Do O
you H
think O
magic N
is O
alive O
as O
a O
viable O
form N
of O
entertainment N
today N
? O

Absolutely O
. O

There O
are O
more O
magicians H
working O
today N
than O
ever O
before O
. O

There O
will O
always O
be O
an O
audience N
for O
good O
magicians H
doing O
good O
magic N
. O

Has O
the O
internet N
helped O
or O
hurt O
magic N
? O

Both O
. O

I H
think O
it O
has O
helped O
draw O
younger O
people N
to O
magic N
as O
a O
hobby N
, O
but O
I H
think O
it O
has O
hurt O
the O
ability N
of O
young O
magicians H
to O
think O
because O
so O
many O
rely O
on O
the O
internet N
for O
everything O
and O
they O
aren't O
are O
n't O
reading O
the O
books N
. O

We H
have O
to O
have O
knowledge N
of O
the O
history N
of O
magic N
and O
what O
has O
been O
done O
before O
. O

Moreover O
, O
seeing O
someone H
perform O
on O
the O
internet N
takes O
away O
the O
use H
of O
our H
senses N
, O
originality N
and O
imagination N
that O
reading O
and O
thinking O
about O
magic N
can O
produce O
. O

Anyone O
can O
become O
a O
monkey A
; O
it O
takes O
serious O
study O
to O
become O
a O
magician H
. O

Do O
you H
travel O
much O
in O
your H
current O
role N
? O

Yes O
, O
I H
am O
traveling O
quite O
a O
bit N
. O

I H
was O

sat O
down O
with O
Michael H
Dranove O
for O
an O
interview N
in O
his O
MIT O
office N
in O
Cambridge O
, O
Massachusetts O
. O

On O
NATO O

I H
just O
wanted O
to O
know O
if O
you H
had O
any O
thoughts N
on O
recent O
NATO O
actions N
and O
the O
protests N
coming O
up O
at O
the O
60th O
NATO O
conference N
, O
I H
know O
you’re O
you H
’re O
speaking O
at O
the O
counter-conference O
. O

Could O
be O
I H
give O
so O
many O
talks N
I H
can’t O
ca O
n’t O
remember O
. O

On O
the O
NATO O
conference N
, O
well O
I H
mean O
the O
obvious O
question N
is O
why O
should O
NATO O
exist O
? O

In O
fact N
you H
can O
ask O
questions N
about O
why O
it O
should O
ever O
have O
existed O
, O
but O
now O
why O
should O
it O
exist O
. O

I H
mean O
the O
theory N
was O
, O
whether O
you H
believe O
it O
or O
not O
, O
that O
it O
would O
be O
a O
defensive O
alliance N
against O
potential N
Soviet O
aggression N
, O
that’s O
that O
’s H
the O
basic O
doctrine N
. O

Well O
there’s O
there O
’s H
no O
defense N
against O
Soviet O
aggression N
, O
so O
whether O
you H
believe O
that O
doctrine N
or O
not O
that’s O
that O
’s H
gone O
. O

When O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
collapsed O
there O
had O
been O
an O
agreement N
, O
a O
recent O
agreement N
, O
between O
Gorbachev O
and O
the O
U.S O
government N
and O
the O
first O
Bush H
administration N
. O

The O
agreement N
was O
that O
Gorbachev O
agreed O
to O
a O
quite O
remarkable O
concession N
: O
he O
agreed O
to O
let O
a O
united O
Germany H
join O
the O
NATO O
military O
alliance N
. O

Now O
it O
is O
remarkable O
in O
the O
light N
of O
history N
, O
the O
history N
of O
the O
past N
century N
, O
Germany H
alone O
had O
virtually O
destroyed O
Russia O
, O
twice O
, O
and O
Germany H
backed O
by O
a O
hostile O
military O
alliance N
, O
centered O
in O
the O
most O
phenomenal O
military O
power N
in O
history N
, O
that’s O
that O
’s H
a O
real O
threat N
. O

Nevertheless O
he O
agreed O
, O
but O
there O
was O
a O
quid O
pro O
quo O
, O
namely O
that O
NATO O
should O
not O
expand O
to O
the O
east O
, O
so O
Russia O
would O
at O
least O
have O
a O
kind N
of O
security N
zone N
. O

And O
George H
Bush H
and O
James H
Baker H
, O
secretary H
of O
state N
, O
agreed O
that O
NATO O
would O
not O
expand O
one N
inch N
to O
the O
east O
. O

Gorbachev O
also O
proposed O
a O
nuclear O
free O
weapons N
zone N
in O
the O
region N
, O
but O
the O
U.S O
wouldn’t O
would O
n’t O
consider O
that O
. O

Okay O
, O
so O
that O
was O
the O
basis N
on O
which O
then O
shortly O
after O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
collapsed O
. O

Well O
, O
Clinton H
came O
into O
office N
what O
did O
he O
do O
? O

Well O
one N
of O
the O
first O
things N
he O
did O
was O
to O
back O
down O
on O
the O
promise N
of O
not O
expanding O
NATO O
to O
the O
east O
. O

Well O
that’s O
that O
’s H
a O
significant O
threat N
to O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
, O
to O
Russia O
now O
that O
there O
was O
no O
longer O
any O
Soviet O
Union O
, O
it O
was O
a O
significant O
threat N
to O
Russia O
and O
not O
surprisingly O
they O
responded O
by O
beefing O
up O
their O
offensive O
capacity N
, O
not O
much O
but O
some O
. O

So O
they O
rescinded O
their O
pledge N
not O
to O
use H
nuclear O
weapons N
on O
first O
strike N
, O
NATO O
had O
never O
rescinded O
it O
, O
but O
they O
had O
and O
started O
some O
remilitarization N
. O

With O
Bush H
, O
the O
aggressive O
militarism N
of O
the O
Bush H
administration N
, O
as O
predicted O
, O
induced O
Russia O
to O
extend O
further O
its O
offensive O
military O
capacity N
; O
it’s O
it O
’s H
still O
going O
on O
right O
now O
. O

When O
Bush H
proposed O
the O
missile N
defense N
systems N
in O
Eastern O
Europe O
, O
Poland O
and O
Czechoslovakia O
, O
it O
was O
a O
real O
provocation N
to O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
. O

I H
mean O
that O
was O
discussed O
in O
U.S O
arms N
control N
journals N
, O
that O
they O
would O
have O
to O
regard N
as O
a O
potential N
threat N
to O
their O
strategic O
deterrent N
, O
meaning N
as O
a O
first O
strike N
weapon N
. O

And O
the O
claim O
was O
that O
it O
had O
to O
do O
with O
Iranian O
missiles N
, O
but O
forget O
about O
that O
. O

Take O
say O
on O
Obama H
, O
Obama’s O
Obama H
’s H
national O
security N
advisor H
James H
Jones H
former O
Marine O
commandant H
is O
on O
record N
of O
favoring O
expansion N
of O
NATO O
to O
the O
south O
and O
the O
east O
, O
further O
expansion N
of O
NATO O
, O
and O
also O
making O
it O
an O
intervention N
force N
. O

And O
the O
head N
of O
NATO O
, O
Hoop O
Scheffer O
, O
he O
has O
explained O
that O
NATO O
must O
take O
on O
responsibility N
for O
ensuring O
the O
security N
of O
pipelines N
and O
sea N
lanes N
, O
that O
is O
NATO O
must O
be O
a O
guarantor H
of O
energy N
supplies N
for O
the O
West O
. O

Well O
that’s O
that O
’s H
kind N
of O
an O
unending O
war N
, O
so O
do O
we H
want O
NATO O
to O
exist O
, O
do O
we H
want O
there O
to O
be O
a O
Western O
military O
alliance N
that O
carries O
out H
these O
activities N
, O
with O
no O
pretense N
of O
defense N
? O

Well O
I H
think O
that’s O
that O
’s H
a O
pretty O
good O
question N
; O
I H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
see O
why O
it O
should O
, O
I H
mean O
there O
happens O
to O
be O
no O
other O
military O
alliance N
remotely O
comparable O
— O
if O
there O
happened O
to O
be O
one N
I’d O
I H
’d O
be O
opposed O
to O
that O
too O
. O

So O
I H
think O
the O
first O
question N
is O
, O
what O
is O
this O
all O
about O
, O
why O
should O
we H
even O
be O
debating O
NATO O
, O
is O
there O
any O
reason N
why O
it O
should O
exist O
? O

Labor N
actions N
as O
a O
revival N
of O
the O
Left O

We’ve O
We H
’ve O
seen O
mass O
strikes O
all O
around O
the O
world N
, O
in O
countries N
that O
we H
wouldn’t O
would O
n’t O
expect O
it O
. O

Do O
you H
think O
this O
is O
a O
revival N
of O
the O
Left O
in O
the O
West O
? O

Or O
do O
you H
think O
it’s O
it O
’s H
nothing N
? O

It’s O
It O
’s H
really O
hard O
to O
tell O
. O

I H
mean O
there’s O
there O
’s H
certainly O
signs N
of O
it O
, O
and O
in O
the O
United O
States O
too O
, O
in O
fact N
we H
had O
a O
sit O
down O
strike N
in O
the O
United O
States O
not O
long O
ago O
, O
which O
is O
a O
very O
militant O
labor N
action N
. O

Sit O
down O
strikes O
which O
began O
at O
a O
significant O
level N
in O
the O
1930’s O
were O
very O
threatening O
to O
management N
and O
ownership N
, O
because O
the O
sit O
down O
strike N
is O
one N
step O
before O
workers H
taking O
over O
the O
factory N
and O
running O
it O
and O
kicking O
out H
the O
management N
, O
and O
probably O
doing O
a O
better O
job N
. O

So O
that’s O
that O
’s H
a O
frightening O
idea N
, O
and O
police N
were O
called O
in O
and O
so O
on O
. O

Well O
we H
just O
had O
one N
in O
the O
United O
States O
at O
the O
Republic O
Windows O
and O
Doors O
Factory O
, O
it’s O
it O
’s H
hard O
to O
know O
, O
I H
mean O
these O
things N
are O
just O
hard O
to O
predict O
, O
they O
may O
take O
off O
, O
and O
they O
may O
take O
on O
a O
broader O
scope N
, O
they O
may O
fizzle O
away O
or O
be O
diverted O
. O

Interview O

What O
inspired O
you H
to O
create O
a O
cocktail N
after O
the O
santorum O
neologism N
? O

Santorum O
the O
person H
has O
been O
in O
the O
news N
throughout O
the O
primary O
season N
, O
and O
we H
thought O
it O
would O
be O
interesting O
to O
try O
to O
create O
a O
delicious O
drink N
that O
mimicked O
the O
appearance N
of O
the O
Dan H
Savage H
meaning N
of O
" O
santorum O
. O
" O

How O
did O
you H
first O
hear O
about O
the O
definition N
of O
the O
santorum O
neologism N
that O
grew O
out H
of O
the O
contest N
from O
the O
Savage H
Love N
advice N
column N
? O

We H
don't O
do O
n't O
really O
remember O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
been O
around O
forever O
. O

Probably O
read O
about O
it O
somewhere O
. O

What O
are O
your H
thoughts N
about O
Rick H
Santorum’s O
Santorum O
’s H
views N
on O
gay O
rights N
? O

It's O
It O
's H
not O
for O
us H
to O
take O
a O
stand O
on O
any O
political O
issues N
. O

We'll O
We H
'll O
leave O
that O
to O
the O
professionals H
. O

Do O
you H
think O
it O
was O
an O
appropriate O
form N
of O
satire N
for O
Dan H
Savage H
to O
popularize O
the O
definition N
of O
the O
santorum O
neologism N
created O
in O
his O
advice N
column N
? O

We H
thought O
it O
was O
funny O
. O

Whether O
it O
is O
appropriate O
or O
not O
is O
another O
thing N
we H
leave O
to O
the O
pros H
to O
decide O
. O

When O
was O
the O
Santorum O
cocktail N
first O
created O
? O

A H
few O
months N
ago O
. O

What O
ingredients N
go O
in O
the O
Santorum O
cocktail N
? O

Bailey's O
Bailey H
's H
, O
orange N
vodka N
, O
bitters N
, O
and O
chocolate N
flakes N
. O

How O
is O
the O
Santorum O
drink N
made O
? O

The O
ingredients N
are O
shaken O
and O
/ O
or O
poured O
into O
a O
cocktail N
glass N
. O

See O
the O
pictures N
. O

Your H
Santorum O
cocktail N
creation N
has O
already O
received O
media N
coverage N
from O
publications N
including O
; O
The O
Brooklyn O
Paper N
, O
The O
New H
York H
Times O
, O
Jezebel O
, O
Metro.us O
, O
EDGE O
on O
the O
Net O
, O
and O
Instinct O
Magazine O
. O

Did O
you H
think O
when O
you H
created O
it O
that O
the O
Santorum O
cocktail N
would O
receive O
this O
news N
coverage N
? O

Not O
at O
all O
. O

We H
were O
just O
trying O
to O
come O
up O
with O
a O
topical O
and O
funny O
new O
cocktail N
for O
our H
customers H
to O
laugh O
about O
and O
enjoy O
. O

What O
culinary O
dishes N
would O
you H
recommend O
that O
go O
well O
with O
the O
Santorum O
cocktail N
? O

You'd O
You H
'd O
probably O
be O
having O
the O
cocktail N
at O
dessert N
time N
, O
so O
something O
sweet O
; O
ice N
cream N
or O
pie N
. O

Is O
the O
drink N
popular O
? O

How O
many O
times N
do O
you H
suppose O
you’ve O
you H
’ve O
served O
it O
at O
your H
establishment N
since O
its O
creation N
? O

The O
drink N
was O
mildly O
popular O
for O
the O
last O
few O
months N
, O
but O
of O
course N
has O
become O
a O
great O
deal O
more O
popular O
since O
getting O
all O
this O
publicity N
. O

We H
have O
no O
way N
to O
estimate N
how O
many O
times N
we've O
we H
've O
served O
it O
overall O
, O
but O
we're O
we H
're O
now O
pouring O
around O
ten O
a O
night N

unusual O
new O
sea N
anemone A

Tuesday O
, O
January O
21 O
, O
2014 O

How O
did O
you H
come O
to O
be O
involved O
with O
this O
discovery N

Frank H
Rack O
got O
in O
touch O
after O
they O
returned O
from O
Antarctica O
in O
hopes N
that O
I H
could O
help O
with O
an O
identification N
on O
the O
anemone A
. O

What O
was O
your H
first O
reaction N
upon O
learning O
there O
was O
an O
undiscovered O
ecosystem N
under O
the O
ice N
in O
the O
Ross O
Sea N
? O

I H
was O
amazed O
and O
really O
excited O
. O

I H
think O
to O
say O
it O
was O
unexpected O
is O
inaccurate O
, O
because O
it O
implies O
that O
there O
was O
a O
well O
- O
founded O
expectation N
of O
something O
. O

The O
technology N
that O
Frank H
and O
his O
colleagues H
are O
using O
to O
explore O
the O
ice N
is O
so O
important O
because O
, O
given O
our H
lack N
of O
data N
, O
we H
have O
no O
reasonable O
expectation N
of O
what O
it O
should O
be O
like O
, O
or O
what O
it O
shouldn't O
should O
n't O
be O
like O
. O

There's O
There O
's H
a O
return O
trip N
planned O
hopefully O
for O
2015 O
, O
with O
both O
biologists H
and O
ANDRILL O
geologists H
. O

Are O
you H
intending O
to O
go O
there O
yourself H
? O

I H
would O
love O
to O
. O

But O
I H
am O
also O
happy O
to O
not O
go O
, O
as O
long O
as O
someone H
collects O
more O
animals A
on O
my H
behalf N
! O

What O
I H
want O
to O
do O
with O
the O
animals A
requires O
new O
material O
preserved O
in O
diverse O
ways N
, O
but O
it O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
require O
me H
to O
be O
there O
. O

Although O
I H
am O
sure O
that O
being O
there O
would O
enhance O
my H
understanding N
of O
the O
animals A
and O
the O
system N
in O
which O
they O
live O
, O
and O
would O
help O
me H
formulate O
more O
and O
better O
questions N
about O
the O
anemones A
, O
ship N
time N
is O
expensive O
, O
especially O
in O
Antarctica O
, O
and O
if O
there O
are O
biologists H
whose O
contribution N
is O
predicated O
on O
being O
there O
, O
they O
should O
have O
priority N
to O
be O
there O
. O

These O
animals A
are O
shrouded O
in O
mystery N
. O

Some O
of O
the O
most O
intriguing O
questions N
are O
chemical N
; O
do O
they O
produce O
some O
kind N
of O
antifreeze N
, O
and O
is O
that O
orange N
glow N
in O
the O
ROV O
lights N
their O
own O
? O

Talk O
us H
through O
the O
difficulties N
encountered O
when O
trying O
to O
find O
answers N
with O
the O
specimens N
on O
hand N
. O

The O
samples N
we H
have O
are O
small O
in O
terms N
of O
numbers N
and O
they O
are O
all O
preserved O
in O
formalin N
( O
a O
kind N
of O
formaldehyde N
solution N
) O
. O

The O
formalin N
is O
great O
for O
preserving O
structures N
, O
but O
for O
anemones A
, O
it O
prevents O
study O
of O
DNA N
or O
of O
the O
chemistry N
of O
the O
body N
. O

This O
means N
we H
can't O
ca O
n't O
look O
at O
the O
issue N
you H
raise O
with O
these O
animals A
. O

What O
we H
could O
do O
, O
however O
, O
was O
to O
study O
anatomy N
and O
figure O
out H
what O
it O
is O
, O
so O
that O
when O
we H
have O
samples N
preserved O
for O
studying O
e.g. O
, O
the O
genome N
, O
transcriptome O
, O
or O
metabolome O
, O
or O
conduct O
tests N
of O
the O
fluid O
in O
the O
burrows N
or O
in O
the O
animals A
themselves O
, O
we H
can O
make O
precise O
comparisons N
, O
and O
figure O
out H
what O
these O
animals A
have O
or O
do O
( O
metabolically O
or O
chemically O
) O
that O
lets O
them O
live O
where O
they O
live O
. O

Just O
knowing O
a O
whole O
lot N
about O
a O
single O
species A
isn't O
is O
n't O
very O
useful O
, O
even O
if O
that O
animal A
is O
as O
special O
as O
these O
clearly O
are O
- O
we H
need O
to O
know O
what O
about O
them O
is O
different O
and O
thus O
related O
to O
living O
in O
this O
strange O
way N
. O

The O
only O
way N
to O
get O
at O
what's O
what O
's H
different O
is O
to O
make O
comparisons N
with O
close O
relatives A
. O

We H
can O
start O
that O
side N
of O
the O
work N
now O
, O
anticipating O
having O
more O
beasts A
in O
the O
future N
. O

In O
terms N
of O
their O
glow N
, O
I H
suspect O
that O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
theirs O
- O
although O
luminescence N
is O
common O
in O
anemone A
relatives A
, O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
usually O
make O
light N
themselves O
. O

They O
do O
make O
a O
host H
of O
florescent O
proteins N
, O
and O
these O
may O
interact O
with O
the O
light N
of O
the O
ROV O
to O
give O
that O
gorgeous O
glow N
. O

What O
analysis N
did O
you H
perform O
on O
the O
specimens N
and O
what O
equipment N
was O
used O
? O

I H
used O
a O
dissecting O
scope N
to O
look O
at O
the O
animal's O
animal A
's H
external O
anatomy N
and O
overall O
body N
organization N
( O
magnification N
of O
60 O
X O
) O
. O

I H
embedded O
a O
few O
of O
the O
animals A
in O
wax N
and O
then O
cut O
them O
into O
very O
thin O
slices N
using O
a O
microtome N
, O
mounted O
the O
slices N
on O
microscope N
slides N
, O
stained O
the O
slices N
to O
enhance O
contrast N
, O
and O
then O
looked O
at O
those O
slides N
under O
a O
compound N
microscope N

( O
that's O
that O
's H
how O
I H
got O
the O
pictures N
of O
the O
muscles N
etc O
in O
the O
paper N
) O
. O

I H
used O
that O
same O
compound N
scope N
to O
look O
at O
squashed O
bits N
of O
tissue N
to O
see O
the O
stinging O
capsules N
( O
= O
nematocysts O
) O
. O

I H
compared O
the O
things N
I H
saw O
under O
the O
'scopes O
to O
what O
had O
been O
published O
on O
other O
species A
in O
this O
group N
. O

This O
step O
seems O
trivial O
, O
but O
it O
is O
really O
the O
most O
important O
part N
! O

By O
comparing O
my H
observations N
to O
what O
my H
colleagues H
and O
predecessors H
had O
found O
, O
I H
figured O
out H
what O
group N
it O
belongs O
to O
, O
and O
was O
able O
to O
determine O
that O
within O
that O
group N
, O
it O
was O
a O
new O
species A
. O

It O
was O
three O
years N
between O
recovery N
of O
specimens N
and O
final O
publication N
, O
why O
did O
it O
take O
so O
long O
? O

You H
mean O
, O
how O
did O
we H
manage O
to O
make O
it O
all O
happen O
so O
quickly O
, O
right O
? O
:) O

It O
was O
about O
two O
years N
from O
when O
Frank H
sent O
me H
specimens N
to O
when O
we H
got O
the O
paper N
out H
. O

Some O
of O
that O
time N
was O
just O
lost O
time N
- O
I H
had O
other O
projects N
in O
the O
queue N
that O
I H
needed O
to O
finish O
. O

Once O
we H
figured O
out H
what O
it O
was O
, O
we H
played O
a O
lot N
of O
manuscript N
email N
tag O
, O
which O
can O
be O
challenging O
and O
time N
consuming O
given O
the O
differing O
schedules N
that O
folks N
keep O
in O
terms N
of O
travel O
, O
field N
work N
, O
etc. O

Manuscript N
review N
and O
processing O
took O
about O
four O
months N
. O

What O
sort N
of O
difficulties N
were O
posed O
by O
the O
unorthodox O
preservatives N
used O
, O
and O
what O
additional O
work N
might O
be O
possible O
on O
a O
specimen N
with O
intact O
DNA N
? O

The O
preservation N
was O
not O
unorthodox O
- O
they O
followed O
best O
practices N
for O
anatomical O
preservation N
. O

Having O
DNA N
- O
suitable O
material O
will O
let O
us H
see O
whether O
there O
are O
new O
genes N
, O
or O
genes N
turned O
on O
in O
different O
ways N
and O
at O
different O
times N
that O
help O
explain O
how O
these O
animals A
burrow O
into O
hard O
ice N
and O
then O
survive O
in O
the O
cold O
. O

I H
am O
curious O
about O
the O
population N
structure N
of O
the O
" O
fields N
" O
of O
anemones A
- O
the O
group N
to O
which O
Edwardsiella O
andrillae O
belongs O
includes O
many O
species A
that O
reproduce O
asexually O
, O
and O
it's O
it O
's H
possible O
that O
the O
fields N
are O
" O
clones H
" O
produced O
asexually O
rather O
than O
the O
result N
of O
sexual O
reproduction N
. O

DNA N
is O
the O
only O
way N
to O
test N
this O
. O

would O
hire O
, O
what O
the O
average O
person H
would O
think O
we H
would O
hire O
. O

We H
hire O
educated O
, O
nice O
people N
. O

I H
remember O
one N
of O
our H
ads N
that O
I H
had O
put O
in O
said O
, O
" O
If O
you H
think O
nice O
girls H
don't O
do O
n't O
do O
S&M O
, O
" O
-- O
I H
forgot O
what O
the O
rest N
of O
it O
said O
-- O

" O
-- O
think O
again O
. O
" O

Yeah O
, O
" O
think O
again O
" O
or O
something O
like O
that O
. O

And O
that O
ad O
had O
pulled O
so O
many O
girls H
, O
because O
they O
-- O
I H
think O
they O
all O
thought O
that O
nice O
girls H
don't O
do O
n't O
do O
this O
. O

And O
a O
bunch N
of O
them O
had O
called O
and O
they O
said O
, O
" O
Wow O
. O
" O

And O
I H
think O
I H
remember O
, O
a O
bunch N
of O
guys H
called O
because O
of O
that O
also O
. O

Do O
you H
remember O
? O

I H
sure O
do O
, O
I H
sure O
do O
. O

What O
are O
the O
startup N
costs O
involved O
? O

It O
varies O
; O
look O
around O
Manhattan O
, O
look O
around O
rents N
, O
look O
around O
build-outs O
, O
look O
around O
hiring O
, O
look O
around O
advertising N
... O

What's O
What O
's H
your H
greatest O
non-fixed O
cost O
? O

The O
single O
most O
costly O
thing N
we H
spend O
on O
is O
rent O
and O
advertising N
, O
those O
two O
together O
make O
up O
the O
bulk N
of O
what O
we H
spend O
. O

There's O
There O
's H
supplies N
, O
and O
there's O
there O
's H
wear O
and O
tear N
and O
maintenance N
, O
and O
bookkeeping N
and O
things N
like O
that O
that O
you H
have O
to O
do O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
about O
it O
. O

The O
hardest O
thing N
in O
running O
this O
business N
, O
which O
is O
why O
people N
can't O
ca O
n't O
do O
it O
, O
is O
the O
relationship N
that O
my H
wife H
has O
with O
the O
gals H
and O
with O
the O
customers H
. O

Where O
do O
you H
advertise O
? O

A H
lot N
on O
the O
web N
, O
we've O
we H
've O
used O
most O
of O
the O
local O
city N
papers N
, O
New H
York H
Press O
, O
things N
like O
that O
, O
L H
Magazine O
. O

In O
the O
back O
of O
the O
paper N
? O

Typically O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
paper N
. O

Magazines N
constantly O
change O
their O
policy N
on O
it O
; O
they O
want O
it O
, O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
it O
... O

Depending O
on O
the O
election N
year N
-- O

Who's O
Who O
's H
buying O
the O
paper N
, O
who's O
who O
's H
selling O
the O
paper N
. O

So O
it O
changes N
, O
so O
one N
year N
we H
got O
to O
be O
in O
the O
Press O
, O
but O
they O
have O
now O
stopped O
adult O
ads N
. O

Completely O
. O

So O
now O
we'll O
we H
'll O
be O
in O
the O
Voice O
for O
a O
while O
. O

We're O
We H
're O
moving O
more O
towards O
the O
Internet N
at O
this O
point N
, O
because O
the O
Internet N
is O
a O
much O
easier O
, O
safer O
way N
for O
a O
person H
to O
look O
at O
sensitive O
material O
and O
not O
get O
caught O
with O
it O
. O

Pursuant O
to O
your H

: O
we H
only O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
care N
if O
a O
girl H
is O
absolutely O
exquisite O
looking O

My H

has O
met O
beautiful O

beautiful O

-- O

-- O
beautiful O
girls H
-- O

-- O
and O
he's O
he O
's H
in O
the O
end N
, O
he O
would O
say O
, O
" O
Well O
, O
I H
won't O
wo O
n't O

them O
. O
" O

I'm O
I H
'm O
like O
, O
‘ O
Are O
you H
insane O
? O

I H
won't O
wo O
n't O
hire O
them O
. O

I H
hire O
-- O

Why O
not O
? O

Because O
I H
want O
someone H
who's O
who O
's H
going O
to O
treat O
people N
nicely O
and O
well O
. O

We H
have O
-- O

How O
can O
you H
tell O
whether O
they O
will O
or O
will O
not O
? O

Just O
by O
talking O
to O
them O
? O

Having O
been O
a O
psychologist H
for O
a O
number N
of O
years N
gives O
me H
a O
leg N
up O
on O
it O
. O

And O
he's O
he O
's H
been O
right O
. O

And O
I H
have O
made O
him O
hire O
these O
girls H
, O
and O
ultimately O
he's O
he O
's H
been O
right O

They've O
They O
've O
been O
complete O
pain N
in O
the O
asses N
! O

I H
also O
have O
a O
profile N
they O
fill O
out H
for O
me H
, O
a O
mini-MMPI O
that O
I H
developed O
, O
so O
that O
I H
have O
an O
idea N
-- O
Rebecca H
and O
I H
put O
it O
together O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
you'd O
you H
'd O
like O
to O
see O
one N
. O

No O
, O
no O
, O
no O
. O
Just O
-- O

I H
could O
show O
you H
. O

So O
I H
have O
a O
mini-MMPI O
that O
I H
-- O

Could O
I H
have O
a O
sample N
, O
not O
necessarily O
one N
that's O
that O
's H
filled O
out H
, O
but O
just O
one N
that O
you H
-- O

I'll O
I H
'll O
show O
you H
. O

The O
questions N
are O
-- O

Be O
careful O
. O

He'll O
He O
'll O
make O
you H
fill O
one N
out H
. O

You'd O
You H
'd O
be O
scared O
. O

You H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
hire O
me H
. O

Is O
it O
only O
girls H
you H
hire O
? O

Yeah O
. O

What O
would O
a O
question N
like O
" O
the O
greatest O
woman H
in O
the O
world N
" O
reveal O
to O
you H
? O

No O
question N
would O
reveal O
anything O
independently O
of O
all O
the O
questions N
together O
-- O

Sure O
. O

-- O
but O
I H
have O
a O
chart N
that O
I'll O
I H
'll O
go O
through O
; O
the O
MMPI O
. O

The O
baseline N
data N
that O
I H
use H
to O
-- O

How O
did O
you H
originate O
these O
questions N
? O

Where O
did O
I H
make O
them O
? O

You H
get O
a O
baseline N
from O
asking O
girls H
and O
refining O
profiles N
-- O

And O
it's O
it O
's H
an O
amalgamation N
of O
questions N
. O

Of O
many O
, O
many O
questions N
-- O

What's O
What O
's H
your H
favorite O
question N
? O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
the O
O.J. O
Simpson H
…. O

Yeah O
, O
I H
see O
O.J. O
Simpson H
. O

What O
would O
that O
be O
an O
indicator N
of O
? O

I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
sure O
which O
one N
you H
gave O
him O
, O
but O
there's O
there O
's H
a O
brief N
, O
brief N
, O
brief N
IQ N
test N
there O
. O

Very O
brief N
. O

Do O
you H
ask O
for O
references N
? O

No O
, O
because O
I H
really O
can't O
ca O
n't O
call O
and O
tell O

I'm O
I H
'm O
yeah O

Interview O

For O
our H
readers H
who O
are O
unaware O
of O
your H
site N
, O
could O
you H
briefly O
explain O
what O
wikiHow O
is O
? O

Sure O
. O

wikiHow O
is O
a O
collaborative O
effort N
to O
build O
the O
world's O
world N
's H
largest O
, O
highest O
quality N
how O
- O
to O

Our H
long O
term N
goal N
is O
to O
produce O
practical O
instructions N
on O
almost O
every O
topic N
in O
every O
language N
. O

We're O
We H
're O
quite O
far O
from O
our H
goals N
currently O
, O
but O
we H
take O
comfort O
in O
the O
fact N
that O
every O
month N
wikiHow O
gets O
noticeably O
better O
and O
larger O

We H
currently O
have O
just O
under O
50000 O
articles N
and O
over O
1000 O
featured O
articles N
. O

We H
hope O
that O
in O
time N
, O
we H
will O
have O
millions N
of O
articles N
with O
many O
of O
them O
having O
featured O
status N
. O

That O
said O
, O
we H
are O
realistic O
enough O
to O
realize O
that O
this O
goal N
will O
take O
decades N
to O
achieve O
. O

However O
, O
in O
terms N
of O
readership N
, O
we H
are O
probably O
the O
most O
popular O
single O
subject O
wiki O
after O
Wikipedia O
. O

We H
get O
over O
14 O
million O
unique O
visitors H
per O
month N
( O

) O
, O
which O
makes O
us H
the O
135th O
most O
popular O

to O

That O
said O
, O
we H
are O
quite O
different O
from O

several O
respects N
: O

We H
are O
much O
smaller O

has O
only O
60 O

compared O
to O
the O
1000 O

As O
a O
result N
, O
wikiHow O
is O
still O
at O
the O

that O

eventually O

As O
a O

some O

believe O
wikiHow O
is O
a O
more O
humane O
and O
enjoyable O
place N
to O
work N
than O
other O
places N
online O
. O

Why O
did O
you H
decide O
to O
create O
wikiHow O
? O

I H
think O
that O
providing O
people N
with O
a O
practical O
education N
is O
one N
of O
the O
most O
empowering O
things N
you H
can O
offer O
a O
person H
. O

Imagine O
having O
detailed O
step O
- O
by O
- O
step O
instructions N
on O
how O
to O
do O
any O
activity N
you H
could O
imagine O
. O

How O
much O
more O
could O
you H
accomplish O
as O
an O
individual O
if O
you H
could O
learn O
any O
activity N
? O

I H
think O
that O
building N
a O
universal O
how O
- O
to O
manual N
would O
be O
a O
tremendous O
gift N
for O
the O
world N
. O

Knowledge N
is O
power N
and O
wikiHow O
has O
the O
potential N
to O
make O
all O
of O
us H
a O
bit N
more O
powerful O
. O

I've O
I H
've O
been O
interested O
in O
building N
a O
comprehensive O
how O
- O
to O
manual N
long O
before O
I H
first O
envisioned O
wikiHow O
. O

My H
first O
attempt N
at O
building N
this O
resource N
was O
a O
website N
I H
used O
to O
run O
called O
eHow O
. O

eHow O
was O
and O
continues O
to O
be O
the O
largest O
and O
how O
to O
website N
in O
the O
world N
. O

eHow O
contains O
copyrighted O
content N
run O
on O
proprietary O
software N
. O

When O
I H
ran O
eHow O
, O
the O
content N
was O
professionally O
produced O
and O
edited O
. O

This O
business N
model N
worked O
for O
producing O
content N
on O
topics N
that O
appeal O
to O
advertisers H
in O
languages N
like O
English O
that O
have O
large O
advertising N
markets N
. O

However O
, O
paying O
people N
to O
write O
and O
edit O
articles N
ultimately O
means N
that O
you H
have O
to O
make O
one N
of O
two O
sacrifices N
. O

You H
either O
1) O
sacrifice N
on O
breadth N
and O
don't O
do O
n't O
produce O
the O
topics N
that O
won't O
wo O
n't O
interest N
advertisers H
, O
or O
2) O
you H
sacrifice N
on O
quality N
and O
produce O
content N
that O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
cost O
much O
to O
write O
. O

I H
wasn't O
was O
n't O
interested O
in O
making O
either O
of O
these O
sacrifices N
, O
as O
I H
think O
the O
world's O
world N
's H
how O
to O
manual N
needs N
to O
be O
high O
quality N
AND O
comprehensive O
. O

So O
ultimately O
I H
decided O
that O
eHow's O
eHow O
's H
model N
would O
not O
build O
the O
resource N
I H
envisioned O
. O

When O
I H
discovered O
Wikipedia O
, O
I H
recognized O
that O
the O
wiki O
model N
had O
the O
potential N
to O
build O
the O
how O
- O
to O
resource N
the O
world N
really O
needs N
. O

So O
I H
decided O
to O
sell O
eHow O
and O
use H
the O
proceeds O
to O
build O
wikiHow O
. O

Why O
did O
you H

the O

( O
http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Right-to-Fork O
) O
. O

In O
my H
opinion N
, O
people N
should O
be O
hesitant O
to O
contribute O
to O
websites N
where O
you H
only O
have O
the O
" O
right O

If O

think O
our H

going O
in O
the O
wrong O
direction N
, O
they O
can O
take O
all O
the O
content N
and O
all O
the O

move O
the O

elsewhere O

I H
believe O
that O
offering O
this O
right O

has O
been O
a O

My H
hope O

that O

That O

didn't O

wikiHow O
achieved O
this O
popularity N
for O
a O
few O
reasons N

First O
, O
people N

the O

desperate O
for O
high O
quality N

most O

the O

Second O
, O
we H

the O

We H

about O
attitudes N

the O

. O

Ličen O
has O
recently O
joined O
the O
Sport O
Management O
Program N
at O
Washington H
State N
University N
to O
develop O
its O
sport N
media N
and O
communication N
research N
and O
teaching O
contents N
. O

Originally O
from O
Slovenia O
, O
he O
served O
as O
the O
Director O
of O
Media O
and O
Communications O
of O
a O
WTA O
Tour O
event N
and O
was O
a O
member N
of O
the O
UNESCO O
Slovenian O
National O
Commission N
. O

He O
was O
also O
the O
Team O
Manager H
of O
the O
Slovenian O
wheelchair N
basketball N
national O
team N
. O

Why O
do O
you H
think O
the O
Paralympic O
movement N
has O
so O
little O
visibility N
in O
the O
US O
compared O
to O
other O
countries N
like O
Australia O
, O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
and O
even O
Canada O
? O

Sports N
in O
the O
United O
States O
largely O
reaffirm O
existing O
relations N
of O
power N
in O
society N
. O

It O
emphasizes O
consumerism N
, O
the O
belief N
that O
success N
always O
goes O
to O
people N
who O
merit N
it O
due O
to O
their O
abilities N
, O
dedication N
and O
qualifications N
, O
and O
reinforces O
, O
rather O
than O
changes N
, O
existing O
ideas N
related O
to O
gender N
, O
ethnicity N
and O
nationality N
. O

Paralympic O
sport N
brings O
attention N
to O
athletes H
who O
are O
typically O
overlooked O
in O
American O
society N
because O
the O
majority N
of O
the O
population N
does O
not O
want O
to O
identify O
with O
people N
who O
are O
disabled O
. O

Although O
disability N
is O
not O
contagious O
, O
interest N
in O
disabled O
sports N
might O
put O
into O
question N
the O
masculinity N
of O
the O
males A
following O
it O
. O

Disabled O
athletes H
also O
challenge N
existing O
relations N
of O
power N
by O
displaying O
dedication N
, O
hard O
work N
and O
perseverance N
in O
different O
contexts N
than O
those O
most O
sports N
fans H
are O
accustomed O
to O
. O

Other O
countries N
, O
including O
the O
ones N
you H
mention N
, O
have O
stronger O
social O
orientations N
in O
all O
aspects N
of O
society N
. O

Even O
though O
legislative O
support N
may O
be O
less O
strong O
than O
the O
one N
provided O
by O
the O
Americans O
with O
Disabilities O
Act O
, O
many O
social O
institutions N
including O
the O
media N
are O
more O
receptive O
to O
this O
form N
of O
diversity N
. O

What O
do O
you H
think O
the O
impact N
will O
be O
for O
the O
Paralympic O
movement N
will O
be O
with O
the O
Games O
being O
televised O
live O
in O
the O
United O
States O
for O
first O
time N
? O

The O
impact N
depends O
on O
a O
number N
of O
aspects N
. O

One O
of O
them O
is O
the O
channels N
that O
NBC O
as O
the O
broadcasting O
rights N
owner H
for O
the O
United O
States O
will O
use H
to O
air N
the O
Paralympic O
Games O
on O
. O

Will H
they O
be O
shown O
nationally O
or O
regionally O
, O
on O
NBC O
or O
on O
any O
of O
the O
company’s O
company N
’s H
multiple O
cable N
networks N
? O

A H
second N
aspect N
is O
the O
parts N
or O
hours N
of O
the O
day N
the O
Paralympics O
will O
be O
shown O
. O

Remember O
that O
there O
is O
a O
nine O
- O
hour N
difference N
between O
Sochi O
and O
New H
York H
, O
and O
a O
12 O
- O
hour N
difference N
between O
Sochi O
and O
the O
US O
West O
Coast O
. O

So O
daytime N
events N
will O
be O
shown O
live O
in O
the O
United O
States O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night N
, O
and O
evening N
prime O
- O
time N
events N
will O
be O
shown O
— O
indeed O
live O
— O
in O
the O
morning N
U.S. O
time N
. O

So O
showing O
the O
Paralympics O
live O
on O
United O
States O
television N
might O
turn O
out H
to O
be O
less O
glamorous O
than O
it O
appears O
. O

A H
third O
important O
factor N
is O
the O
way N
the O
event N
will O
be O
mediated O
: O
will O
NBC O
have O
its O
best O
sports N
broadcasters H
following O
the O
event N
after O
having O
worked O
the O
Winter H
Olympics O
? O

Will H
they O
treat O
and O
announce O
the O
competitions N
as O
they O
do O
all O
others O
— O
for O
better O
and O
worse O
? O

Will H
they O
take O
it O
as O
an O
opportunity N
to O
educate O
viewers H
about O
disability N
and O
diversity N
while O
showing O
superb O
athletic O
performances N
without O
engaging O
in O
a O
discourse N
of O
pity N
? O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I H
think O
this O
is O
a O
terrific O
opportunity N
to O
improve O
sports N
coverage N
in O
a O
multitude N
of O
aspects N
; O
but O
we H
will O
have O
to O
wait N
until O
after O
the O
event N
to O
assess O
to O
what O
extent N
the O
broadcasters H
will O
meet O
these O
expectations N
. O

Sunday O

2006 O

The O
LibriVox O
website N
features O
a O
catalog N
of O
about O
a O
hundred O
completed O
books N
, O
including O
books N
in O
other O
languages N
like O
German O
, O
Hebrew O
, O
and O
Japanese O
. O

Why O
did O
you H
decide O
to O
take O
the O
acoustic O
fate N
of O
public O
domain N
works O
into O
your H
own O
hands N
, O
and O
how O
did O
you H
go O
about O
it O
? O

I H
think O
that O
a O
vibrant O
public O
domain N
is O
very O
important O
to O
a O
healthy O
world N
, O
and O
so O
I H
thought O
: O
here's O
here O
's H
a O
way N
to O
help O
the O
cause N
. O

I H
launched O
LibriVox O
, O
emailed O
some O
friends H
and O
some O
podcasters O
who O
where O
doing O
literary O
stuff N
, O
and O
invited O
them O
to O
record N
a O
chapter N
of O
Joseph H
Conrad's O
Conrad H
's H
Secret N
Agent O
. O

Things N
have O
grown O
steadily O
since O
. O

By O
the O
way N
, O
AKMA O
was O
the O
first O
guy H
I H
know O
of O
to O
do O
something O
like O
this O
, O
with O
Lawrence H
Lessig's O
Lessig O
's H
Free O
Culture N
. O

That O
, O
I H
think O
, O
started O
my H
thinking O
about O
this O
, O
but O
it O
took O
a O
while O
for O
the O
idea N
to O
crystallize O
. O

Hugh H
McGuire H
with O
some O
books N
that O
have O
not O
yet O
been O
acoustically O
liberated O
. O

Do O
you H
personally O
record N
audiobooks O
, O
and O
did O
you H
already O
do O
so O
before O
LibriVox O
? O

LibriVox O
was O
my H
first O
experience N
recording O
audiobooks O
. O

I H
still O
do O
the O
odd O
chapter N
, O
but O
i H
am O
a O
bit N
delinquent O
in O
finishing N
some O
of O
them O
these O
days N
! O

Is O
there O
a O
particular O
LibriVox O
book O
which O
you H
think O
stands O
out H
because O
of O
the O
quality N
, O
the O
overall O
effort N
involved O
, O
its O
popularity N
, O
or O
for O
some O
other O
reason N
? O

My H
personal O
favourite O
is O
Notes O
from O
the O
Underground O
( O
Dostoyevsky O
) O
. O

Other O
random O
good O
ones N
: O

Austen H

: O
See O
the O
LibriVox O
catalog N
for O
a O
full O
index N
. O

Browsing O
the O
catalog N
, O
I H
find O
that O
the O
quality N
of O
the O
spoken O
audio N
varies O
greatly O
from O
text N
to O
text N
or O
even O
varies O
from O
chapter N
to O
chapter N
. O

If O
someone H
wanted O
to O
re-record O
a O
chapter N
because O
they O
didn't O
did O
n't O
like O
the O
speaker N
, O
would O
you H
then O
offer O
two O
versions N
? O

Yes O
. O

We H
take O
the O
Wikipedia O
approach N
: O
if O
you H
think O
it O
should O
be O
better O
, O
please O
help O
it O
be O
so O
. O

You'll O
You H
'll O
note N
we H
offer O
a O
couple N
of O
versions N
of O
some O
books N
. O

Indeed O
our H
weekly O
poetry N
project N
celebrates O
this O
diversity N
of O
voice H
: O
each O
week N
a O
new O
short O
poem N
is O
chosen O
and O
as O
many O
readers H
as O
wish O
to O
record N
a O
version N
, O
so O
you H
get O
20 O
+ O
versions N
of O
the O
same O
poem N
, O
a O
very O
interesting O
audio N
experience N
. O

Besides O
works O
whose O
copyright N
has O
expired O
, O
there O
is O
an O
increasing O
number N
of O
modern O
books N
available O
under O
Creative O
Commons O
and O
similar O
licenses N
. O

You H
mentioned O
Larry H
Lessig's O
Lessig O
's H
Free O
Culture N
, O
but O
it O
also O
includes O
some O
out H
of O
print N
titles N
by O
publishers N
who O
are O
open O
to O
the O
concept N
, O
such O
as O
O'Reilly O
. O

Do O
you H
want O
to O
limit O
the O
scope N
of O
LibriVox O
strictly O
to O
old O
public O
domain N
works O
, O
or O
do O
you H
have O
plans N
to O
include O
recent O
works O
under O
reasonably O
permissive O
licenses N
as O
well O
? O

We H
are O
only O
doing O
public O
domain N
works O
, O
for O
a O
number N
of O
reasons N
, O
partly O
to O
keep O
simplicity N
in O
our H
copyright N
situation N
-- O
public O
domain N
means N
its O
it O
s H
as O
simple O
as O
can O
be O
. O

CC O
makes O
things N
more O
complex O
. O

Also O
, O
there O
are O
other O
sites N
, O
notably O
podiobooks.com O
, O
which O
are O
better O
suited O
to O
CC O
works O
than O
LibriVox O
. O

we H
find O
it O
makes O
things N
clear N
and O
easy O
to O
say O
: O
published O
works O
, O
public O
domain N
, O
and O
leave O
it O
at O
that O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I H
can O
tell O
, O
podiobooks.com O
features O
" O
free O
as O
in O
beer N
" O
content N
— O
material O
which O
you H
can O
download O

but O
which O
isn't O
is O
n't O
under O
a O
free O

license N
. O

Instead O
of O
" O
public O

" O
, O
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
" O
free O
content N
" O
work N
just O
as O
well O
, O
using O
something O
like O
the O
Free O
Content O
Definition O
to O
limit O
the O
scope N
? O

This O
needs N
more O
discussion N
obviously O
: O
we H
chose O
public O
domain N
because O
the O
texts N
we H
use H
are O
public O
domain N
and O
we H
didn't O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
add O
new O
restrictions N
, O
especially O
not O
non-commercial O
, O
since O
already O
our H
recordings N
are O
being O
used O
for O
a O
number N
of O
commercialish O
projects N
( O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
recall O
any O
specific O
project N
names N
, O
but O
some O
pay O
- O
education N
sites N
use H
LV O
stuff N
) O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
good O
and O
well O
and O
fine O
with O
us H
. O

We H
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
have O
to O
give O
anyone O
permission N
to O
use H
our H
recordings N
, O
we H
want O
anyone O
to O
use H
them O
for O
whatever O
they O
want O
. O

Also O
, O
for O
the O
thing N
to O
work N
you H
need O
to O
have O
many O
dedicated O
volunteers H
willing O
to O
do O
the O
management N
( O
onerous O
) O
and O
many O
willing O
to O
do O
the O
reading O
. O

While O
Pride O
and O

will O
attract O
many O
readers H
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
about O

the O
Gliders O
team N
. O

So O
we H
were O
trying O
to O
get O
as O
many O
international O
games N
as O
possible O
. O

Cause O
that's O
that O
's H
one N
of O
our H
problems N
really O
, O
to O
compete O
. O

It O
costs O
us H
so O
much O
money N
to O
for O
us H
to O
travel O
overseas O
and O
to O
compete O
internationally O
. O

And O
so O
we H
can O
compete O
against O
each O
other O
all O
the O
time N
within O
Australia O
but O
we H
really O
need O
to O
be O
able O
to O
... O

It's O
It O
's H
not O
the O
same O
. O

No O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
really O
not O
, O
so O
it's O
it O
's H
really O
important O
to O
be O
able O
to O
get O
as O
a O
many O
international O
trips N
throughout O
the O
year N
to O
continue O
our H
improvement N
. O

Also O
see O
where O
all O
the O
other O
teams N
are O
at O
as O
well O
. O

But O
yes O
, O
Spitfire O
was O
good O
. O

We H
took O
quite O
a O
few O
new O
girls H
over O
there O
back O
then O
in O
2005 O
, O
leading N
into O
the O
World N
Cup O
in O
the O
Netherlands O
. O

Was O
that O
the O
one N
where O
you H
were O
the O
captain H
of O
the O
team N
, O
in O
2005 O
? O

Or O
was O
that O
a O
later O
one N
? O

No O
, O
I H
captained O
in O
2010 O
. O

So O
2009 O
, O
2010 O
World N
Cup O
. O

And O
then O
I H
had O
a O
bit N
of O
some O
time N
off O
in O
2011 O
. O

The O
Gliders O
have O
never O
won O
the O
World N
Championship O
. O

We H
always O
seem O
to O
have O
just O
a O
little O
bit N
of O
a O
chill O
out H
at O
the O
World N
Cup O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
really O
strange O
occurrence N
, O
over O
the O
years N
. O

2002 O
World N
Cup O
, O
we H
won O
bronze N
. O

Then O
in O
2006 O
we H
ended O
up O
fourth O
. O

It O
was O
one N
of O
the O
worst O
World N
Cups O
we've O
we H
've O
played O
actually O
. O

And O
then O
in O
2010 O
we H
just O
... O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
happened O
. O

We H
just O
didn't O
did O
n't O
play O
as O
well O
as O
we H
thought O
we H
would O
. O

Came O
fourth O
. O

But O
you H
know O
what O
? O

Fired O
us H
up O
for O
the O
actual O
Paralympics O
. O

So O
the O
World N
Cup O
is O
... O
it's O
it O
's H
good O
to O
be O
able O
to O
do O
well O
at O
the O
World N
Cup O
, O
to O
be O
placed O
, O
but O
it O
also O
means N
that O
you H
get O
a O
really O
good O
opportunity N
to O
know O
where O
you're H
you H
're O
at O
in O
that O
two O
year N
gap N
between O
the O
Paralympics O
. O

So O
you H
can O
come O
back O
home N
and O
revisit O
what O
you H
need O
to O
do O
and O
, O
you H
know O
, O
where O
the O
team's O
team N
's H
at O
. O

And O
all O
that O
sort N
of O
stuff N
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
they O
are O
talking O
about O
moving O
it O
so O
it O
will O
be O
on O
the O
year N
before O
the O
Paralympics O
. O

Oh O
really O
. O

The O
competition N
from O
the O
[ O
FIFA O
] O
World N
Cup O
and O
all O
. O

Right O
. O

Well O
, O
that O
would O
be O
sad O
. O

An O
Interview O
with O
the O
' O
Mets O
Poet O
' O

Wednesday O
, O
October O

, O
2007 O

You H
have O
received O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
attention N
recently O
. O

Even O
though O
I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
Michael H
Jackson H
or O
somebody H
, O
when O
people N
come O
up O
to O
me H
and O
introduce O
themselves O
and O
say O
, O
' O
Hey O
Frank H
, O
my H
name N
is O
John H
, O
' O
I H
say O
, O
' O
Hey O
John H
, O
my H
name N
is O
Frank H
' O
and O
they O
laugh O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
a O
funny O
phenomenon N
. O

What O
goes O
through O
your H
head N
when O
that O
happens O
? O

I H
understand O
it O
. O

I've O
I H
've O
gone O
to O
readings N
and O
concerts N
. O

I H
look O
at O
it O
as O
human O
interaction N
. O

Over O
the O
years N
I H
have O
performed O
in O
32 O
countries N
and O
40 O
states N
. O

I've O
I H
've O
been O
doing O
this O
professionally O
since O
I H
was O
in O
my H
twenties N
, O
and O
before O
that O
since O
I H
was O
sixteen O
doing O
little O
tidbit N
poetry N
readings N
in O
coffeehouses N
. O

The O
band N
I H
started O
in O
1993 O
, O
Spoken O
Motion O
, O
received O
a O
lot N
of O
recognition N
as O
a O
spoken O
word N
band N
born O
out H
of O
the O
New H
York H
spoken O
word N
scene N
. O

I H
worked O
with O
some O
great O
musicians H
and O
performed O
around O
the O
world N
. O

I H
remember O
signing O
my H
first O
autograph N
to O
a O
kid H
when O
I H
was O
25 O
years N
old O
. O

As O
time N
went O
on O
, O
I H
came O
out H
with O
books N
and O
CDs N
, O
and O
I H
became O
used O
to O
that O
kind N
of O
thing N
. O

To O
me H
, O
the O
ultimate O
feeling O
of O
success N
as O
an O
artist H
, O
is O
to O
move O
somebody H
enough O
where O
they O
thank O
you H
. O

When O
someone H
comes O
up O
and O
says O
, O
' O
Frank H
, O
thank O
you H
, O
your H
work N
is O
great O
. O
" O

You H
have O
a O
long O
career N
in O
poetry N
, O
but O
as O
of O
late O
the O
attention N
you H
have O
garnered O
is O
for O
the O
Mets O
- O
inspired O
work N
. O

How O
do O
you H
feel O
about O
having O
a O
lot N
of O
your H
work N
overshadowed O
by O
the O
Mets O
work N
? O

It's O
It O
's H
ironic O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
greatest O
poetry N
has O
been O
born O
out H
of O
failure N
and O
the O
depths N
of O
adversity N
in O
the O
human O
experience N
. O

Walt H
Whitman H
, O
the O
first O
great O
American O
poet H
, O
wrote O
about O
the O
Civil O
War N
. O

He O
went O
looking O
for O
his O
brother H
, O
George H
Whitman H
, O
after O
he O
a O
telegram N
telling O
him O
his O
brother H
was O
injured O
in O
the O
South O
. O

When O
he O
started O
out H
his O
poems N
were O
about O
beating N
drums N
, O
and O
blow O
, O
bugle O
, O
blow O
. O

Real O
patriotic O
. O

Then O
he O
started O
to O
see O
the O
real O
horrors N
of O
war N
. O

He O
was O
able O
to O
tap O
into O
the O
human O
condition N
and O
the O
situation N
at O
that O
time N
. O

Eventually O
when O
he O
found O
his O
brother H
he O
had O
resolution N
. O

I H
experienced O
that O
kind N
of O
adversity N
during O
9/11 O
being O
a O
civilian O
volunteer H
. O

I H
loaded O
ferry N
boats N
in O
Jersey O
City N
across O
the O
river N
to O
deliver O
goods N
to O
Ground N
Zero O
. O

I H
turned O
to O
Whitman H
to O
find O
some O
understanding N
of O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
the O
world N
right O
now O
. O

When O
I H
wrote O
my H
9/11 O
- O
related O
poems N
, O
that O
was O
true O
adversity N
. O

I H
realize O
baseball N
is O
just O
a O
game N
. O

Can O
you H
recite O
a O
stanza N
that O
expresses O
how O
you H
feel O
right O
now O
? O

This O
was O
a O
piece N
that O
the O
Times O
only O
quoted O
one N
stanza N
, O
but O
it's O
it O
's H
about O
preparation N
for O
a O
battle N
, O
and O
being O
prepared O
to O
either O
rise N
to O
the O
occasion N
, O
or O
go O
down O
: O

Do O
you H
know O
what O
it's O
it O
's H
like O
to O
be O
chased O
by O
the O
Ghost O
of O
Failure N
while O
staring O
through O
Victory's O

door N

This O
one N

it O

I H
have O
never O

you H
during O

I H
just O
wanted O

I H

you H

' O

Last O
year N
in O
my H
section N
at O
the O
stadium N
I H
had O
a O
banner N
that O
read O
We H
Know O
' O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
all O
it O
said O
. O

Then O
earlier O
this O
year N
these O
shirts N
started O
to O
come O
out H
that O
said O
, O
" O
Poet O
says O
We H
Know O
" O
. O

It O
was O
amazing O
. O

We H
didn't O
did O
n't O
use H
the O
banner N
this O
year N
, O
though O
, O
because O
we H
didn't O
did O
n't O
know O
. O

The O
team N
wasn't O
was O
n't O
so O
far O
ahead O
that O
we H
knew O
. O

Last O
year N
we H
just O
knew O
we H
were O
going O
to O
the O
playoffs N
; O
we H
knew O
we H
were O
going O
post-season O
. O

This O
year N
we H
weren't O
were O
n't O
sure O
. O

We H
were O
walking O
on O
eggshells N
. O

There O
was O
a O
woman H
, O
a O
season N
ticket N
holder N
and O
a O
die O
hard O
fan N
. O

She O
was O
staggered O
by O
the O
loss N
last O
year N
to O
the O
Cardinals O

Last O
year N
she O
came O
up O
to O
me H
during O
one N
of O
the O
games N
late O
in O
the O
season N
; O
she O
was O
so O
happy O
we H
were O
going O
to O
the O
post N
season N
. O

By O
that O
point N
we H
had O
clinched O
it O
. O

She O
handed O
me H
a O
shirt N
she O
bought O
at O
the O
stadium N
and O
she O
gave O
me H
a O
big O
hug O
. O

With O
tears N
in O
her O
eyes N
she O
said O
, O
" O
Thank O

It's O
It O

it's O
it O

you H

aren't O

It's O
It O

For O
the O
last O

quite O

I H

by O
the O
way N

The O
back O
of O
my H
jersey N

The O

because O
growing O
up O

How O
do O
you H
decide O
on O
the O
stories N
? O

We H
do O
everything O
backwards O
here O
. O

We H
start O
with O
the O
headline N
and O
then O
flesh O
out H
the O
story N
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
The O
New H
York H
Times O
, O
which O
writes O
the O
issue N
and O
then O
has O
a O
headline N
editor H
to O
make O
it O
snappy O
. O

We H
start O
with O
a O
joke N
. O

We H
read O
about O
six O
hundred O
to O
eight O
hundred O
headline N
ideas N
on O
a O
Monday O
coming O
from O
our H
staff N
and O
a O
small O
group N
of O
writers H
outside O
— O
a O
contributing O
core N
. O

We H
whittle O
that O
down O
on O
a O
Monday O
to O
about O
a O
hundred O
, O
come O
in O
Tuesday O
and O
pick O
an O
issue N
and O
brainstorm O
with O
the O
whole O
editorial O
staff N
; O
all O
fifteen O
of O
us H
. O

Then O
we H
assign O
a O
headline N
to O
a O
specific O
writer H
to O
execute O
. O

We H
go O
through O
a O
number N
of O
drafts N
and O
then O
have O
the O
editors H
pick O
it O
up O
and O
assign O
the O
photojournalism N
aspect N
of O
it O
to O
our H
graphic N
design N
team N
, O
who O
adds O
the O
visual O
aspect N
to O
it O
. O

The O
editors H
punch N
it O
up O
over O
the O
last O
couple N
of O
days N
and O
then O
it O
goes O
out H
over O
the O
Internet N
and O
into O
the O
print N
edition N
. O

So O
you H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
have O
writers H
coming O
up O
with O
a O
story N
and O
headline N
, O
but O
you H
will O
instead O
have O
a O
team N
of O
writers H
choosing O
the O
best O
headlines N
and O
then O
assign O
it O
to O
a O
particular O
writer H
who O
was O
not O
necessarily O
involved O
? O

Writers H
will O
occasionally O
write O
their O
own O
headlines N
, O
but O
we H
come O
up O
with O
a O
list N
of O
15 O
or O
20 O
headline N
ideas N
, O
what O
we H
think O
will O
make O
a O
good O
story N
and O
then O
we H
assign O
it O
based O
upon O
what O
people’s O
people N
’s H
writing N
strengths N
are O
. O

We H
have O
some O
people N
who O
are O
great O
at O
politics N
; O
some O
people N
we H
give O
all O
the O
war N
stuff N
to O
; O
someone H
who O

It O
seems O
like O
some O
publications N
, O
like O
AM O
New H
York H
, O
always O
have O
a O
Britney O
Spears H
story N
; O

is O
there O
anything O
similar O
with O
The O
Onion O
where O
they O
continually O
revisit O
a O
topic N
or O
person H
? O

No O
, O
not O
necessarily O
. O

We H
are O
a O
little O
less O
reactionary O
. O

We H
tend O
to O
target N
the O
zeitgeist N
more O
than O
anything O
. O

We’ll O
We H
’ll O
hit O
the O
mainstream O
media’s O
media N
’s H
portrayal N
of O
the O
entertainment N
world N
as O
much O
as O
we’ll O
we H
’ll O
hit O
characters A
in O
the O
entertainment N
world N
. O

We’ll O
We H
’ll O
attack N
People N
Magazine’s O
Magazine O
’s H
coverage N
of O
Britney O
as O
much O
as O
Britney O
. O

In O
an O
interview N
with O
Terry H
Gross O
, O
Stephen H
Colbert H
said O
of O
his O
time N
at O
Second O
City N
that O
they O
had O
decided O
on O
not O
doing O
political O
humor N
and O
, O
in O
particular O
, O
hackneyed O
political O
humor N
such O
as O
Ted H
Kennedy H
drinking O
jokes N
. O

They O
felt N
it O
was O
overdone O
, O
mean O
- O
spirited O
and O
not O
funny O
. O

Do O
your H
writers H
have O
similar O
rules N
of O
thumb N
? O

We H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
have O
any O
rules N
or O
known O
lines N
we H
won’t O
wo O
n’t O
cross O
. O

We H
have O
an O
understanding N
based O
upon O
having O
the O
same O
writers H
in O
the O
back O
room N
for O
years N
, O
and O
those O
writers H
training N
the O
new O
writers H
as O
they O
come O
in O
. O

There O
is O
an O
understanding N
in O
the O
room N
. O

If O
it O
makes O
the O
room N
laugh O
, O
it O
probably O
ends O
up O
in O
the O
paper N
. O

One O
example N
is O
we H
ran O
an O
article N
a O
couple N
of O
years N
back O
that O
was O
, O
" O
No O
Jennifer H
Lopez H
News O
Today N
" O
. O

That O
was O
our H
reaction N
to O
all O
of O
the O
J H
- O
Lo O
stuff N
. O

We H
weren’t O
were O
n’t O
going O
to O
touch O
on O
her O
dress O
, O
or O
who O
she O
was O
dating O
. O

Just O
the O
fact N
that O
those O
were O
the O
lead O
stories N
for O
so O
many O
days N
, O
in O
everything O
from O
US O
Weekly O
to O
Time N
Magazine O
. O

I H
think O
it’s O
it O
’s H
important O
we H
have O
an O
original O
take O
on O
those O
things N
. O

I H
think O
it’s O
it O
’s H
similar O
to O
what O
Colbert H
said O
to O
Terry H
Gross O
. O

We H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
want O
to O
just O
traffic N
in O
the O
same O
24 O
hour N
news N
cycle N
. O

There’s O
There O
’s H
a O
24 O
hour N
comedy N
news N
cycle N
that O
exists O
on O
all O
the O
late O
night N
talk O
shows N
. O

The O
Onion O
has O
a O
different O
creative O
process N
where O
we H
are O
not O
trying O
to O
hit O
everything O
in O
the O
24 O
hours N
and O
on O
the O
same O
notes N
. O

We H
want O
an O
original O
take O
. O

If O
we H
choose O
to O
do O
something O
on O
J H
- O
Lo H
, O
it’s O
it O
’s H
going O
to O
be O
something O
like O
that O
, O
something O
less O
obvious O
. O

When O
you H
are O
going O
through O
the O
headlines N
, O
is O
it O
just O
you H
guys H
sitting O
around O
trying O
to O
crack O
each O
other O
up O
? O

It’s O
It O
’s H
the O
least O
amount N
of O
fun O
possible O
. O

Nah O
, O
I’m O
I H
’m O
kidding O
. O

It’s O
It O
’s H
actually O
more O
businesslike O
than O
you’d O
you H
’d O
imagine O
. O

It’s O
It O
’s H
very O
much O
like O
you H
are O
trying O
to O
make O
the O
room N
laugh O
, O
but O
the O
room N
has O
been O
a O
sort N
of O
captive O
audience N
for O
many O
many O
years N
now O
, O
so O
it O
takes O
a O
lot N
to O
make O
the O
room N
laugh O
. O

The O
best O
analogy N
I’ve O
I H
’ve O
heard O
is O
when O
Rob H
Siegel O
, O
former O
editor H
- O
in O
- O
chief O
, O
likened O
it O
to O
wine N
tasting O
. O

It’s O
It O
’s H
this O
quiet N
experience N
where O
you H
are O
trying O
to O
soak O
in O
what O
the O
joke N
is O
, O
have O
we H
done O
anything O
like O
this O
, O
is O
it O
a O
unique O
take O
, O
what O
are O
other O
people N
doing O
. O

It’s O
It O
’s H
sort N
of O
like O
, O
" O
Hmmm O
... O
that’s O
that O
’s H
hilarious O
. O
That’s O
That O
’s H
really O
really O
funny O
" O
rather O
than O
people N
falling O
off O
their O
chairs N
. O

It’s O
It O
’s H
more O
subdued O
than O
I H
think O
what O
most O
people N
would O
expect O
. O

It’s O
It O
’s H
more O
analytical O
and O
clinical O
? O

Not O
all O
the O
time N
, O
but O
it O
can’t O
ca O
n’t O
be O
a O
laugh O
a O
minute O
. O

Yeah O
, O
what O
you H
see O
on O
Studio N
60 O
and O
30 O
Rock O
, O
those O
are O
scripted O
writers H
rooms N
. O

Everything O
is O
funny O
there O
. O

There's O
There O
's H
a O
lot N
of O
unfunny O
jokes N
that O
are O
told O
in O
a O
back O
room N
, O
that's O
that O
's H
why O
they O
stay O
and O
die O
in O
that O
back O
room N
and O
don’t O
do O
n’t O
go O
out H
in O
The O
Onion O
. O

If O
someone H
is O
continually O
telling O
unfunny O
jokes N
, O
do O
you H
eventually O
fire N
them O
? O

That’s O
That O
’s H
why O
we H
are O
on O
the O
10th O
floor N
to O
make O
sure O
they O
die O
when O
they O
get O
kicked O
out H
. O

It O
can O
be O
a O
real O
mess N
on O
Broadway O
. O

By O
the O
time N
you H
get O
to O
be O
a O
writer H
for O
The O
Onion O
, O
though O
, O
the O
odds O
are O
you H
are O
going O
to O
succeed O
because O
we H
make O
it O
pretty O
challenging O
. O

You H
go O
through O
quite O
a O
bit N
. O

You H
will O
already O
have O
demonstrated O
a O
pretty O
long O
successful O
record N
of O
writing N
stuff N
for O
us H
before O
you H
will O
be O
in O
that O
room N
on O
a O
daily O
basis N
. O

But O
if O
somebody H
wakes O
up O
one N
morning N
and O
suddenly O
no O
longer O
is O
funny O
, O
then O
yeah O
, O
head N
first O
, O
out H
the O
door N
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
, O
and O
as O
sadistically O
as O
possible O
. O

The O
future N
of O
the O
peace N
process N
in O
Israel O

" O
The O
future N
is O
only O
peace N
. O
The O
problem N
is O
how O
long O
will O
it O
take O
and O
how O
many O
victims H
will O
it O
call O
for O
. O

Mr. N
President H
, O
as O
a O
Nobel O
Peace N
Prize N
recipient H
and O
as O
one N
of O
the O
fathers H
of O
the O
modern O
peace N
process N
in O
Israel O
, O
do O
you H
still O
think O
that O
there O
is O
a O
future N
to O
the O
peace N
process N
? O

The O
future N
is O
only O
peace N
. O

The O
problem N
is O
how O
long O
will O
it O
take O
and O
how O
many O
victims H
will O
it O
call O
for O
. O

Why O
do O
I H
say O
peace N
? O

Because O
when O
you H
look O
historically O
, O
at O
the O
development N
of O
humanity N
, O
most O
of O
our H
lives O
we H
are O
living O
on O
the O
land O
. O

The O
history N
is O
written O
with O
red O
ink N
. O

The O
reason N
for O
it O
is O
because O
people N
were O
fighting O
for O
our H
land O
, O
either O
defending O
it O
or O
extending O
it O
, O
because O
that O
was O
the O
main O
source N
. O

The O
land O
, O
the O
natural O
resources N
, O
the O
markets N
, O
all O
these O
go O
together O
. O

The O
minute O
the O
land O
was O
replaced O
by O
science N
, O
what O
is O
there O
to O
fight N
about O
? O

Armies N
cannot O
can O
not O
conquer O
science N
. O

Customs N
cannot O
can O
not O
check O
what O
a O
scientist H
has O
in O
his O
mind N
, O
they O
can O
see O
what O
he O
has O
in O
his O
pocket N
but O
not O
what O
he O
has O
in O
his O
mind N
so O
it’s O
it O
’s H
uncontrolled O
; O
it O
means N
that O
borders N
aren’t O
are O
n’t O
important O
and O
distances N
aren’t O
are O
n’t O
important O
. O

How O
do O
you H
approach N
the O
difficult O
challenge N
of O
talking O
to O
the O
Palestinians O
when O
, O
in O
the O
end N
, O
they O
don’t O
do O
n’t O
want O
Israel O
to O
exist O
. O

How O
do O
you H
come O
to O
an O
understanding N
to O
make O
peace N
possible O
? O

Well O
, O
what O
is O
the O
problem N
? O

I H
mean O
, O
is O
the O
problem N
national O
, O
say O
between O
Jews O
and O
Arabs O
; O
or O
is O
it O
a O
matter N
of O
generations A
between O
an O
old O
age N
and O
a O
new O
age N
? O

You H
see O
, O
the O
terrorists H
are O
protesting O
against O
modernity N
. O

They O
think O
that O
modernity N
may O
endanger O
their O
tradition N
. O

They O
are O
simply O
afraid O
and O
hate O
modernity N
. O

They O
consider O
modernity N
as O
their O
enemy N
, O
but O
then O
they O
have O
two O
problems N
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
can O
they O
exist O
on O
tradition N
? O

They O
cannot O
can O
not O
. O

Sooner O
or O
later O
they O
will O
have O
to O
enter O
the O
new O
age N
. O

All O
the O
talks N
about O
nationalities N
, O
etcetera O
, O
well O
, O
the O
new O
age N
has O
very O
little O
patience N
for O
history N
. O

History N
is O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
irrelevant O
. O

How O
do O
you H
feel O
about O
that O
? O

Well O
, O
I H
distinguish O
between O
two O
histories N
, O
the O
spiritual O
and O
the O
material O
. O

Or O
the O
history N
of O
events N
and O
the O
history N
of O
values N
. O

The O
history N
of O
values N
is O
okay O
because O
wisdom N
is O
ageless O
; O
it O
doesn’t O
does O
n’t O
grow O
old O
, O
like O
material O
. O

But O
events N
are O
totally O
unimportant O
for O
2 O
reasons N
. O

First O
, O
the O
event N
is O
unimportant O
. O

Tell O
me H
, O
what O
events N
is O
today N
important O
such O
as O
how O
many O
elephants A
Hannibal H
had O
on O
the O
Alps O
, O
when O
you H
can O
have O
helicopters N
? O

Why O
should O
I H
bother O
my H
children H
with O
all O
this O
nonsense N
? O

What O
sort N
of O
a O
nose N
did O
Cleopatra H
have O
? O

God H
, O
I H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
know O
! O

You H
can O
invite O
people N
to O
war N
over O
noses N
, O
but O
nobody H
will O
go O
to O
fight N
for O
noses N
any O
more O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand N
, O
there O
are O
already O
machines N
that O
can O
replace O
our H
memory N
. O

Why O
should O
I H
bother O
my H
child H
with O
memory N
when O
he O
can O
buy O
a O
computer N
that O
will O
remember O
everything O
you H
asked O
him O
to O
remember O
? O

The O
waning O
importance N
of O
history N

Isn’t O
Is O
n’t O
the O
answer N
to O
that O
question N
that O
wise O
decisions N
are O
made O
with O
a O
basis N
from O
memory N
? O

Although O
a O
computer N
can O
have O
… O

No O
, O
no O
. O

Forget O
memory N
. O

Look O
, O
the O
new O
age N
is O
unprecedented O
. O

When O
something O
is O
unprecedented O
, O
it O
means N
it O
doesn’t O
does O
n’t O
have O
a O
past N
, O
doesn’t O
does O
n’t O
have O
a O
history N
. O

It’s O
It O
’s H
totally O
oriented O
on O
the O
future N
. O

And O
whoever O
dwells O
in O
the O
past N
, O
doesn’t O
does O
n’t O
understand O
the O
future N
because O
the O
past N
is O
full O
of O
prejudices N
, O
of O
commitments N
. O

It O
arrests O
us H
. O

And O
then O
you H
say O
you H
won’t O
wo O
n’t O
commit O
a O
mistake N
, O
so O
you’ll O
you H
’ll O
commit O
new O
mistakes N
. O

It O
doesn’t O
does O
n’t O
matter N
. O

`` O
I H
say O
brains N
is O
the O
greater O
producer N
of O
wealth N
, O
not O
oil N
. O

It’s O
It O
’s H
limitless O
, O
and O
you’ll O
you H
’ll O
see O
that O
the O
GNP N
of O
Israel O
is O
very O
close O
to O
the O
Saudis’ O
Saudis O
’ O
. O

So O
they O
are O
3 O
times N
larger O
than O
us H
and O
they O
have O
all O
the O
oil N
in O
the O
world N
. O

We H
have O
brains N
. O
" O

— O
Peres O
, O
on O
whether O
the O
Arab O
states' O
states N
' O
oil N
wealth N
will O
eclipse O
Israel's O
Israel O
's H
prominence N
in O
the O
region N
. O

What O
about O
the O
adage N
, O
“ O
Those O
who O
forget O
history N
are O
doomed O
to O
repeat O
it O
” O
? O

So O
they O
will O
make O
new O
mistakes N
. O

Mistake N
is O
inevitable O
as O
long O
as O
there O
are O
human O
beings A
. O

But O
you H
cannot O
can O
not O
repeat O
mistakes N
because O
the O
world N
is O
not O
built O
on O
repetition N
; O
it’s O
it O
’s H
built O
on O
mutation N
. O

Don’t O
Do O
n’t O
you H
think O
Darfur O
is O
repetition N
? O

I H
think O
Darfur O
is O
, O
again O
, O
the O
last O
, O
or O
among O
the O
last O
battles N
between O
old O
and O
new O
. O

What O
are O
they O
fighting O
for O
? O

What O
are O
they O
killing O
killing O
killing O
over O
? O

They O
don’t O
do O
n’t O
carry O
futures N
. O

It’s O
It O
’s H
not O
a O
mistake N
. O

It O
belongs O
to O
a O
past N
. O

It O
doesn’t O
does O
n’t O
have O
a O
moment N
. O

I H
am O
sure O
that O
the O
reasons N
for O
war N
are O
over O
, O
even O
though O
still O
there O
are O
wars N
which O
are O
an O
inertia N
from O
the O
past N
, O
a O
continuation N
that O
doesn’t O
does O
n’t O
make O
sense N
. O

I’m O
I H
’m O
answering O
your H
question N
. O

The O
problem N
is O
how O
to O
enable O
the O
whole O
world N
to O
enter O
the O
new O
future N
, O
including O
the O
Arabs O
. O

And O
there O
are O
already O
Arabs O
who O
did O
it O
. O

Look O
at O
Turkey O
, O
who O
is O
knocking O
on O
the O
doors N
of O
the O
united O
Europe O
. O

Why O
? O

It’s O
It O
’s H
not O
a O
geographic O
endeavor N
, O
it O
is O
an O
intellectual O
endeavor N
. O

They O
say O
you H

Muslim O

the O
moment N

Interview O

Aner O
Shalev O

What O
are O
you H
going O
to O
talk O
about O
here O
in O
Levico O
? O

I H
called O
it O
Character O
, O
walks O
and O
words N
. O

There O
is O
a O
whole O
topic N
which O
is O
called O
asymptotic O
groups N
theory N
. O

There O
are O
groups N
which O
express O
the O
symmetry N
of O
some O
structures N
. O

Studying O
groups N
is O
a O
bit N
like O
studying O
symmetry N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
very O
beautiful O
I H
think O
. O

And O
then O
when O
you H
do O
it O
in O
an O
asymptotic O
way N
is O
like O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
look O
at O
the O
small O
details N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
like O
from O
the O
sky O
. O

You H
look O
at O
the O
general O
patterns N
. O

And O
there O
is O
another O
topic N
which O
is O
very O
important O
in O
mathematics N
which O
is O
called O
representation N
theory N
. O

So O
I H
will O
mainly O
talk O
about O
how O
to O
use H
a O
representation N
theory N
to O
solve O
all O
kind N
of O
problems N
and O
conjectures N
in O
asymptotic O
groups N
theory N
. O

Why O
did O
you H
choose O
to O
study O
mathematics N
? O

First O
of O
all O
because O
it O
was O
beautiful O
. O

When O
I H
was O
ten O
my H
father H
already O
showed O
me H
some O
stuff N
in O
mathematics N
and O
the O
beauty N
and O
the O
imagination N
was O
quite O
apparent O
. O

I H
also O
like O
the O
freedom N
in O
mathematics N
. O

If O
you H
study O
physics N
or O
chemistry N
then O
you H
should O
describe O
the O
real O
world N
. O

But O
in O
mathematics N
you H
can O
build O
your H
own O
structures N
. O

You H
can O
walk O
in O
worlds N
created O
by O
the O
imagination N
of O
people N
. O

You're O
You H
're O
not O
committed O
to O
the O
real O
world N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
almost O
like O
God H
to O
some O
extent N
. O

You H
can O
create O
worlds N
, O
you H
can O
study O
them O
. O

I H
think O
it's O
it O
's H
a O
combination N
of O
the O
beauty N
, O
of O
the O
imagination N
, O
of O
the O
freedom N
. O

Many O
people N
, O
and O
many O
students H
, O
dislike N
math N
. O

Why O
do O
you H
think O
it O
is O
so O
? O

First O
of O
all O
I H
think O
maybe O
they O
have O
bad O
teachers H
, O
which O
is O
a O
problem N
. O

You H
have O
to O
have O
very O
good O
teachers H
in O
mathematics N
if O
you H
really O
want O
to O
enjoy O
and O
to O
succeed O
in O
it O
. O

Probably O
some O
people N
mainly O
think O
about O
the O
scientific O
part N
of O
it O
– O
you H
have O
to O
be O
accurate O
- O
and O
they O
see O
less O
these O
elements N
of O
the O
freedom N
, O
and O
the O
imagination N
, O
and O
creation N
. O

Maybe O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
precise O
nature N
of O
mathematics N
. O

Also O
when O
I H
talk O
mathematics N
I H
notice O
the O
language N
is O
very O
important O
in O
mathematics N
and O
I H
actually O
notice O
that O
many O
times N
people N
fail O
in O
mathematics N
because O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
write O
a O
composition N
. O

They O
have O
ideas N
but O
they O
cannot O
can O
not O
formulate O
them O
in O
the O
right O
way N
. O

Actually O
I H
find O
many O
connections N
between O
mathematics N
and O
literature N
because O
almost O
all O
the O
thing N
I H
told O
about O
mathematics N
are O
also O
seen O
in O
literature N
and O
in O
writing N
because O
when O
you H
write O
you H
can O
describe O
the O
real O
world N
, O
but O
you H
can O
also O
create O
worlds N
of O
fiction N
. O

So O
you H
have O
imagination N
, O
you H
have O
total N
freedom N
, O
you H
can O
invent O
characters A
, O
you H
can O
invent O
all O
kind N
of O
development N
and O
surprises N
and O
this O
kind N
of O
end N
of O
story N
or O
another O
. O

Also O
the O
language N
is O
important O
in O
writing N
and O
in O
literature N
. O

So O
in O
a O
way N
people N
often O
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
combine O
the O
two O
fields N
. O

It O
could O
look O
like O
almost O
the O
opposite N
: O
literature N
is O
kind N
of O
arts N
and O
mathematics N
is O
science N
but O
they O
also O
see O
a O
lot N
in O
common O
and O
there O
where O
mathematician H
who O
were O
writers H
. O

For O
example N
the O
most O
famous O
is O
Lewis H
Carrol O
, O
author H
of O
Alice H
in O
Wonderland O
. O

You're O
You H
're O
not O
only O
a O
mathematician H
. O

You H
also O
wrote O
two O
collections N
of O
short O
stories N
and O
a O
novel N
. O

Why O
did O
you H
begin O
to O
write O
? O

When O
I H
was O
quite O
young O
I H
was O
interested O
in O
psychoanalysis N
and O
in O
dreams N
. O

I H
was O
trying O
to O
interpret O
my H
dreams N
. O

I H
started O
to O
write O
down O
my H
dreams N
. O

And O
then O
I H
noticed O
that O
I H
cheat O
a O
little O
bit N
when O
I H
write O
them O
down O
. O

Sometimes O
I H
make O
them O
more O
pretty O
then O
they O
were O
actually O
. O

So O
instead O
of O
documenting O
the O
dreams N
it O
gradually O
became O
also O
like O
adding O
creational O
elements N
, O
and O
I H
think O
that O
somehow O
through O
writing N
my H
dreams N
I H
gradually O
came O
to O
writing N
, O
also O
poems N
, O
but O
mainly O
stories N
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
a O
little O
bit N
inspired O
by O
dreams N
but O
when O
eventually O
I H
started O
to O
write O
more O
seriously O
I H
was O
more O
interested O
in O
structure N
which O
also O
.. O
a O
bit N
like O
mathematics N
in O
a O
way N
.. O
for O
example N
my H
first O
book O
is O
called O
Opus O
1 O
.. O
a O
collection N
of O
four O
long O
stories N
with O
musical N
structures N
. O

The O
first O
part N
is O
called O
Legato O
and O
the O
second N
part N
was O
called O
Staccato O
. O

In O
the O
legato O
part N
the O
sentences N
are O
very O
long O
and O
without O
breaks O
almost O
like O
stream O
of O
consciousness N
. O

In O
the O
staccato O
part N
it's O
it O
's H
like O
a O
music N
: O
a O
lot N
of O
break O
, O
very O
very O
short O
sentences N
. O

It O
was O
a O
bit N
experimenting O
connections N
between O
the O
language N
and O
the O
music N
and O
the O
psychology N
of O
people N
. O

In O
the O
second N
book O
I H
made O
another O
experiment O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
a O
book O
of O
opening N
, O
Overtures N
I H
called O
it O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
end N
to O
the O
stories N
. O

There O
are O
seventy O
beginning O
of O
stories N
without O
ends O
. O

In O
the O
novel N
Dark O
Matters O
I H
think O
what O
interested O
me H
in O
the O
structure N
was O
two O
thing N
: O
simple O
narrative N
and O
email N
. O

It O
keeps O
changing O
between O
narrative N
and O
email N
. O

Another O
thing N
was O
two O
different O
time N
scapes N
: O
one N
goes O
very O
slow O
and O
one N
goes O
very O
fast O
and O
they O
almost O
kind N
of O
meet O
in O
the O
end N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
a O
little O
bit N
like O
Achilles H
and O
the O
turtle A
. O

... O
love O
story N
and O
romance O
and O
surprises N
and O
tragedies N
and O
all O
this O
but O
also O
this O
structure N
interested O
me H
a O
lot N
. O

Why O
did O
you H
choose O
this O
particular O
structure N
? O

When O
I H
tell O
stories N
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
like O
that O
everything O
will O
be O
clear N
from O
the O
beginning O
. O

I H
like O
that O
something O
will O
be O
a O
bit N
of O
secret O
, O
or O
even O
unreliable O
narrator H
: O
someone H
tells O
something O
and O
first O
you H
trust N
him O
but O
then O
you H
read O
more O
and O
you H
become O
thrilled O
by O
everything O
. O

I H
think O
by O
using O
emails N
on O
the O
one N
hand N
which O
are O
more O
the O
voice H
of O
the O
woman H
Eva H
and O
narrative N
which O
is O
more O
the O
perspective N
of O
the O
man H
Adam H
, O
I H
kind N
of O
confront O
them O
, O
their O
different O
perspective N
and O
then O
kind N
somehow O
you H
can O
see O
the O
distortions N
in O
the O
way N
the O
story N
is O
told O
. O

I H
think O
that O
in O
this O
kind N
of O
structure N
there O
is O
a O
very O
gradual O
clarification N
of O
the O
relationship N
and O
the O
forth O
going O
on O
. O

Keep O
your H
eyes N
peeled O
for O

Stardust O
is O
a O
NASA O
space N

that O
collected O
samples N
from O

81P/Wild O
( O
also O
known O
as O

) O
in O
deep O
space N
and O
landed O
back O
on O
Earth O
on O
January O
15 O
, O
2006 O
. O

It O
was O
decided O
that O
a O
collaborative O

process N
would O
be O
used O
to O
" O
discover O
" O
the O
microscopically O
small O

collected O
. O

The O

Unlike O
distributed O

SETI O
@ O

Stardust O
is O
a O
NASA O
Discovery O
mission N
that O
was O
launched O
in O
1999 O
. O

It O
is O
really O
two O
missions N
in O
one N
. O

The O
primary O
science N
goal N
of O
the O
mission N
was O
to O
collect O
a O
sample N
from O
a O
known O
primitive O
solar O
- O
system N
body N
, O
a O
comet N
called O
Wild O
2 O
( O
pronounced O
" O
Vilt O
- O
two O
" O
— O
the O
discoverer H
was O
German O
, O
I H
believe O
) O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
US O
" O
sample N
return O
" O
mission N
since O
Apollo O
, O
and O
the O
first O
ever O
from O
beyond O
the O
moon N
. O

This O
gives O
a O
little O
context N
. O

By O
" O
sample N
return O
" O
of O
course N
I H
mean O
a O
mission N
that O
brings O
back O
extraterrestrial O
material O
. O

I H
should O
have O
said O
above O
that O
this O
is O
the O
first O
" O
solid N
" O
sample N
return O
mission N
— O

Genesis O
brought O
back O
a O
sample N
from O
the O
Sun O
almost O
two O
years N
ago O
, O
but O
Stardust O
is O
also O
bringing O
back O
the O
first O
solid N
samples N
from O
the O
local O
interstellar O
medium N
— O

basically O
this O
is O
a O
sample N
of O
the O
Galaxy N
. O

This O
is O
absolutely O
unprecedented O
, O
and O
we're O
we H
're O
obviously O
incredibly O
excited O
. O

I H
should O
mention N
parenthetically O
that O
there O
is O
a O
fantastic O
launch N
video N
— O
taken O
from O
the O
POV O
of O
the O
rocket N
on O
the O
JPL O
Stardust O
website N
— O
highly O
recommended O
— O
best O
I've O
I H
've O
ever O
seen O
— O
all O
the O
way N
from O
the O
launch N
pad N
, O
too O
. O

Basically O
interplanetary O
trajectory N
. O

Absolutely O
great O
. O

Is O
the O
video N
available O
to O
the O
public O
? O

Yes O
[ O
see O
below O
] O
. O

OK O
, O
I H
digress O
. O

The O
first O
challenge N
that O
we H
have O
before O
can O
do O
any O
kind N
of O
analysis N
of O
these O
interstellar O
dust N
particles N
is O
simply O
to O
find O
them O
. O

This O
is O
a O
big O
challenge N
because O
they O
are O
very O
small O
( O
order O
of O
micron N
in O
size N
) O
and O
are O
somewhere O
( O
we H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
) O
on O
a O
HUGE O
collector H
— O
at O
least O
on O
the O
scale N
of O
the O
particle N
size N
— O
about O
a O
tenth N
of O
a O
square N
meter N
. O

So O
... O

We're O
We H
're O
right O
now O
using O
an O
automated O
microscope N
that O
we H
developed O
several O
years N
ago O
for O
nuclear O
astrophysics N
work N
to O
scan O
the O
collector H
in O
the O
Cosmic O
Dust N
Lab O
in O
Building O
31 O
at O
Johnson H
Space N
Center O
. O

This O
is O
the O
ARES O
group N
that O
handles O
returned O
samples N
( O
Moon O

, O
and O
Interplanetary O

. O

The O
microscope N
collects O
stacks N
of O
digital O
images N
of O
the O
aerogel O
collectors N
in O
the O
array N
. O

These O
images N
are O
sent O
to O

— O
we H
compress O
them O
and O
convert O
them O
into O
a O
format N
appropriate O
for O
Stardust O

How O
many O
samples N
do O
you H
anticipate O
being O
found O
during O
the O
course N
of O
the O
project N
? O

Great H
question N
. O

The O
short O
answer N
is O
that O
we H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

The O
long O
answer N
is O
a O
bit N
more O
complicated O
. O

Here's O
Here O
's H
what O
we H
know O
. O

The O
Galileo O
and O
Ulysses O
spacecraft N
carried O
dust N
detectors N
onboard O
that O
Eberhard O
Gruen O
and O
his O
colleagues H
used O
to O
first O
detect O
and O
them O
measure N
the O
flux N
of O
interstellar O
dust N
particles N
streaming O
into O
the O
solar O
system N
. O

( O
This O
is O
a O
kind N
of O
" O
wind N
" O
of O
interstellar O
dust N
, O
caused O
by O
the O
fact N
that O
our H
solar O
system N
is O
moving O
with O
respect N
to O
the O
local O
interstellar O
medium N
. O
) O

Markus H
Landgraf O
has O
estimated O
the O
number N
of O
interstellar O
dust N
particles N
that O
should O
have O
been O
captured O
by O
Stardust O
during O
two O
periods N
of O
the O
" O
cruise N
" O
phase N
of O
the O
interplanetary O
orbit N
in O
which O
the O
spacecraft N
was O
moving O
with O
this O
wind N
. O

He O
estimated O
that O
there O
should O
be O
around O
45 O
particles N
, O
but O
this O
number N
is O
very O
uncertain O
— O
I H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
be O
surprised O
if O
it O
is O
quite O
different O
from O
that O
. O

That O
was O
the O
long O
answer N
! O

One O
thing N
that O
I H
should O
say O
... O
is O
that O
like O
all O
research N
, O
the O
outcome N
of O
what O

There O
is O
a O
wonderful O
quote N
attributed O
to O
Einstein H
— O
" O
If O
we H
knew O
what O
we H
were O
doing O
, O
it O
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
be O
called O
" O
research N
" O
, O
would O
it O
? O
" O

How O
big O
would O
the O
samples N
be O
? O

We H
expect O
that O
the O
particles N
will O
be O
of O
order O
a O
micron N
in O
size N
. O

( O
A H
millionth N
of O
a O
meter N
. O
) O

When O
people N
are O
searching O
using O
the O
virtual O
microscope N
, O
they O
will O
be O
looking O
not O
for O
the O
particles N
, O
but O
for O
the O
tracks N
that O
the O
particles N
make O
, O
which O
are O
much O
larger O
— O
several O
microns N
in O
diameter N
. O

Just O
yesterday N
we H
switched O
over O
to O
a O
new O
site N
which O
has O
a O
demo N
of O
the O
VM O
( O
virtual O
microscope N
) O
I H
invite O
you H
to O
check O
it O
out H
. O

The O
tracks N
in O
the O
demo N
are O
from O
submicron O
carbonyl N
iron N
particles N
that O
were O
shot N
into O
aerogel O
using O
a O
particle N
accelerator N
modified O
to O
accelerate O
dust N
particles N
to O
very O
high O

and O
a O
zip N

from O
the O
Scientology H
organization N
after O
leaving O

an O
article N

which O
attacked O
high O
- O
ranking O
defectors H
from O
the O

including O
Tom H
Devocht O
and O
Mark H
Rathbun O
. O

Montalvo O
had O
known O
Devocht O
personally O
, O
and O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion N
that O
the O
claims N
made O
about O
him O
in O
the O
Freedom N
article N
were O
lies N

Montalvo O
was O
subsequently O
motivated O

him O
leave O

get O
in O
touch O
with O

He O
traveled O

would O
assist O
him O

According O

Scientology H

Montalvo O
was O

Rathbun O
wrote O

at O
an O
estimated O

of O
NZ O
$ O
26 O

, O
although O
a O
recent O
poll N
found O
only O
a O
quarter N

a O
decrease O

when O
it O
was O
forty O

As O
with O
all O
new O

celebrations N
in O
Taiwan O
, O
the O
lantern N
festival N
is O
crowded O
. O

People N
flock O
to O
see O
the O
lantern N
scenes N
and O
enjoy O
the O
festival N
atmosphere N
as O
they O
carry O
lanterns N
, O
given O
away O
by O
the O

bought O
from O

Local O
public O

often O
swamped O
by O
the O

The O
station N
staff N
at O
Chiang H
Kai O
Shek O
Memorial O
Hall H
Station O
do O
an O
excellent O
job N
of O
crowd N
control N
but O
lines N
for O
the O
subway N
can O
still O
be O
hours N
long O
and O
very O
exhausting O
. O

A H
sudden O
rain N
storm N
on O
Sunday O
night N
( O
March O
4 O
) O
caused O
a O
mass O
exodus N
of O
people N
to O
head N
for O
the O
station N
prompting O
lines N
that O
backed O
up O
into O
the O
street N
. O

The O
commuting O
crowds N
can O
be O
avoided O
however O
by O
walking O
from O
NTU O
Hospital O
Station O
or O
Shandao O
Station O
. O

Both O
of O
these O
stops N
are O
only O
about O
a O
20 O
minute O
walk O
from O
the O
event N
and O
have O
no O
crowds N
at O
all O
. O

If O
you H
really O
want O
to O
avoid O
the O
crowds N
, O
definitely O
avoid O
the O
weekends N
. O

Wait O
until O
the O
fourth O
or O
fifth O
day N
of O
the O
festival N
when O
the O
crowds N
will O
have O
dwindled O
. O

I H
visited O
the O
festival N
on O
Saturday O
night N
, O
the O
opening N
night N
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
sea N
of O
people N
in O
the O

. O

I H
went O
back O
the O
next O
Tuesday O
night N
and O
there O
was O
almost O
no O

just O
a O

In O

The O
request N

results N

the O
sentence N

the O
Italian O
Supreme O
Court N

Cassation O
on O
July O

, O
recognising O
as O
legitimate O
the O
request N

the O

pay O
property N

Requests N

come O
from O

from O

Stelle O
( O
M5S O
) O
of O
the O
regional O
counsel H
of O
Lombardy O
. O

The O
first O
case N
is O
of O
the O
mayor H
Luca H
Pastorino O
that O
in O
last O
years N
received O
several O
refusals N
of O
his O
requests N

of O
the O
religious O
nursery N

retirement N
home N

In O
the O
second N
case N
, O
the O
M5S O
party N
asks O
to O
the O
regional O

assure O
the O
local O
administrations N

the O
region N
regularly O
apply O
the O
sentence N

The O
case N
on O
which O
the O
Court N

ruled O
was O
of O
the O

Santo O
Spirito O

Immacolata O
in O
Livorno O

, O
to O
pay O
over O
422,000 O

the O
period N

The O
request N
was O
advanced O
by O
the O
Municipality O
of O
Livorno O
in O
2010 O
. O

The O
city N
reasoned O
, O
" O
because O
the O
users H
of O
the O
private O
schools N
pay O
a O
frequency N
fee N
, O
this O
kind N

activity N
is O
considered O

a O
commercial O
one N
" O
( O
( O
it O
) O
) O
. O

In O
2014 O
the O
Italian O
municipal O
tax N
discipline O
has O
changed O
from O
the O
ICI O
system N

the O
IMU O
system N
by O
the O
Monti O
government N

A H
mean O

only O

fixed O
by O
the O
State N

The O
new O
law N
is O
not O
retroactive O

so O
the O

" O
People N

still O
intrigued O

Wilkins H
explained O
Warhol's O
Warhol O

began O
when O

Warhol's O
Warhol O
's H
photographic O
legacy N

Warhol O
was O
close O
to O
important O
touchstones N
of O
the O
1960s N
, O
including O
art N
, O
music N
, O
consumer H
culture N
, O
fashion N
, O
and O
celebrity N
worship N
, O
which O
were O
all O
buzzwords N
and O
images N
Wikinews O
observed O
at O
USI's O
USI O
's H
opening N
exhibit N
. O

He O
was O
also O
an O
influential O
figure O
in O
the O
pop N
art N
movement N
. O

" O
Pop N
art N
was O
about O
what O
popular O
American O
culture N
really O
thought O
was O
important O
" O
, O
Kathryn H
Waters H
said O
. O

" O
That's O
That O
's H
why O
he O
did O
the O
Campbell H
Soup O
cans N
or O
the O
Marilyn O
pictures N
, O
these O
iconic O
products N
of O
American O
culture N
whether O
they O
be O
in O
film N
, O
video N
or O
actually O
products N
we H
consumed O
. O

So O
even O
back O
in O
the O
sixties N
, O
he O
was O
very O
aware O
of O
this O
part N
of O
our H
culture N
. O

Which O
as O
we H
all O
know O
in O
2014 O
, O
has O
only O
increased O
probably O
a O
thousand O
fold N
. O
" O

" O
I H
think O
everybody O
knows O
Andy H
Warhol's O
Warhol O
's H
name N
, O
even O
non-art O
people N
, O
that's O
that O
's H
a O
name N
they O
might O
know O
because O
he O
was O
such O
a O
personality N
" O
, O
Water N
said O
. O

Hilary H
Braysmith O
, O
USI O
associate O
professor H
of O
art N
history N
, O
said O
, O
" O
I H
think O
his O
photography N
is O
equally O
influential O
as O
his O
graphic N
works O
, O
his O
more O
famous O
pictures N
of O
Marilyn H
. O

In O
terms N
of O
the O
evolution N
of O
photography N
and O
experimentation N
, O
like O
painting O
on O
them O
or O
the O
celebrity N
fascination N
, O
I H
think O
he O
was O
really O
ground N
- O
breaking O
in O
that O
regard N
. O
" O

The O
Polaroid O
format N
is O
not O
what O
made O
Warhol O
famous O
, O
however O
, O
he O
is O
in O
the O
company N
of O
other O
well O
- O
known O
photographers H
who O
used O
the O
camera N
, O
such O
as O
Ansel O
Adams H
, O
Chuck H
Close H
, O
Walker H
Evans H
, O
Robert H
Mapplethorpe O
, O
and O
Helmut H
Newton H
. O

Wilkins H
said O
, O
" O
[ O
Warhol O
] O
liked O
the O
way N
photo N
booths N
and O
the O
Polaroid's O
Polaroid O
's H
front N
flash N
looked O
" O
. O

She O
explained O
how O
Warhol's O
Warhol O
's H
adoption N
of O
the O
Polaroid O
camera N
revealed O
his O
process N
. O

According O
to O
Wilkins H
, O
Warhol O
was O
able O
to O
reproduce O
the O
Polaroid O
photograph N
and O
create O
an O
enlargement N
of O
it O
, O
which O
he O
then O
could O
use H
to O
commit O
the O
image N
to O
the O
silk N
screen N
medium N
by O
applying O
paint O
or O
manipulating O
them O
further O
. O

One O
of O
the O
silk N
screens N
exhibited O
at O
USI O
this O
time N
was O
the O
Annie H
Oakley O
screen N
print N
called O
" O
Cowboys O
and O
Indians H
" O
from O
1987 O
. O

Wilkins H
also O
said O
Warhol O
was O
both O
an O
artist H
and O
a O
businessperson H
. O

" O
As O
a O
way N
to O
commercialize O
his O
work N
, O
he O
would O
make O
a O
blue O
Marilyn H
and O
a O
pink O
Marilyn H
and O
a O
yellow O
Marilyn H
, O
and O
then O
you H
could O
pick O
your H
favorite O
color N
and O
buy O
that O
. O

It O
was O
a O
very O
practical O
salesman H
approach N
to O
his O
work N
. O

He O
was O
very O
prolific O
but O
very O
business N
minded O
about O
that O
. O
" O

" O
He O
wanted O
to O
be O
rich O
and O
famous O
and O
he O
made O
lots N
of O
choices N
to O
go O
that O
way N
" O

Kiara O
Perkins H

admitted O
she O
was O
willing O

then O
circumstances N
allowed O
for O

Why O
did O
she O
so O
badly O

" O
It's O
It O

He O
is O
a O
legend N

" O

For O
Kevin H
Allton O
, O
a O
USI O
instructor H
in O
English O
, O
Warhol O
was O
also O
a O
legend N
. O

He O
said O
, O
" O
Andy H
Warhol O
was O
the O
center N
of O
the O
Zeitgeist N
for O
the O
20th O
century N

everything O
since O
. O

He O
is O

diety O

" O

Allton O
said O
he O
had O
only O
seen O
the O
Silver O
Clouds O
installation N
before O
in O
film N
. O

The O
Silver O
Clouds O
installation N
were O
silver N
balloons N
blown O
up O
with O
helium N
, O
and O
those O
balloons N
filled O
one N
of O
the O
smaller O
rooms N

" O
I H
thought O
that O
in O

it O
was O
really O
kind N

magical O

" O
Allton O
said O

" O
I H
smacked O
them O
around O

In O
her O
opening N
remarks N
for O
attendees H
, O
Waters H
pointed O
out H
those O
features O
to O
attendees H
, O
noting O
the O
touches N
of O
the O
Warhol O
Factory O
, O
or O
the O
studio N
where O
he O
worked O
, O
that O
were O
present N
around O
them O
. O

She O
pointed O
to O
the O
refreshment N
table N
with O
Campbell's O
Campbell H

with O
" O
electric O
" O
Kool O

and O
tables N
adorned O
with O
colorful O
gumball O

. O

The O
music N
in O
the O
background N
was O
from O
such O
bands N
as O
The O
Velvet O
Underground O
. O

The O
big O
hit O
of O
the O
evening N
, O
Wikinews O
observed O
from O
the O
long O
line N
, O
was O
the O
Polaroid O
- O
room N
where O
attendees H
could O
wear O
a O
Warhol O
- O
like O
wig N
or O
don O
crazy O
glasses N
and O
have O
their O
own O
Polaroid O
taken O
. O

The O
Polaroids N
were O
ready O
in O
an O
instant O
and O
immediately O
displayed O
at O
the O
entry N
of O
the O
exhibit N
. O

Exhibit N
goers H
then O
became O
part N
of O
the O
very O
exhibit N
they O
had O
wanted O
to O
attend O
. O

In O
fact N
, O
many O
people N
Wikinews O
observed O
took O
out H
their O
mobiles N
as O
they O
left O
for O
the O
evening N
and O
used O
their O
own O
phone N
cameras N
to O
make O
one N
further O
record N
of O
the O
moment N
- O
a O
photo N
of O
a O
photo N
. O

Perhaps O
they O
had O
learned O
an O
important O
lesson N
from O
the O
Warhol O
exhibit N
that O
cultural O
events N
like O
these O
were O
ripe O
for O
use H
and O

A H
research N
team N
from O
the O
Massachusetts O
Institute N
of O
Technology O
and O
Colorado O
State N
University N
of O
the O
US O
and O
the O
University N
of O
Sheffield O
of O
the O
UK O
has O
analysed O
effects N
of O
global O
warming O
and O
ozone N
pollution N
over O
2000 O
- O
2050 O
on O
the O
worldwide O
production N
of O
wheat A
, O
rice N
, O
maize A
and O
soybean N
. O

The O
study O
was O
published O
in O
journal N
Nature H
Climate N
Change N
yesterday N
. O

The O
scientists H
found O
reduction N
of O
crop N
yields N
by O
2050 O
exceeded O
10 O
% O
of O
2000 O
levels N
, O
substantially O
decreasing O
food N
security N
, O
in O
all O
cases N
examined O
. O

Several O
scenarios N
were O
considered O
because O
of O
uncertainty N
of O
future N
levels N
of O
ozone N
pollution N
. O

They O
estimated O
by O
2050 O
, O
increasing O
population N
and O
changing O
diet N
would O
increase O
world N
food N
needs N
by O
50 O
percent N
. O

As O
coauthor H
Colette O
Heald O
told O
The O
Huffington O
Post O
, O
" O
The O
climate N
projections N
are O
quite O
consistent O
[...] O

the O
future N
of O
ozone N
pollution N
is O
very O
different O
[...] O
leading N
to O
either O
offsetting O
or O
reinforcing O
effects N
[ O
of O
climate N
change O
] O
on O
crops N
" O
. O

By O
2050 O
, O
undernourishment N
would O
increase O
by O
either O
49 O
percent N
or O
by O
27 O
percent N
, O
depending O
on O
the O
scenario N
. O

The O
study O
focuses O
on O
ozone N
- O
temperature N
covariation N
: O
ground N
- O
level N
ozone N
increases O
with O
temperatures N
. O

Heald O
said O
although O
temperature N
and O
ozone N
are O
separately O
known O
to O
impact N
crop N
yields N
, O
" O
nobody H
has O
looked O
at O
these O
together O
" O
. O

Depending O
on O
region N
and O
crops N
, O
the O
yields N
may O
be O
primarily O
sensitive O
to O
ozone N
- O
in O
the O
case N
of O
wheat A
- O
or O
heat N
- O
in O
the O
case N
of O
maize A
- O
alone O
, O
providing O
a O
local O
estimation N
of O
relative O
benefits N
of O
climate N
change O
adaptation N
versus O
ozone N
regulation N
. O

The O
U.S. O
Department O
of O
Agriculture O
notes N
, O
" O
Ground N

ozone N
causes N
more O
damage N
to O
plants A
than O
all O
other O

Results N
of O
NCLAN O
studies N
, O
published O
in O
a O
paper N
by O
AS O
Heagle O
in O
1989 O
, O
show O
dicot A
species A
, O
such O
as O
soybean N
, O
cotton N
, O
and O
peanut N
, O
lose O
more O
yield N
from O
ozone N
than O
do O
monocot A
species A
such O
as O
sorghum A
, O
field N
corn N
, O
and O
winter N
wheat A
. O

The O
researchers H
found O
that O
ozone N
pollution N
caused O
46 O
percent N
of O
previously O
heat N
- O
attributed O
damage N
to O
soybean N
crops N
. O

The O
model N
does O
not O
include O
the O
effect N
of O
rising O
carbon N
dioxide N
concentration N
, O
which O
has O
complex O
and O
potentially O
offsetting O
impacts N
on O
global O
food N
supply N
. O

The O
U.S. O
Environmental O
Protection O
Agency O
says O
some O
crops N
may O
have O
higher O
yields N
with O
increased O
levels N
of O
carbon N
dioxide N
. O

However O
, O
global O
warming O
also O
increases O
probability N
of O
extreme O
crops N
- O
damaging O
weather N
events N
such O
as O
floods O
, O
droughts N
, O
and O
extreme O
temperatures N
. O

Climate N
change O
affects O
distribution N
of O
weeds A
, O
pests N
, O
and O
diseases N
. O

Heald O
noted O
the O
findings N
show O
pollution N
reduction N
is O
also O
important O
. O

" O
An O
air N
- O
quality N
cleanup N
would O
improve O
crop N
yields N
[...] O

Ozone N
is O
something O
that O
we H
understand O
the O
causes N
of O
, O
and O
the O
steps N
that O
need O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
improve O
air N
quality N
. O
" O

As O
Heald O
told O
The O
Huffington O
Post O
, O
US O
surface N
ozone N
has O
dropped O
partly O
due O
to O
the O
Clean O
Air O
Act O
. O

" O
Despite O
an O
increase O
in O
vehicle N
miles N
driven O
and O
energy N
consumption N
, O
surface N
ozone N
has O
declined O
by O
25 O
percent N
on O
average O
across O
the O
U.S. O
from O
1980 O
to O
2012 O
[...] O

However O
, O
the O
future N
of O
ozone N
air N
quality N
in O
the O
U.S. O
and O
around O
the O
world N
will O
depend O
on O
local O
emissions N

the O
use H

Greek O
court N
rules N
worship N
of O
ancient O
Greek O
deities A
is O
legal O

Monday O
, O
March O
27 O
, O
2006 O

Greek O
court N
has O
ruled O
that O
worshippers H
of O
the O
ancient O
Greek O
religion N
may O
now O
formally O
associate O
and O
worship N
at O
archeological O
sites N
. O

Prior O
to O
the O
ruling N
, O
the O
religion N
was O
banned O
from O
conducting O
public O
worship N
at O
archeological O
sites N
by O
the O
Greek O
Ministry O
of O
Culture N
. O

Due O
to O
that O
, O
the O
religion N
was O
relatively O
secretive O
. O

The O
Greek O
Orthodox O
Church N
, O
a O
Christian H
denomination N
, O
is O
extremely O
critical O
of O
worshippers H
of O
the O
ancient O
deities A
. O

Today N
, O
about O
100,000 O
Greeks O
worship N
the O
ancient O
gods A
, O
such O
as O
Zeus H
, O
Hera O
, O
Poseidon O
, O
Aphrodite O
, O
and O
Athena H
. O

The O
Greek O
Orthodox O
Church N
estimates O
that O
number N
is O
closer O
to O
40,000 O
. O

Many O
neo O
- O
pagan O
religions N
, O
such O
as O
Wicca O
, O
use H
aspects N
of O
ancient O
Greek O
religions N
in O
their O
practice O
; O
Hellenic O
polytheism N
instead O
focuses O
exclusively O
on O
the O
ancient O
religions N
, O
as O
far O
as O
the O
fragmentary O
nature N
of O
the O
surviving O
source N
material O
allows O
. O

It O
is O
my H
special O
pleasure N
to O
address N
the O
fifty O
- O
ninth N
session N
of O
the O
General O
Assembly N
of O
the O
United O
Nations O
. O

This O
universal O
forum N
has O
enabled O
the O
peoples N
of O
the O
world N
to O
coordinate O
and O
harmonize O
their O
efforts N

preserving O
peace N
and O

in O
achieving O
prosperity N
and O
upholding O
the O

I H
would O
like O
to O
congratulate O
you H
, O
Mr. N
President H
, O
on O
being O
elected O
to O
preside O
over O
this O
august O
body N
and O
to O
express O
my H
confidence N
in O
your H
successful O
leadership N

I H
would O
also O
like O
, O
on O
behalf N
of O
Albania O
, O
to O
convey O
to O
the O
Secretary H
- O
General O
our H
highest O
appreciation N
for O
his O
leading N
contribution N
to O
the O
fulfilment N
of O
the O
historical O
mission N
of O
the O
United O

to O
the O
aspirations N

our H
peoples N
for O
a O
better O
world N
in O
which O
only O
peace N

democracy N
and O
economic O
prosperity N
reign O

This O
session N
of O
the O
General O
Assembly N
takes O
place N
in O
a O
milestone N
year N
for O
Europe O
. O

Only O
a O
few O
months N
ago O
, O
a O
historic O
event N
vitalized O
the O
dream O
of O
a O
more O
united O
and O
stronger O
Europe O
. O

Ten O
European O
countries N
, O
sharing N
a O
common O
aspiration N
for O
integration N
, O
were O
admitted O
into O
the O
European O
Union O
. O

The O
Albanian O
Government O
and O
society N
are O
engaged O
in O
an O
all O
- O
round O
European O
integration N
process N
, O
and O
they O
are O
carrying O
out H
necessary O
reforms N
with O
the O
necessary O
political O
will O
and O
drive O
. O

Albania O
is O
working O
to O
strengthen O
the O
democratic O
institutions N
and O
capacities N
of O
its O
central O
and O
local O
government N
with O
a O
view N
to O
bringing O
its O
legislation N
and O
conditions N
into O
line N
with O
European O
Union O
standards N
, O
progressively O
achieving O
concrete O
and O
measurable O
results N
, O
as O
previously O
defined O
. O

Determined O
to O
make O
our H
contribution N
to O
regional O
and O
global O
security N
, O
the O
Albanian O
Government O
considers O
the O
country's O
country N
's H
integration N
into O
NATO O
to O
be O
one N
of O
its O
major O
objectives N
. O

The O
NATO O
Istanbul O
Summit N
last O
June O
commended O
the O
progress N
made O
by O
my H
country N
in O
this O
regard N
and O
encouraged O
the O
deepening N
of O
reforms N
. O

It O
welcomed O
Albania's O
Albania O
's H
contribution N
to O
regional O
stability N
and O
cooperation N
and O
committed O
to O
assess O
our H
further O
progress N
at O
the O
next O
NATO O
summit N
, O
which O
would O
hopefully O
mark N
the O
start O
of O
negotiations N
for O
our H
full O
membership N
in O
the O
alliance N
. O

We H
believe O
that O
the O
commitments N
set O
up O
in O
the O
framework N
of O
the O
Adriatic O
Charter N
are O
also O
contributing O
to O
meet O
NATO O
standards N
, O
to O
the O
benefit N
of O
regional O
stability N
and O
security N
. O

We H
remain O
truly O
convinced O
that O
the O
respect N
and O
protection N
of O
human O
rights N
and O
freedoms N
are O
the O
main O
pillars N
of O
a O
pluralist O
democratic O
society N
. O

The O
Government O
of O
the O
Republic O
of O
Albania O
will O
continue O
to O
constantly O
demonstrate O
its O
commitment N
to O
a O
full O
implementation N
of O
the O
standards N
enshrined O
in O
the O
United O
Nations O
and O
Council N
of O
Europe O
conventions N
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
relevant O
documents N
of O
regional O
organizations N
, O
such O
as O
the O
Organization N
for O
Security N
and O
Cooperation O
in O
Europe O
, O
in O
which O
we H
are O
playing O
a O
very O
active O
role N
. O

We H
will O
continue O
to O
do O
so O
in O
the O
future N
as O
well O
. O

By O
adopting O
contemporary O
legislation N
and O
by O
becoming O
a O
party N
to O
other O
recently O
adopted O
international O
instruments N
on O
human O
rights N
, O
Albania O
has O
associated O
itself O
with O
countries N
that O
are O
enforcing O
a O
number N
of O
national O
strategies N
and O
programmes N
focusing O
on O
specific O
population N
groups N
, O
especially O
women H
, O
children H
, O
persons H
in O
need O
and O
minorities N
, O
among O
others O
. O

In O
recent O
years N
, O
the O
Albanian O
Government O
has O
started O
to O
periodically O
submit O
reports N
to O
the O
committees N
of O
the O
six O
main O
United O
Nations O
human O
rights N
treaties N
and O
is O
taking O
their O
recommendations N
into O
serious O
consideration N
. O

It O
is O
our H
belief N
that O
these O
international O
mechanisms N
play O
a O
significant O
and O
important O
role N
as O
guardians H
of O
the O
common O
human O
values N
we H
have O
together O
adopted O
. O

Albania O
, O
as O
one N
of O
the O
191 O
signatory H
countries N
of O
the O
Millennium O
Declaration O
, O
remains O
fully O
committed O
to O
implementation N
of O
the O
Millennium O
Development N
Goals O
, O
which O
have O
been O
properly O
reflected O
in O
a O
national O
strategy N
for O
social O
and O
economic O
development N
. O

The O
pattern N
of O
our H
sustained O
economic O
growth N
, O
which O
is O
at O
6 O
to O
7 O
per O
cent O
for O
the O
seventh O
consecutive O
year N
, O
is O
a O
good O
support N
base N
for O
the O
whole O
society N
to O
maintain O
higher O
standards N
of O
respect N
for O
human O
rights N
and O
to O
fight N
poverty N
and O
crime N
. O

I H
would O
like O
to O
take O
this O
opportunity N
to O
thank O
the O
United O
Nations O
specialized O
agencies N
for O
their O
valuable O
assistance N
in O
support N
of O
the O
implementation N
of O
these O
objectives N
nationwide O
and O
on O
a O
central O
and O
local O
level N
. O

The O
Albanian O
Government O
is O
pleased O
to O
note N
that O
an O
ever O
- O
healthier O
climate N
of O
confidence N
and O
relations N
of O
bilateral O
and O
multilateral O
cooperation N
are O
prevailing O
in O
the O
South O
- O
Eastern O
European O
region N
. O

The O
countries N
of O
the O
region N
are O
fully O
engaged O
in O
a O
process N
that O
will O
lead O
us H
clearly O
toward O
Euro O
- O
Atlantic O
integration N
and O
at O
the O
same O
time N
continually O
remove O
us H
from O
the O
extremist O
tendencies N
that O
caused O
a O
number N
of O
conflicts N
in O
the O
last O
decade N
. O

The O
regional O
policy N
of O
my H
Government O
is O
guided O
by O
the O
motto N
: O
' O
the O
more O
integrated O
in O
the O
region N
, O
the O
more O
integrated O
in O
Europe O
. O
' O

In O
implementing O
this O
policy N
, O
Albania O
is O
cooperating O
as O
never O
before O
with O
all O
the O
countries N
of O
the O
region N
by O
making O
borders N
less O
relevant O
, O
opening N
up O
to O
one N
regional O
market N
the O
implementation N
of O
free O
trade N
agreements N
and O
free O
movement N
corridors N
, O
and O
stimulating O
foreign O
direct O
investment N
. O

We H
are O
especially O
cooperating O
with O
the O
common O
fight N
against O
organized O
crime N
and O
all O
kinds N
of O
illegal O
trafficking O
. O

In O
the O
meantime N
, O
Albania O
is O
reinforcing O
its O
border N
management N
and O
control N
, O
guided O
by O
the O
European O
Union O
and O
NATO O
standards N
. O

My H
country N
will O
hold O
general O
parliamentary O
elections N
by O
the O
middle O
of O
next O
year N
. O

We H
are O
committed O
to O
doing O
all O
that O
is O
required O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
election N
process N
is O
fully O
compatible O
with O
international O
standards N
for O
free O
and O
fair O
elections N
. O

To H
that O
end N
, O
we H
are O
committed O
to O
continuing O
to O
work N
with O
relevant O
specialized O
institutions N
on O
elections N
by O
fully O
implementing O
especially O
OSCE O
/ O
Office O
for O

and O
standards N
are O
more O
important O
than O
the O
results N
of O
the O
elections N
. O

In O
the O
context N
of O
strengthening O
regional O
cooperation N
, O
my H
country N
is O
committed O
to O
a O
more O
enhanced O
partnership N
with O
all O
regional O
organizations N
and O
initiatives N
that O
serve O
the O
promotion N
of O
good O
neighbourly O
relations N
; O
the O
strengthening O
of O
regional O
peace N
, O
security N
and O
stability N
; O
ensuring O
political O
support N
for O
integration N
into O
Euro O

Atlantic O
structures N
, O
and O
attracting O
financing N
for O
national O
and O
regional O
projects N
in O
priority N
fields N
such O
as O
energy N
, O
transportation N
and O
telecommunications N
. O

On O
its O
path N
towards O
European O
integration N
, O
the O
South O
- O
East O
European O
region N
is O
still O
facing O
pending O
challenges N
, O
such O
as O
the O
future N
of O
Kosovo O
. O

Albania O
greatly O
appreciates O
the O
recent O
democratic O
and O
integration N
developments N
in O
Kosovo O
, O
thanks N
to O
the O
efforts N
of O
the O
respective O

and O
the O
partnership N
of O
its O

governing O
institutions N
with O

( O

. O

Allow O
me H
at O
this O
point N
to O
congratulate O
Mr. N
Soren O
Jessen O
- O
Petersen H
, O
Special O
Representative O
for O
Kosovo O
of O
the O
United O
Nations O
Secretary H
- O
General O
, O
in O
assuming O
this O
very O
important O
duty N
. O

When O
I H
tour N
around O
Taiwan O
, O
of O
course N
, O
I H
also O
find O
people N
taking O
action N
without O
even O
waiting O
for O
the O
ministries N
to O
take O
action N
. O

This O
is O
another O
of O
the O
g0v O
projects N
the O
environmental O
agency N
. O

If O
you H
change O
the O
O O
to O
a O
zero O
, O
you H
get O
into O
them O
, O
considering O
environmental O
agency N
. O

This O
is O
what O
people N
care N
about O
, O
the O
air N
quality N
, O
PM N
2.5 O
in O
Taiwan O
. O

More O
than O
2,000 O
people N
, O
actually O
, O
installed O
these O
in O
their O
balconies N
, O
in O
their O
schools N
and O
so O
on O
, O
to O
get O
a O
real O
- O
time N
sensor N
of O
their O
IoT O
devices N
but O
not O
just O
IoT O
. O

They O
also O
upload O
it O
to O
the O
public O
cloud N
, O
which O
then O
uploads O
it O
to O
a O
distributed O
ledger N
to O
make O
sure O
that O
nobody H
can O
modify O
those O
numbers N
after O
the O
fact N
. O

After O
that O
, O
we H
see O
this O
kind N
of O
innovation N
is O
very O
rare O
in O
Asia O
. O

When O
I H
talk O
to O
all O
the O
UN O
- O
related O
bodies N
, O
many O
other O
Asian O
countries N
tell O
me H
that O
they O
won't O
wo O
n't O
let O
this O
network N
grow O
to O
be O
2,000 O
nodes N
strong O
. O

If O
it's O
it O
's H
200 O
nodes N
strong O
, O
they O
will O
try O
to O
poach O
the O
leader H
to O
the O
government N
. O

If O
they O
refuse O
, O
then O
maybe O
, O
they O
get O
disappeared O
because O
they O
really O
challenge N
the O
legitimacy N
of O
the O
environmental O
agency N
. O

If O
the O
environmental O
agency N
group N
reports N
one N
number N
and O
your H
neighbors H
report N
another O
number N
, O
of O
course N
, O
you're H
you H
're O
going O
to O
trust N
the O
one N
that O
you H
participated O
yourself H
, O
even O
though O
it's O
it O
's H
a O
lower O
quality N
sensor N
. O

Because O
of O
that O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
very O
rare O
in O
Taiwan O
because O
we H
have O
an O
expanding O
civic O
space N
. O

The O
government N
takes O
the O
approach N
of O
, O
" O
we H
can't O
ca O
n't O
beat O
them O
, O
let's O
let O
's H
join O
them O
" O
. O

We H
manufacture O
low O
- O
cost O
, O
high O
- O
precision N
sensors N
for O
them O
, O
but O
we H
also O
see O
this O
as O
a O
map N
of O
digital O
gap N
in O
Taiwan O
, O
a O
digital O
divide O
. O

We H
set O
up O
points O
when O
the O
people N
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
resource N
to O
go O
to O
, O
indigenous O
places N
, O
places N
in O
the O
mountains N
. O

We H
also O
talk O
to O
the O
citizen H
scientists H
and O
they O
say O
they O
really O
want O
a O
point N
here O
to O
tell O
the O
air N
pollution N
from O
outside O
Taiwan O
or O
from O
inside O
Taiwan O
, O
domestically O
. O

There's O
There O
's H
no O
way N
the O
citizen H
scientists H
can O
install O
an O
AirBox O
there O
, O
even O
if O
they're O
they O
're O
very O
good O
at O
drones N
and O
so O
on O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
impossible O
to O
stay O
there O
forever O
. O

We H
can O
because O
we H
have O
wind N
turbines N
. O

That's O
That O
's H
electricity N
generators N
, O
power N
plants A
, O
over O
there O
. O

We H
can O
install O
those O
sensor N
networks N
as O
part N
of O
the O
complementary O
action N
. O

The O
beauty N
is O
this O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
all O
open O
hardware N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
all O
open O
source N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
on O
GitHub O
. O

You H
just O
download O
, O
put O
it O
onto O
Raspberry O
Pi O
, O
and O
then O
, O
you H
can O
do O
it O
yourself H
, O
as O
people N
have O
done O
over O
the O
world N
. O

If O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
change O
the O
source N
code N
, O
it O
uploads O
to O
the O
Taiwan O
network N
by O
default N
, O
so O
we H
kind N
of O
have O
the O
numbers N
of O
all O
the O
atmosphere N
and O
meteorological O
data N
. O

We H
have O
a O
website N
dedicated O
for O
this O
, O
the O
Civil O
IoT O
project N
at O
CI.taiwan.gov.tw O
, O
that O
is O
basically O
, O
collective O
intelligence N
, O
meteorological O
, O
air N
quality N
, O
earthquake N
, O
and O
disaster N
prevention N
, O
and O
things N
like O
that O
. O

We H
have O
single O
websites N
like O
this O
, O
CI O
for O
Collective O
Intelligence O
, O
AI O
for O
AI O
Taiwan O
, O
SI O
for O
Social O
Innovation N
, O
Smart O
Taiwan O
for O
the O
Smart O
Taiwan O
plan N
, O
and O
also O
, O
Bio O
Taiwan O
. O

The O
medical O
industry N
says O
, O
" O
You H
really O
should O
call O
it O
biomed.taiwan O
because O
bio O
and O
med N
are O
different O
things N
. O
" O

Biomed O
Taiwan O
goes O
to O
the O
same O
website N
as O
Bio O
Taiwan O
. O

In O
any O
case N
, O
what O
we're O
we H
're O
doing O
is O
now O
is O
breaking O
across O
ministry N
and O
municipality N
and O
national O
government N
because O
this O
says O
nothing N
about O
the O
level N
of O
the O
government N
or O
the O
departments N
. O

It O
is O
one N
, O
single O
message N
that O
is O
collaboratively O
curated O
by O
everybody O
. O

Through O
this O
, O
we H
solved O
not O
just O
our H
local O
social O
and O
environmental O
issues N
through O
economic O
approaches O
but O
using O
the O
SDGs O
as O
a O
map N
to O
unite O
the O
efforts N
together O
. O

Just O
by O
saying O
" O
Taiwan O
can O
help O
" O
, O
we H
mean O
specifically O
, O
17 O
, O
18 O
, O
which O
is O
the O
availability N
of O
reliable O
data N
that O
people N
from O
across O
sectors N
, O
across O
jurisdictions N
, O
can O
trust N
the O
data N
. O

Then O
, O
based O
on O
the O
data N
, O
we H
encourage O
cross-sectoral O
partnerships N
. O

Then O
, O
based O
on O
that O
, O
we H
make O
open O
innovations N
that O
we H
, O
then O
, O
export N
, O
not O
as O
colonizers H
but O
, O
really O
, O
co-creators O
. O

Just O
download O
it O
on O
GitHub O
and O
then O
, O
we H
devise O
something O
together O
in O
a O
way N
that O
has O
free O
access O
to O
science N
and O
technology N
. O

When O
I H
joined O
the O
cabinet N
two O
years N
ago O
, O
based O
on O
these O
ideas N
-- O
with O
a O
contract N
-- O
the O
administration N
asked O
me H
for O
a O
job N
description N
, O
because O
they've O
they O
've O
never O
seen O
anything O
like O
this O
before O
. O

Instead O
of O
a O
job N
description N
, O
I H
just O
wrote O
them O
a O
poem N
, O
a O
prayer N
, O
which O
I'm O
I H
'm O
going O
to O
read O
to O
you H
as O
a O
conclusion N
. O

To H
me H
, O
it O
means N
the O
shift N
from O
IT N
or O
ICT O
to O
digital O
, O
the O
shift N
from O
the O
sectors N
separately O
as O
attack N
or O
an O
innovation N
, O
or O
whatever O
, O
into O
the O
humanity N
as O
a O
whole O
. O

This O
is O
digital O
transformation N
for O
me H
. O

This O
is O
, O
literally O
, O
my H
job N
description N
. O

It O
goes O
like O
this O
. O

" O
When O
we H
see O
the O
Internet N
of O
Things N
, O
let's O
let O
's H
make O
it O
an O
Internet N
of O
Beings O
. O

When O
we H
see O
virtual O
reality N
, O
let's O
let O
's H
make O
it O
a O
shared O
reality N
. O

When O
we H
see O
machine N
learning O
, O
let's O
let O
's H
make O
it O
collaborative O
learning O
. O

When O
we H
see O
user H
experience N
, O
let's O
let O
's H
make O
it O
about O
human O
experience N
, O
and O
whenever O
we H
hear O
that O
a O
singularity N
is O
near O
, O
let's O
let O
's H
keep O
in O
mind N
and O
always O
remember O
that O
a O
plurality N
is O
here O
. O

Thank O
you H

much O

A H
Tryst N
With O
Destiny N

Indian O
Prime O
Minister H
Jawaharlal O
Nehru's O
Nehru H
's H
Inaugural O
Address N

14 O
August O
1947 O

Long O
years N
ago O
we H
made O
a O
tryst N
with O
destiny N
, O
and O
now O
the O
time N
comes O
when O
we H
shall O
redeem O
our H
pledge N
, O
not O
wholly O
or O
in O
full O
measure N
, O
but O
very O
substantially O
. O

At O
the O
stroke N
of O
the O
midnight N
hour N
, O
when O
the O
world N
sleeps O
, O
India O
will O
awake O
to O
life N
and O
freedom N
. O

A H
moment N
comes O
, O
which O
comes O
but O
rarely O
in O
history N
, O
when O
we H
step O
out H
from O
the O
old O
to O
the O
new O
, O
when O
an O
age N
ends O
, O
and O
when O
the O
soul N
of O
a O
nation N
, O
long O
suppressed O
, O
finds O
utterance N
. O

It O
is O
fitting O
that O
at O
this O
solemn O
moment N
, O
we H
take O
the O
pledge N
of O
dedication N
to O
the O
service N
of O
India O
and O
her O
people N
and O
to O
the O
still O
larger O
cause N
of O
humanity N
. O

At O
the O
dawn N
of O
history N
, O
India O
started O
on O
her O
unending O
quest N
, O
and O
trackless O
centuries N
are O
filled O
with O
her O
striving N
and O
grandeur N
of O
her O
success N
and O
failures N
. O

Through O
good O
and O
ill O
fortune N
alike O
, O
she O
has O
never O
lost O
sight N
of O
that O
quest N
, O
forgotten O
the O
ideals N
which O
gave O
her O
strength N
. O

We H
end N
today N
a O
period N
of O
misfortunes N
and O
India O
discovers O
herself O
again O
. O

The O
achievement N
we H
celebrate O
today N
is O
but O
a O
step O
, O
an O
opening N
of O
opportunity N
to O
the O
greater O
triumphs N
and O
achievements N
that O
await O
us H
. O

Are O
we H
brave O
enough O
and O
wise O
enough O
to O
grasp O
this O
opportunity N
and O
accept O
the O
challenge N
of O
the O
future N
? O

Freedom N
and O
power N
bring O
responsibility N
. O

The O
responsibility N
rests O
upon O
this O
Assembly N
, O
a O
sovereign O
body N
representing O
the O
sovereign O
people N
of O
India O
. O

Before O
the O
birth N
of O
freedom N
, O
we H
have O
endured O
all O
the O
pains N
of O
labour O
and O
our H
hearts N
are O
heavy O
with O
the O
memory N
of O
this O
sorrrow O
. O

Some O
of O
those O
pains N
continue O
even O
now O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
past N
is O
over O
and O
it O
is O
the O
future N
that O
beckons O
us H
now O
. O

That O
future N
is O
not O
one N
of O
ease N
or O
resting O
but O
of O
incessant O
striving N
so O
that O
we H
may O
fulfill O
the O
pledges N
we H
have O
so O
often O
taken O
and O
the O
one N
we H
shall O
take O
today N
. O

The O
service N
of O
India O
means N
, O
the O
service N
of O
the O
millions N
who O
suffer O
. O

It O
means N
the O
ending O
of O
poverty N
and O
ignorance N
and O
poverty N
and O
disease N
and O
inequality N
of O
opportunity N
. O

The O
ambition N
of O
the O
greatest O
men H
of O
our H
generation N
has O
been O
to O
wipe O
every O
tear N
from O
every O
eye N
. O

That O
may O
be O
beyond O
us H
, O
but O
as O
long O
as O
there O
are O
tears N
and O
suffering N
, O
so O
long O
our H
work N
will O
not O
be O
over O
. O

And O
so O
we H
have O
to O
labour O
and O
to O
work N
, O
and O
to O
work N
hard O
, O
to O
give O
reality N
to O
our H
dreams N
. O

Those O
dreams N
are O
for O
India O
, O
but O
they O
are O
also O
for O
the O
world N
, O
for O
all O
the O
nations N
and O
peoples N
are O
too O
closely O
knit O
together O
today N
for O
any O
one N
of O
them O
to O
imagine O
that O
it O
can O
live O
apart O
. O

Peace N
is O
said O
to O
be O
indivisible O
, O
so O
is O
freedom N
, O
so O
is O
prosperity N
now O
, O
and O
also O
is O
disaster N
in O
this O
one N
world N
that O
can O
no O
longer O
be O
split O
into O
isolated O
fragments N
. O

To H
the O
people N
of O
India O
, O
whose O
representatives H
we H
are O
, O
we H
make O
an O
appeal O
to O
join O
us H
with O
faith N
and O
confidence N
in O
this O
great O
adventure N
. O

This O
is O
no O
time N
for O
petty O
and O
destructive O
criticism N
, O
no O
time N
for O
illwill O
or O
blaming O
others O
. O

We H
have O
to O
build O
the O
noble O
mansion N
of O
free O
India O
where O
all O
her O
children H
may O
dwell O
. O

The O
appointed O
day N
has O
come O
- O
the O
day N
appointed O
by O
destiny N
- O
and O
India O
stands O
forth O
again O
, O
after O
long O
slumber N
and O
struggle O
, O
awake O
, O
vital O
, O
free O
and O
independent O
. O

The O
past N
clings O
on O
to O
us H
still O
in O
some O
measure N
and O
we H
have O
to O
do O
much O
before O
we H
redeem O
the O
pledges N
we H
have O
so O
often O
taken O
. O

Yet O
the O
turning O
- O
point N
is O
past N
, O
and O
history N
begins O
anew O
for O
us H
, O
the O
history N
which O
we H
shall O
live O
and O
act N
and O
others O
will O
write O
about O
. O

It O
is O
a O
fateful O
moment N
for O
us H
in O
India O
, O
for O
all O
Asia O
and O
for O
the O
world N
. O

A H
new O
star N
rises O
, O
the O
star N
of O
freedom N
in O
the O
East O
, O
a O
new O
hope O
comes O
into O
being O
, O
a O
vision N
long O
cherished O
materializes O
. O

May O
the O
star N
never O
set O
and O
that O
hope O
never O
be O
betrayed O
! O

We H
rejoice O
in O
that O
freedom N
, O
even O
though O
clouds N
surround O
us H
, O
and O
many O
of O
our H
people N
are O
sorrowstricken O
and O
difficult O
problems N
encompass O
us H
. O

But O
freedom N
brings O
responsibilities N
and O
burdens N
and O
we H
have O
to O
face N
them O
in O
the O
spirit N
of O
a O
free O
and O
disciplined O
people N
. O

On O
this O
day N
our H
first O
thoughts N
go O
to O
the O
architect H
of O
this O
freedom N
, O
the O
Father H
of O
our H
Nation O
, O
who O
, O
embodying O
the O
old O
spirit N
of O
India O
, O
held O
aloft O
the O
torch N
of O
freedom N
and O
lighted O
up O
the O
darkness N
that O
surrounded O
us H
. O

We H
have O
often O
been O
unworthy O
followers H
of O
his O
and O
have O
strayed O
from O
his O
message N
, O
but O
not O
only O
we H
but O
succeeding O
generations A
will O
remember O
this O
message N
and O
bear O
the O
imprint N
in O
their O
hearts N
of O
this O
great O
son H
of O
India O
, O
magnificent O
in O
his O
faith N
and O
strength N
and O
courage N
and O
humility N
. O

We H
shall O
never O
allow O
that O
torch N
of O
freedom N
to O
be O
blown O
out H
, O
however O
high O
the O
wind N
or O
stormy O
the O
tempest N
. O

Our H
next O
thoughts N
must O
be O
of O
the O
unknown O
volunteers H
and O
soldiers H
of O
freedom N
who O
, O
without O
praise N
or O
reward O
, O
have O
served O
India O
even O
unto O
death N
. O

We H
think O
also O
of O
our H
brothers H
and O
sisters H
who O
have O
been O
cut O
off O
from O
us H
by O
political O
boundaries N
and O
who O
unhappily O
can O
not O
share O
at O
present N
in O
the O
freedom N
that O
has O
come O
. O

They O
are O
of O
us H
and O
will O
remain O
of O
us H
whatever O
may O
happen O
, O
and O
we H
shall O
be O
sharers H
in O
their O
good O
[ O
or O
] O
ill O
fortune N
alike O
. O

The O
future N
beckons O
to O
us H
. O

Whither O
do O
we H
go O
and O
what O
shall O
be O
our H
endeavour N
? O

To H
bring O
freedom N
and O
opportunity N
to O
the O
common O
man H
, O
to O
the O
peasants H
and O
workers H
of O
India O
; O
to O
fight N
and O
end N
poverty N
and O
ignorance N
and O
disease N
; O
to O
build O
up O
a O
prosperous O
, O
democratic O
and O
progressive O
nation N
, O
and O
to O
create O
social O
, O
economic O
and O
political O
institutions N
which O
will O
ensure O
justice N
and O
fullness N
of O
life N
to O
every O
man H
and O
woman H
. O

We H
have O
hard O
work N
ahead O
. O

There O
is O
no O
resting O
for O
any O
one N
of O
us H
till O
we H
redeem O
our H
pledge N
in O
full O
, O
till O
we H
make O
all O
the O
people N
of O
India O
what O
destiny N
intended O
them O
to O
be O
. O

We H
are O
citizens H
of O
a O
great O
country N
on O
the O
verge N
of O
bold O
advance N
, O
and O
we H
have O
to O
live O
up O
to O
that O
high O
standard O
. O

All O
of O
us H
, O
to O
whatever O
religion N
we H
may O
belong O
, O
are O
equally O
the O
children H
of O
India O
with O
equal O
rights N
, O
privileges N
and O
obligations N
. O

We H
cannot O
can O
not O
encourage O
communalism N
or O
narrow O
- O
mindedness O
, O
for O
no O
nation N
can O
be O
great O
whose O
people N
are O
narrow O
in O
thought O
or O
in O
action N
. O

To H
the O
nations N
and O
peoples N
of O
the O
world N
we H
send O
greetings N
and O
pledge N
ourselves H
to O
cooperate O
with O
them O
in O
furthering O
peace N
, O
freedom N
and O
democracy N
. O

And O
to O
India O
, O
our H
much O
- O
loved O
motherland N
, O
the O
ancient O
, O
the O
eternal O
and O

Speaker O

remarks N
: O

Speaker O
Pelosi O
. O

Thank O
you H
, O
Mr. N
Chair O
. O

Thank O
you H
, O
Madam H
Speaker O
. O

I H
thank O
the O
gentleman H
from O
New H
York H
, O
the O
distinguished O
Chair O
of O
the O
Judiciary O
Committee N
, O
for O
yielding O
and O
for O
his O
leadership N
in O
bringing O
this O
important O
legislation N
to O
the O
Floor O
. O

And O
I H
commend O
Congresswoman O
Karen H
Bass H
, O
Madam H
Chair O
, O
for O
your H
great O
leadership N
in O
this O
important O
legislation N
. O

Madam H
Speaker O
, O
nearly O
one N
year N
ago O
, O
George H
Floyd H
gasped O
his O
last O
words N
, O
‘ O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
breathe O
, O
’ O
and O
ignited O
a O
nationwide O
reckoning N
on O
the O
racial O
injustice N
and O
police N
brutality N
in O
America O
. O

Americans O
from O
every O
corner N
of O
the O
country N
took O
to O
the O
streets N
to O
peacefully O
protest N
violence N
against O
Black H
Americans O
, O
waving O
Black H
Lives N
Matter N
flags N
, O
chanting O
the O
names N
of O
the O
murdered O
, O
repeating N
George H
Floyd's O
Floyd H
's H
dying O
words N
, O
‘ O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
breathe O
. O
’ O

They O
turned O
their O
agony N
into O
action N
, O
but O
tragically O
, O
despite O
these O
mass O
protests N
, O
the O
injustice N
, O
killings N
continued O
. O

Those O
protests N
were O
global O
. O

They O
were O
all O
over O
the O
world N
. O

Here O
, O
as O
Members H
of O
Congress N
and O
as O
Americans O
, O
we H
cannot O
can O
not O
accept O
this O
epidemic N
of O
injustice N
. O

We H
cannot O
can O
not O
stay O
silent O
when O
one N
– O
when O
our H
most O
vulnerable O
and O
historically O
marginalized O
communities N
, O
people N
of O
color N
, O
those O
living O
in O
poverty N
, O
Americans O
with O
disabilities N
are O
being O
targeted O
and O
sometimes O
killed O
. O

That O
is O
why O
, O
today N
, O
the O
House O
will O
again O
pass O
the O
George H
Floyd H
Justice H
in O
Policing O
Act O
and O
send O
it O
to O
the O
Senate O
and O
the O
President's O
President H
's H
desk N
so O
that O
it O
can O
finally O
become O
the O
law N
of O
the O
land O
. O

I H
salute O
Congresswoman O
Karen H
Bass H
who O
has O
been O
relentless O
, O
persistent O
and O
absolutely O
courageous O
in O
her O
leadership N
on O
this O
legislation N
. O

Thank O
you H
to O
the O
Congressional O
Black H
Caucus O
and O
its O
Chair O
, O
Joyce H
Beatty O
. O

And O
Judiciary O
Chair O
Jerry H
Nadler O
, O
thank O
you H
. O

The O
George H
Floyd H
Justice H
in O
Policing O
Act O
fundamentally O
transforms O
the O
culture N
of O
policing O
with O
strong O
, O
unprecedented O
reforms N
. O

This O
legislation N
will O
not O
erase O
centuries N
of O
systemic O
racism N
and O
excessive O
policing O
in O
America O
. O

It O
will O
not O
bring O
back O
George H
Floyd H
, O
Breonna O
Taylor H
– O
say O
her O
name N
, O
Breonna O
Taylor H
– O
Ahmaud O
Arbery O
, O
or O
the O
countless O
other O
men H
and O
women H
who O
died O
or O
were O
senselessly O
injured O
. O

But O
it O
will O
make O
a O
tremendous O
– O
take O
a O
tremendous O
step O
toward O
– O
or O
to O
stop N
the O
violence N
, O
stem O
the O
suffering N
and O
start O
to O
build O
a O
healthier O
, O
better O
relationship N
between O
law N
enforcement N
and O
communities N
that O
they O
respect N
. O

All O
of O
us H
here O
salute O
and O
are O
proudly O
, O
profoundly O
grateful O
to O
our H
law N
enforcement N
heroes N
. O

I H
grew O
up O
in O
a O
family H
, O
public O
service N
family H
. O

My H
father H
, O
my H
whole O
life N
at O
home N
, O
was O
Mayor O
of O
Baltimore O
. O

My H
brother H
was O
Mayor O
later O
, O
Thomas H
D’Alesandro O
, O
in O
Baltimore O
. O

And O
they O
had O
a O
motto N
about O
the O
police N
: O
‘ O
Be O
true O
to O
the O
men H
in O
blue O
. O
’ O

Of O
course N
this O
was O
a O
long O
time N
ago O
and O
they O
were O
all O
men H
. O

‘ O
Be O
true O
to O
the O
men H
in O
blue O
. O
’ O

So O
, O
I H
was O
I H
was O
raised O
with O
that O
respect N
, O
with O
the O
– O
prayerfully O
that O
these O
people N
, O
our H
men H
and O
women H
, O
now O
, O
men H
and O
women H
in O
uniform N
, O
whether O
they're O
they O
're O
police N
or O
fire N
, O
but O
addressing O
police N
here O
, O
our H
first O
responders H
left O
home N
when O
they O
left O
to O
go O
to O
work N
, O
not O
knowing O
– O
their O
families N
not O
knowing O
if O
they O
would O
return O
home N
because O
they O
were O
risking O
their O
lives O
to O
save O
lives O
and O
to O
protect O
all O
of O
us H
. O

So O
, O
it’s O
it O
’s H
with O
great O
, O
prayerful O
gratitude N
to O
most O
of O
the O
men H
and O
women H
in O
blue O
, O
that O
we H
sadly O
have O
to O
say O
that O
our H
appreciation N
for O
them O
cannot O
can O
not O
lapse O
into O
apathy N
or O
acceptance N
of O
actions N
that O
are O
fundamentally O
incompatible O
with O
the O
purpose N
of O
policing O
, O
the O
purpose N
of O
policing O
. O

Of O
course N
, O
we H
all O
– O
there's O
there O
's H
not O
anyone O
on O
our H
side N
of O
the O
aisle N
who O
has O
advocated O
any O
policy N
in O
this O
body N
to O
defund O
the O
police N
, O
contrary N
to O
misrepresentations N
that O
are O
coming O
forth O
. O

All O
of O
us H
here O
, O
again O
, O
salute O
and O
profoundly O
grateful O
for O
our H
law N
enforcement N
heroes N
. O

As O
the O
National O
Organization N
of O
Black H
Law H
Enforcement O
Executives O
writes O
, O
‘ O
The O
passage N
of O
this O
act N
is O
paramount O
in O
achieving O
the O
fundamental O
principle N
of O
a O
police N
force N
that O
protects O
and O
serves O
every O
citizen H
of O
their O
community N
with O
fairness N
, O
accountability N
and O
transparency N
in O
their O
actions N
. O
’ O

The O
Democratic O
Congress N
, O
together O
with O
the O
Biden O
- O
Harris H
Administration O
, O
is O
committed O
to O
not O
only O
ensuring O
that O
this O
legislation N
becomes O
law N
, O
but O
to O
take O
further O
action N
to O
end N
violence N
and O
advance N
justice N
in O
America O
. O

Let O
us H
ensure O
that O
the O
passage N
of O
the O
George H
Floyd H
Justice H
in O
Policing O
Act O
is O
the O
first O
of O
many O
steps N
in O
this O
direction N
. O

To H
the O
family H
of O
George H
Floyd H
that O
came O
here O
when O
the O
bill N
was O
being O
reviewed O
by O
your H
committee N
, O
Mr N
Chairman O
– O
you H
remember O
that O
day N
. O

We H
couldn't O
could O
n't O
be O
in O
your H
committee N
room N
because O
of O
COVID O
, O
but O
they O
came O
and O
they O
asked O
me H
that O
day N
, O
they O
said O
, O
‘ O
Madam H
Speaker O
, O
will O
you H
name N
this O
bill N
for O
our H
brother H
? O
’ O

Philonise O
, O
his O
brother H
, O
asked O
that O
question N
. O

I H
said O
, O
‘ O
Only O
if O
you H
think O
it O
is O
worthy O
of O
your H
brother H
. O
’ O

I H
think O
of O
George H
Floyd H
at O
least O
once O
a O
day N
– O
sometimes O
more O
. O

And O
you H
know O
why O
? O

Not O
just O
because O
of O
the O
sadness N
of O
it O
all O
, O
but O
I H
think O
of O
him O
because O
they O
tell O
us H
that O
in O
order O
to O
be O
safe O
from O
COVID O
, O
we H
must O
wash O
our H
hands N
for O
20 O
seconds N
. O

As O
I'm O
I H
'm O
washing O
my H
hands N
for O
20 O
seconds N
, O
after O
about O
eight O
or O
nine O
seconds N
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
thinking O

‘ O
This O
is O
taking O
forever O
. O

I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
do O
this O
for O
20 O
seconds N
. O

It O
takes O
too O
long O
. O
’ O

And O
then O
I H
think O
of O
George H
Floyd H
. O

Eight O
minutes N
and O
46 O
seconds N
. O

That's O
That O
's H
a O
long O
time N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
a O
long O
time N
, O
as O
Congresswoman O
Dean H
said O
, O
calling O
out H
for O
his O
mother H
, O
extending O
love O
to O
his O
family H
. O

OK O
. O

Let O
us H
ensure O
that O
George's O
George H
's H
brother H
, O
Philonise O
, O
when O
he O
said O
, O
‘ O
George's O
George H
's H
name N
means N
something O
, O
’ O
and O
that O
, O
as O
his O
daughter H
, O
Gianna O
, O
said O
, O
‘ O
Daddy H
changed O
the O
world N
’ O
with O
this O
legislation N
. O

Let O
us H
take O
an O
important O
step O
in O
changing O
the O
world N
for O
George's O
George H
's H
family H
, O
for O
all O
communities N
of O
color N
, O
for O
all O
Americans O
, O
for O
the O
whole O
world N
. O

With O
that O
, O
Madam H
Speaker O
, O
I H
urge N
a O
strong O
, O
bipartisan O
vote N
on O
the O
George H
Floyd H
Justice H
in O
Policing O
Act O
. O

I H
thank O
Karen H
Bass H
again O
, O
Madam H
Chair O
. O

Thank O
you H
so O
much O
, O
again O
. O

And O
I H
yield N
back O
the O
balance O
of O
my H
time N
. O

The O
Charter N
of O
the O
United O
Nations O
sends O
a O
clear N
message N
to O
us H
all O
: O
put O
people N
first O
. O

The O
first O
words N
of O
the O
Charter N
, O
“ O
We H
the O
peoples N
” O
, O
are O
a O
summons N
to O
place N
people N
at O
the O
centre N
of O
our H
work N
— O
every O
day N
, O
everywhere O
. O

People N
with O
anxieties N
and O
aspirations N
, O
people N
with O
heartbreaks N
and O
hopes N
and O
, O
above O
all O
, O
people N
with O
rights N
. O

Those O
rights N
are O
not O
a O
favour N
to O
be O
rewarded O
or O
withheld O
; O
they O
are O
an O
endowment N
for O
simply O
being O
human O
. O

Throughout O
the O
first O
half O
of O
my H
mandate N
, O
I H
have O
had O
the O
good O
fortune N
to O
meet O
people N
around O
the O
world N
, O
not O
in O
gilded O
meeting N
rooms N
but O
where O
they O
live O
, O
work N
and O
dream O
. O

And O
I H
have O
listened O
. O

I H
have O
heard O
families N
in O
the O
South O
Pacific O
who O
fear N
their O
lives O
being O
swept O
away O
by O
rising O
seas N
; O
young O
refugees H
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
yearning O
for O
a O
return O
to O
school N
and O
home N
; O
Ebola O
survivors H
in O
North H
Kivu O
struggling O
to O
rebuild O
their O
lives O
; O
women H
demanding O
equality N
and O
opportunity N
; O
people N
of O
all O
beliefs N
and O
traditions N
who O
suffer O
simply O
because O
of O
who O
they O
are O
; O
and O
so O
many O
others O
. O

We H
are O
living O
in O
a O
world N
of O
disquiet N
. O

A H
great O
many O
people N
fear N
getting O
trampled O
, O
thwarted O
, O
left O
behind O
. O

Machines N
take O
their O
jobs N
, O
traffickers H
take O
their O
dignity N
, O
demagogues H
take O
their O
rights N
, O
warlords H
take O
their O
lives O
, O
fossil N
fuels N
take O
their O
futures N
. O

And O
yet O
people N
believe O
in O
the O
spirit N
and O
ideas N
that O
bring O
us H
to O
this O
Hall H
. O

They O
believe O
in O
the O
United O
Nations O
. O

But O
do O
they O
believe O
in O
us H
? O

Do O
they O
believe O
that O
, O
as O
leaders H
, O
we H
will O
put O
people N
first O
? O

We H
the O
leaders H
must O
deliver O
for O
we H
the O
peoples N
. O

People N
have O
the O
right O
to O
live O
in O
peace N
. O

One O
year N
ago O
in O
this O
Hall H
, O
I H
spoke O
of O
winds N
of O
hope O
despite O
the O
chaos O
and O
confusion N
of O
our H
world N
( O
see O
A/73/PV.6 O
) O
. O

Since O
then O
, O
some O
of O
those O
currents N
have O
continued O
to O
move O
in O
promising O
directions N
. O

Against O
the O
expectations N
of O
many O
, O
elections N
unfolded O
peacefully O
in O
Madagascar O
, O
the O
Maldives O
and O
the O
Democratic O
Republic O
of O
the O
Congo O
, O
to O
name N
just O
a O
few O
places N
. O

Greece O
and O
the O
Republic O
of O
North H
Macedonia O
resolved O
their O
decades N
- O
long O
name N
dispute N
. O

Political O
dialogue N
in O
the O
Sudan O
and O
the O
peace N
process N
in O
the O
Central O
African O
Republic O
have O
brought O
renewed O
hope O
. O

A H
long O
- O
sought O
step O
forward O
has O
just O
been O
taken O
on O
the O
political O
path N
out H
of O
the O
tragedy N
in O
Syria O
, O
in O
line N
with O
Security N
Council N
resolution N
2254 O
( O
2015 O
) O
. O

As O
I H
announced O
yesterday N
, O
an O
agreement N
has O
been O
reached O
with O
all O
parties N
for O
a O
credible O
, O
balanced O
and O
inclusive O
Syrian O
- O
owned O
and O
Syrian O
- O
led O
constitutional O
committee N
. O

My H
Special O
Envoy O
just O
left O
Damascus O
after O
finalizing O
the O
last O
details N
with O
the O
Government O
and O
the O
opposition N
. O

The O
United O
Nations O
looks O
forward O
to O
convening O
the O
committee N
in O
Geneva O
in O
the O
coming O
weeks N
. O

However O
, O
across O
the O
global O
landscape N
, O
we H
see O
conflicts N
persisting O
, O
terrorism N
spreading O
and O
the O
risk N
of O
a O
new O
arms N
race N
growing O
. O

Outside O
interferences N
, O
often O
in O
violation N
of O
Security N
Council N
resolutions N
, O
make O
peace N
processes N
more O
difficult O
. O

Many O
situations N
remain O
unresolved O
, O
from O
Yemen O
and O
Libya O
to O
Afghanistan O
and O
beyond O
. O

A H
succession N
of O
unilateral O
actions N
threatens O
to O
thwart O
a O
two O
- O
State N
solution N
between O
Israel O
and O
Palestine O
. O

In O
Venezuela O
, O
4 O
million O
people N
have O
fled O
the O
country N
— O
one N
of O
the O
largest O
displacements N
in O
the O
world N
. O

Tensions N
are O
heightened O
in O
South O
Asia O
, O
where O
differences N
need O
to O
be O
addressed O
through O
dialogue N
. O

Above O
all O
, O
we H
are O
facing O
the O
alarming O
possibility N
of O
armed O
conflict N
in O
the O
Gulf O
, O
the O
consequences N
of O
which O
the O
world N
can O
not O
afford O
. O

The O
recent O
attack N
on O
Saudi O
Arabia’s O
Arabia O
’s H
oil N
facilities N
was O
completely O
unacceptable O
. O

In O
a O
context N
where O
a O
minor O
miscalculation N
can O
lead O
to O
a O
major O
confrontation N
, O
we H
must O
do O
everything O
possible O
to O
push O
for O
reason N
and O
restraint N
. O

I H
hope O
for O
a O
future N
in O
which O
all O
the O
countries N
of O
the O
region N
can O
live O
in O
a O
state N
of O
mutual O
respect N
and O
cooperation N
, O
without O
interference N
in O
each O
other’s O
other O
’s H
affairs N
. O

I H
hope O
equally O
that O
it O
will O
still O
be O
possible O
to O
preserve O
the O
progress N
on O
nuclear O
non-proliferation N
represented O
by O
the O
Joint O
Comprehensive O
Plan N
of O
Action N
. O

From O
the O
first O
day N
, O
I H
have O
emphasized O
prevention N
, O
mediation N
and O
a O
surge N
in O
diplomacy N
for O
peace N
in O
order O
to O
address N
the O
crises N
that O
we H
face N
. O

Consider O
the O
lives O
that O
we H
can O
save O
by O
strengthening O
our H
investments N
to O
sustain O
peace N
around O
the O
world N
. O

Across O
some O
of O
the O
most O
troubled O
corners N
of O
the O
world N
, O
some O
100,000 O
United O
Nations O
peacekeepers H
protect O
civilians H
and O
promote O
peace N
. O

Through O
the O
Action N
for O
Peacekeeping O
initiative N
, O
we H
are O
strengthening O
our H
effectiveness N
and O
efficiency N
and O
we H
are O
renewing O
partnerships N
with O
troop N
- O
and O
police N
- O
contributing O
countries N
, O
host H
countries N
and O
regional O
organizations N
, O
such O
as O
the O
African O
Union O
and O
the O
European O
Union O
. O

I H
am O
also O
proud O
of O
the O
work N
of O
our H
humanitarian O
workers H
, O
easing O
suffering N
around O
the O
world N
. O

Fully O
half O
of O
all O
international O
relief N
aid N
is O
channelled O
through O
the O
United O
Nations O
, O
ensuring O
that O
millions N
receive O
protection N
, O
food N
, O
medicine N
, O
shelter N
, O
water N
and O
other O
life N
- O
saving O
forms N
of O
assistance N
. O

This O
year N
alone O
, O
in O
brutal O
attacks N
and O
other O
circumstances N
, O
we H
have O
lost O
at O
least O
80 O
peacekeepers H
, O
humanitarian O
workers H
and O
others O
, O
all O
of O
whom O
gave O
their O
lives O
serving O
the O
United O
Nations O
and O
trying O
to O
better O
the O
lives O
of O
others O
. O

I H
honour N
their O
service N
and O
their O
sacrifice N
. O

We H
have O
bolstered O
our H
counter-terrorism O
architecture N
and O
defined O
new O
strategies N
to O
tackle O
violent O
extremism N
and O
to O
address N
root N
causes N
, O
while O
respecting O
human O
rights N
. O

I H
have O
put O
forward O
a O
new O
disarmament N
agenda N
to O
advance N
global O
peace N
. O

In O
the O
near O
term N
, O
the O
New H
START O
Treaty N
must O
be O
extended O
. O

We H
must O
work N
to O
address N
the O
heightened O
threat N
posed O
by O
ballistic O
missiles N
and O
ensure O
a O
successful O
2020 O
Review N
Conference N
of O
the O
Parties O
to O
the O
Treaty N
on O
the O
Non-Proliferation O
of O
Nuclear O
Weapons N
. O

The O
situation N
of O
the O
Korean O
peninsula N
remains O
uncertain O
. O

I H
fully O
support N
the O
efforts N
towards O
a O
new O
summit N
between O
the O
President H
of O
the O
United O
States O
and O
the O
leader H
of O
the O
Democratic O
People’s O
People N
’s H
Republic O
of O
Korea O
. O

At O
this O
time N
of O
transition N
and O
dysfunction N
in O
global O
power N
relations N
, O
there O
is O
a O
new O
risk N
looming O
on O
the O
horizon N
that O
may O
not O
yet O
be O
large O
but O
it O
is O
real O
. O

I H
fear N
the O
possibility N
of O
a O
great O
fracture N
— O
the O
world N
splitting O
in O
two O
, O
with O
the O
two O
largest O
economies N
on O
Earth O
creating O
two O
separate O
and O
competing O
worlds N
, O
each O
with O
their O
own O
dominant O
currency N
, O
trade N
and O
financial O
rules N
, O
their O
own O
Internet N
and O
artificial O
intelligence N
capacities N
and O
their O
own O
zero O
- O
sum N
geopolitical O
and O
military O
strategies N
. O

We H
must O
do O
everything O
possible O
to O
avert O
the O
great O
fracture N
and O
maintain O
a O
universal O
system N
— O
a O
universal O
economy N
with O
universal O
respect N
for O
international O
law N
, O
a O
multipolar O
world N
with O
strong O
multilateral O
institutions N

MAIDEN H
SPEECH N

Mr. N
President H
, O
I H
need O
to O
catch O
my H
breath N
, O
so O
much O
has O
happened O
. O

A H
few O
hours N
ago O
, O
on O
the O
West O
Front O
of O
this O
citadel N
of O
democracy N
, O
Joe H
Biden O
and O
KAMALA O
HARRIS O
were O
administered O
the O
oaths N
of O
Office O
to O
the O
Presidency N
and O
Vice N
Presidency N
of O
the O
United O
States O
. O

We H
have O
turned O
the O
page N
to O
a O
new O
chapter N
in O
the O
history N
of O
our H
democracy N
, O
and O
I H
am O
full O
of O
hope O
. O

I H
would O
challenge N
anyone O
not O
to O
feel O
hopeful O
today N
after O
listening O
to O
Amanda H
Gorman O
, O
the O
amazing O
22 O
– O
year N
- O
old O
poet H
, O
wise O
far O
beyond O
her O
years N
, O
who O
told O
us H
that O
: O

Somehow O
we’ve O
we H
’ve O
weathered O
and O
witnessed O
a O
nation N
that O
isn’t O
is O
n’t O
broken O
but O
simply O
unfinished O

The O
hope O
she O
spoke O
about O
— O
the O
strong O
and O
happy O
hope O
— O
the O
hope O
we H
feel O
today N
, O
is O
a O
hope O
, O
of O
course N
, O
that O
is O
tempered O
by O
reality N
. O

This O
was O
an O
inauguration N
unlike O
most O
others O
. O

The O
crowds N
that O
customarily O
line N
the O
National O
Mall O
were O
absent O
, O
a O
reminder N
that O
our H
Nation O
is O
still O
in O
the O
throes N
of O
a O
deadly O
pandemic N
. O

The O
presence N
of O
thousands N
of O
National O
Guardsmen O
, O
police N
, O
and O
Secret N
Service O
was O
a O
reminder N
that O
2 O
weeks N
ago O
, O
in O
this O
very O
room N
and O
on O
those O
very O
steps N
where O
President H
Biden O
took O
the O
oath N
, O
a O
mob N
of O
violent O
criminals H
tried O
to O
dismantle O
our H
democracy N
— O
our H
sacred O
democracy N
— O
brick N
by O
brick N
and O
would O
try O
again O
if O
they O
could O
. O

But O
, O
as O
President H
Biden O
said O
a O
few O
hours N
ago O
, O
today N
, O
democracy N
has O
prevailed O
, O
the O
will O
of O
the O
people N
was O
heeded O
, O
and O
the O
peaceful O
transfer H
of O
power N
fulfilled O
. O

It O
takes O
a O
lot N
more O
than O
a O
band N
of O
hooligans H
to O
bring O
our H
grand O
democracy N
down O
. O

Let O
it O
be O
a O
message N
to O
our H
friends H
and O
adversaries H
around O
the O
world N
that O
our H
democracy N
, O
though O
it O
has O
been O
tried O
and O
been O
tested O
, O
shall O
long O
endure O
. O

And O
let O
it O
be O
a O
message N
to O
those O
terrorists H
who O
desecrated O
this O
temple N
of O
democracy N
that O
they O
will O
never O
prevail O
. O

Joe H
Biden O
is O
now O
the O
46th O
President H
of O
the O
United O
States O
. O

KAMALA O
HARRIS O
is O
now O
the O
49th O
Vice N
President H
of O
the O
United O
States O
. O

But O
, O
of O
course N
, O
in O
more O
ways N
than O
one N
, O
she O
is O
not O
the O
49th O
but O
the O
first O
— O
the O
first O
African O
- O
American O
woman H
, O
the O
first O
Asian O
- O
American O
woman H
, O
and O
the O
first O
woman H
, O
period N
, O
to O
hold O
the O
Office O
of O
Vice N
Presidency N
in O
our H
Nation’s O
Nation O
’s H
history N
. O

Today N
, O
the O
threat N
to O
our H
democracy N
from O
the O
Presidency N
itself O
has O
ended O
, O
but O
the O
challenges N
we H
face N
as O
a O
nation N
remain O
. O

In O
the O
wake O
of O
violence N
and O
division N
, O
hatred N
and O
mistruth O
, O
in O
the O
shadow N
of O
disease N
and O
economic O
hardship N
, O
a O
warming O
planet N
and O
unequal O
society N
, O
we H
begin O
the O
work N
of O
the O
117th O
Congress N
. O

In O
his O
inaugural O
address N
, O
President H
Biden O
spoke O
to O
this O
moment N
— O
a O
moment N
of O
great O
challenge N
— O
and O
told O
us H
two O
simple O
truths N
: O
One O
, O
that O
our H
responsibilities N
are O
numerous O
, O
and O
, O
two O
, O
it O
will O
take O
unity N
— O
unity N
of O
spirit N
, O
unity N
of O
purpose N
— O
to O
fulfill O
them O
. O

President H
Biden O
, O
we H
heard O
you H
loud O
and O
clear N
. O

We H
have O
a O
lengthy O
agenda N
, O
and O
we H
need O
to O
get O
it O
done O
together O
. O

President H
Biden O
pointed O
the O
way N
to O
our H
Nation’s O
Nation O
’s H
recovery N
and O
renewal N
. O

He O
reminded O
us H
of O
who O
we H
are O
and O
where O
we H
need O
to O
go O
, O
but O
we H
must O
now O
turn O
the O
spirit N
of O
his O
words N
into O
action N
. O

The O
Senate O
must O
immediately O
set O
to O
work N
on O
the O
mission N
President H
Biden O
described O
— O
restoring O
the O
greatness N
and O
goodness N
of O
America O
. O

This O
will O
be O
an O
exceptionally O
busy O
and O
consequential O
period N
for O
the O
U.S. O
Senate O
. O

There O
is O
much O
to O
do O
, O
and O
we H
are O
ready O
to O
get O
to O
work N
. O

Now O
, O
not O
to O
upstage O
our H
new O
President H
and O
Vice N
President H
, O
but O
theirs O
has O
not O
been O
the O
only O
swearing N
in O
today N
. O

A H
few O
moments N
ago O
, O
the O
Senate O
welcomed O
three O
new O
Members H
to O
this O
Chamber O
. O

I H
can O
now O
happily O
and O
proudly O
call O
them O
Senator O
PADILLA O
, O
Senator O
OSSOFF O
, O
and O
Senator O
WARNOCK O
. O

They O
join O
Senators O
KELLY O
, O
HICKENLOOPER O
, O
and O
Luján O
as O
part N
of O
a O
six O
- O
Member N
class N
of O
Democratic O
Senators O
and O
a O
new O
Democratic O
Senate O
majority N
. O

I H
mention N
the O
historic O
nature N
of O
Vice N
President H
HARRIS’ O
HARRIS O
’ O
ascendance N
, O
but O
let’s O
let O
’s H
not O
forget O
that O
her O
successor N
, O
ALEX O
PADILLA O
, O
is O
the O
first O
Latino O
Senator O
to O
represent O
California O
; O
that O
RAFAEL O
WARNOCK O
, O
born O
while O
Georgia O
was O
represented O
in O
this O
Chamber O
by O
two O
staunch O
segregationists H
, O
is O
now O
the O
first O
African O
- O
American O
Senator O
Georgia O
has O
ever O
elected O
; O
and O
that O
JOHN O
OSSOFF O
is O
the O
first O
Jewish O
Senator O
from O
his O
State N
, O
sworn O
in O
today N
on O
a O
book O
of O
Hebrew O
Scripture O
once O
owned O
by O
the O
rabbi H
, O
who O
, O
decades N
ago O
, O
formed O
a O
bond N
between O
the O
Jewish O
and O
African O
- O
American O
communities N
of O
Georgia O
. O

As O
President H
Biden O
said O
in O
his O
inaugural O
address N
, O
“ O
don’t O
do O
n’t O
tell O
me H
things N
can’t O
ca O
n’t O
change O
. O
” O

With O
the O
swearing N
in O
of O
these O
three O
Senators O
, O
the O
Senate O
will O
turn O
to O
Democratic O
control N
, O
for O
which O
I H
deeply O
thank O
my H
colleagues H
. O

We H
will O
return O
to O
Democratic O
control N
under O
the O
first O
New H
York H
- O
born O
majority N
leader H
in O
American O
history N
— O
a O
kid H
from O
Brooklyn O
, O
the O
son H
of O
an O
exterminator H
and O
a O
housewife H
, O
and O
a O
descendant H
of O
victims H
of O
the O
Holocaust O
. O

That O
I H
should O
be O
the O
leader H
of O
this O
new O
Senate O
majority N
is O
an O
awesome O
responsibility N
— O
awesome O
in O
the O
Biblical O
sense N
, O
as O
the O
angels A
that O
tremble O
in O
awe N
before O
God H
. O

Today N
, O
I H
feel O
the O
full O
weight N
of O
that O
responsibility N
, O
a O
sense N
of O
reverence N
and O
of O
awe N
at O
the O
trust N
placed O
in O
me H
. O

I H
intend O
to O
honor N
that O
trust N
with O
all O
of O
my H
energy N
and O
with O
joy N
. O

And O
as O
the O
majority N
changes N
in O
the O
Senate O
, O
the O
Senate O
will O
do O
business N
differently O
. O

The O
Senate O
will O
address N
the O
challenges N
our H
country N
faces N
head N
on O
and O
without O
delay N
, O
not O
with O
timid O
solutions N
but O
with O
boldness N
and O
with O
courage N
. O

The O
Senate O
will O
tackle O
the O
perils N
of O
the O
moment N
, O
a O
once O

Announcing O
Decision O
To H
Resign O
the O
Office O

President H

the O
United O
States O

August O
08 O
, O
1974 O

Good O
evening N
: O

This O
is O
the O
37th O
time N
I H
have O
spoken O
to O
you H
from O
this O
office N
, O
where O
so O
many O
decisions N
have O
been O
made O
that O
shaped O
the O
history N
of O
this O
Nation O
. O

Each O
time N
I H
have O
done O
so O
to O
discuss O
with O
you H
some O
matter N
that O
I H
believe O
affected O
the O
national O
interest N
. O

In O
all O
the O
decisions N
I H
have O
made O
in O
my H
public O
life N
, O
I H
have O
always O
tried O
to O
do O
what O
was O
best O
for O
the O
Nation O
. O

Throughout O
the O
long O
and O
difficult O
period N
of O
Watergate O
, O
I H
have O
felt N
it O
was O
my H
duty N
to O
persevere O
, O
to O
make O
every O
possible O
effort N
to O
complete O
the O
term N
of O
office N
to O
which O
you H
elected O
me H
. O

In O
the O
past N
few O
days N
, O
however O
, O
it O
has O
become O
evident O
to O
me H
that O
I H
no O
longer O
have O
a O
strong O
enough O
political O
base N
in O
the O
Congress N
to O
justify O
continuing O
that O
effort N
. O

As O
long O
as O
there O
was O
such O
a O
base N
, O
I H
felt N
strongly O
that O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
see O
the O
constitutional O
process N
through O
to O
its O
conclusion N
, O
that O
to O
do O
otherwise O
would O
be O
unfaithful O
to O
the O
spirit N
of O
that O
deliberately O
difficult O
process N
and O
a O
dangerously O
destabilizing O
precedent N
for O
the O
future N
. O

But O
with O
the O
disappearance N
of O
that O
base N
, O
I H
now O
believe O
that O
the O
constitutional O
purpose N
has O
been O
served O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
longer O
a O
need O
for O
the O
process N
to O
be O
prolonged O
. O

I H
would O
have O
preferred O
to O
carry O
through O
to O
the O
finish O
, O
whatever O
the O
personal O
agony N
it O
would O
have O
involved O
, O
and O
my H
family H
unanimously O
urged O
me H
to O
do O
so O
. O

But O
the O
interests N
of O
the O
Nation O
must O
always O
come O
before O
any O
personal O
considerations N
. O

From O
the O
discussions N
I H
have O
had O
with O
Congressional O
and O
other O
leaders H
, O
I H
have O
concluded O
that O
because O
of O
the O
Watergate O
matter N
, O
I H
might O
not O
have O
the O
support N
of O
the O
Congress N
that O
I H
would O
consider O
necessary O
to O
back O
the O
very O
difficult O
decisions N
and O
carry O
out H
the O
duties N
of O
this O
office N
in O
the O
way N
the O
interests N
of O
the O
Nation O
will O
require O
. O

I H
have O
never O
been O
a O
quitter H
. O

To H
leave O
office N
before O
my H
term N
is O
completed O
is O
abhorrent O
to O
every O
instinct N
in O
my H
body N
. O

But O
as O
President H
, O
I H
must O
put O
the O
interests N
of O
America O
first O
. O

America O
needs N
a O
full O
- O
time N
President H
and O
a O
full O
- O
time N
Congress N
, O
particularly O
at O
this O
time N
with O
problems N
we H
face N
at O
home N
and O
abroad O
. O

To H
continue O
to O
fight N
through O
the O
months N
ahead O
for O
my H
personal O
vindication N
would O
almost O
totally O
absorb O
the O
time N
and O
attention N
of O
both O
the O
President H
and O
the O
Congress N
in O
a O
period N
when O
our H
entire O
focus O
should O
be O
on O
the O
great O
issues N
of O
peace N
abroad O
and O
prosperity N
without O
inflation N
at O
home N
. O

Therefore O
, O
I H
shall O
resign O
the O
Presidency N
effective O
at O
noon N
tomorrow N
. O

Vice N
President H
Ford H
will O
be O
sworn O
in O
as O
President H
at O
that O
hour N
in O
this O
office N
. O

As O
I H
recall O
the O
high O
hopes N
for O
America O
with O
which O
we H
began O
this O
second N
term N
, O
I H
feel O
a O
great O
sadness N
that O
I H
will O
not O
be O
here O
in O
this O
office N
working O
on O
your H
behalf N
to O
achieve O
those O
hopes N
in O
the O
next O
2 O
1/2 O
years N
. O

But O
in O
turning O
over O
direction N
of O
the O
Government O
to O
Vice N
President H
Ford H
, O
I H
know O
, O
as O
I H
told O
the O
Nation O
when O
I H
nominated O
him O
for O
that O
office N
10 O
months N
ago O
, O
that O
the O
leadership N
of O
America O
will O
be O
in O
good O
hands N
. O

In O
passing O
this O
office N
to O
the O
Vice N
President H
, O
I H
also O
do O
so O
with O
the O
profound O
sense N
of O
the O
weight N
of O
responsibility N
that O
will O
fall N
on O
his O
shoulders N
tomorrow N
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
of O
the O
understanding N
, O
the O
patience N
, O
the O
cooperation N
he O
will O
need O
from O
all O
Americans O
. O

As O
he O
assumes O
that O
responsibility N
, O
he O
will O
deserve O
the O
help O
and O
the O
support N
of O
all O
of O
us H
. O

As O
we H
look O
to O
the O
future N
, O
the O
first O
essential O
is O
to O
begin O
healing O
the O
wounds N
of O
this O
Nation O
, O
to O
put O
the O
bitterness N
and O
divisions N
of O
the O
recent O
past N
behind O
us H
and O
to O
rediscover O
those O
shared O
ideals N
that O
lie O
at O
the O
heart N
of O
our H
strength N
and O
unity N
as O
a O
great O
and O
as O
a O
free O
people N
. O

By O
taking O
this O
action N
, O
I H
hope O
that O
I H
will O
have O
hastened O
the O
start O
of O
that O
process N
of O
healing O
which O
is O
so O
desperately O
needed O
in O
America O
. O

I H
regret O
deeply O
any O
injuries N
that O
may O
have O
been O
done O
in O
the O
course N
of O
the O
events N
that O
led O
to O
this O
decision N
. O

I H
would O
say O
only O
that O
if O
some O
of O
my H
judgments N
were O
wrong O
-- O
and O
some O
were O
wrong O
-- O
they O
were O
made O
in O
what O
I H
believed O
at O
the O
time N
to O
be O
the O
best O
interest N
of O
the O
Nation O
. O

To H
those O
who O
have O
stood O
with O
me H
during O
these O
past N
difficult O
months N
-- O
to O
my H
family H
, O
my H
friends H
, O
to O
many O
others O
who O
joined O
in O
supporting O
my H
cause N
because O
they O
believed O
it O
was O
right O
-- O
I H
will O
be O
eternally O
grateful O
for O
your H
support N
. O

And O
to O
those O
who O
have O
not O
felt N
able O
to O
give O
me H
your H
support N
, O
let O
me H
say O
I H
leave O
with O
no O
bitterness N
toward O
those O
who O
have O
opposed O
me H
, O
because O
all O
of O
us H
, O
in O
the O
final O
analysis N
, O
have O
been O
concerned O
with O
the O
good O
of O
the O
country N
, O
however O
our H
judgments N
might O
differ O
. O

So O
, O
let O
us H
all O
now O
join O
together O
in O
affirming O
that O
common O
commitment N
and O
in O
helping O
our H
new O
President H
succeed O
for O
the O
benefit N
of O
all O
Americans O
. O

I H
shall O
leave O
this O
office N
with O
regret O
at O
not O
completing O
my H
term N
, O
but O
with O
gratitude N
for O
the O
privilege N
of O
serving O
as O
your H
President H
for O
the O
past N
5 O
1/2 O
years N
. O

These O
years N
have O
been O
a O
momentous O
time N
in O
the O
history N
of O
our H
Nation O
and O
the O
world N
. O

They O
have O
been O
a O
time N
of O
achievement N
in O
which O
we H
can O
all O
be O
proud O
, O
achievements N
that O
represent O
the O
shared O
efforts N
of O
the O
Administration O
, O
the O
Congress N
, O
and O
the O
people N
. O

But O
the O
challenges N
ahead O
are O
equally O
great O
, O
and O
they O
, O
too O
, O
will O
require O
the O
support N
and O
the O
efforts N
of O
the O
Congress N
and O
the O
people N
working O
in O
cooperation N
with O
the O
new O
Administration O
. O

We H
have O
ended O
America's O
America O
's H
longest O
war N
, O
but O
in O
the O
work N
of O
securing O
a O
lasting O
peace N
in O
the O
world N
, O
the O
goals N
ahead O
are O
even O
more O
far O
- O
reaching O
and O
more O
difficult O
. O

We H
must O
complete O
a O
structure N
of O
peace N
so O
that O
it O
will O
be O
said O
of O
this O
generation N
, O
our H
generation N
of O
Americans O
, O
by O
the O
people N
of O
all O
nations N
, O
not O
only O
that O
we H
ended O
one N
war N
but O
that O
we H
prevented O
future N
wars N
. O

We H
have O
unlocked O
the O
doors N
that O
for O
a O
quarter N
of O
a O
century N
stood O
between O
the O
United O
States O
and O
the O
People's O
People N
's H
Republic O
of O
China O
. O

We H
must O
now O
ensure O
that O
the O
one N
quarter N
of O
the O
world's O
world N
's H
people N
who O
live O
in O
the O
People's O
People N
's H
Republic O
of O
China O
will O
be O
and O
remain O
not O
our H
enemies H
, O
but O
our H
friends H
. O

I H
am O
proud O
to O
come O
here O
to O
Philadelphia O
and O
join O
my H
fellow H
Democrats O
. O

In O
1960 O
, O
the O
Democrats O
of O
this O
city N
produced O
a O
margin N
in O
the O
presidential O
race N
that O
was O
in O
this O
city N
three O
times N
as O
large O
as O
it O
was O
in O
the O
whole O
United O
States O
. O

So O
I H
am O
proud O
to O
be O
back O
here O
again O
, O
and O
I H
am O
very O
happy O
to O
be O
introduced O
by O
your H
distinguished O
chairman H
, O
Bill H
Green H
. O

When O
he O
became O
chairman H
of O
this O
city N
committee N
, O
there O
were O
300,000 O
more O
Republicans O
registered O
in O
the O
city N
of O
Philadelphia O
than O
Democrats O
, O
and O
it O
is O
a O
source N
of O
satisfaction N
to O
me H
that O
tonight N
there O
are O
260,000 O
more O
Democrats O
registered O
. O

I H
can O
understand O
why O
some O
Republicans O
may O
not O
like O
it O
, O
but O
, O
as O
a O
Democrat O
, O
as O
one N
who O
believes O
in O
the O
Democratic O
Party O
, O
as O
one N
who O
believes O
that O
the O
Democratic O
Party O
has O
meant O
progress N
for O
this O
city N
, O
this O
State N
, O
and O
this O
country N
, O
I H
am O
proud O
to O
be O
here O
in O
Philadelphia O
. O

And O
I H
am O
proud O
to O
be O
here O
with O
your H
mayor H
. O

I H
do O
not O
come O
from O
Philadelphia O
, O
and O
I H
would O
not O
interfere O
, O
but O
I H
am O
hopeful O
and O
confident O
that O
when O
we H
come O
to O
the O
Army N
- O
Navy O
game N
in O
a O
month N
from O
now O
, O
we H
will O
be O
greeted O
by O
the O
new O
mayor H
of O
Philadelphia O
, O
Mayor H
Tale H
. O

I H
haven't O
have O
n't O
given O
a O
political O
speech N
for O
about O
3 O
years N
, O
so O
I H
am O
a O
little O
out H
of O
practice O
, O
but O
I H
am O
gradually O
getting O
back O
into O
it O
. O

And O
I H
am O
glad O
to O
be O
here O
with O
a O
mayor H
who O
follows O
two O
other O
distinguished O
mayors H
of O
this O
city N
, O
who O
carries O
on O
their O
tradition N
- O
Joe H
Clark H
, O
your H
United O
States O
Senator O
who O
was O
a O
great O
mayor H
of O
Philadelphia O
, O
and O
Dick H
Dilworth O
, O
who O
followed O
him O
, O
who O
was O
a O
great O
mayor H
of O
Philadelphia O
. O

That O
is O
the O
tradition N
of O
honest O
, O
progressive O
democratic O
government N
that O
Mayor H
Tate H
carries O
on O
. O

And O
I H
am O
glad O
to O
be O
here O
with O
Judge H
Hoffman H
and O
Senator O
Mahady O
who O
also O
run O
this O
fall N
in O
the O
State N
of O
Pennsylvania O
. O

Everyone O
expects O
things N
of O
Presidents H
, O
but O
I H
am O
not O
sure O
that O
they O
realize O
how O
much O
depends O
upon O
the O
Members H
of O
the O
House O
and O
the O
Members H
of O
the O
Senate O
who O
must O
make O
the O
final O
judgment N
on O
what O
kind N
of O
laws N
a O
President H
must O
execute O
. O

The O
Congressmen O
from O
this O
city N
as O
well O
as O
the O
Senator O
from O
this O
State N
- O
Bill H
Barrett H
and O
Bob H
Nix H
and O
Herman H
Toll O
and O
Jim H
Byrne H
and O
Chairman O
Green H
- O
have O
, O
with O
Joe H
Clark H
supported O
legislation N
month N
in O
and O
month N
out H
that O
benefited O
this O
city N
and O
this O
State N
and O
this O
country N
and O
, O
what O
is O
more O
, O
has O
helped O
make O
the O
United O
States O
meet O
its O
responsibilities N
around O
the O
globe N
. O

So O
what O
you H
do O
in O
this O
city N
counts O
all O
across O
the O
country N
, O
and O
Philadelphia O
has O
sent O
the O
right O
men H
to O
the O
House O
of O
Representatives O
and O
to O
the O
Senate O
of O
the O
United O
States O
. O

And O
I H
am O
also O
proud O
to O
be O
here O
with O
your H
former O
Governor H
who O
is O
now O
working O
for O
us H
in O
Washington H
as O
our H
adviser H
on O
fair O
housing N
, O
Governor H
Dave H
Lawrence H
, O
of O
the O
State N
of O
Pennsylvania O
. O

Three O
years N
ago O
tomorrow N
night N
, O
I H
spoke O
in O
this O
hall N
in O
the O
closing O
days N
of O
the O
1960 O
campaign N
, O
and O
I H
asked O
the O
people N
of O
this O
city N
to O
give O
us H
their O
support N
to O
help O
this O
country N
move O
again O
. O

The O
people N
of O
Philadelphia O
gave O
that O
support N
, O
and O
the O
support N
I H
received O
from O
this O
city N
and O
this O
State N
was O
, O
as O
it O
was O
in O
the O
1960 O
convention N
, O
the O
key N
to O
our H
victory N
across O
the O
country N
. O

I H
am O
back O
in O
Philadelphia O
to O
express O
my H
thanks N
for O
that O
support N
and O
also O
to O
express O
appreciation N
for O
the O
help O
we H
received O
from O
those O
Democrats O
in O
this O
city N
and O
State N
, O
and O
to O
report N
to O
you H
on O
the O
progress N
that O
this O
country N
has O
made O
on O
the O
goals N
that O
were O
outlined O
3 O
years N
ago O
. O

I H
did O
not O
promise N
on O
that O
October O
night N
that O
life N
would O
be O
easy O
in O
the O
Great H
Republic O
. O

I H
did O
not O
say O
we H
would O
not O
have O
new O
pressures N
and O
new O
problems N
. O

Nor O
did O
I H
speak O
of O
swift O
solutions N
in O
100 O
days N
in O
office N
. O

I H
talked O
instead O
about O
the O
kind N
of O
America O
that O
I H
wanted O
for O
my H
family H
and O
for O
your H
family H
and O
all O
those O
who O
are O
citizens H
of O
this O
country N
in O
these O
difficult O
and O
changing O
years N
, O
the O
kind N
of O
America O
in O
which O
I H
believed O
, O
not O
as O
a O
Democrat O
or O
as O
a O
candidate H
, O
but O
as O
a O
citizen H
. O

Today N
, O
in O
many O
ways N
, O
the O
world N
looks O
very O
different O
, O
and O
the O
revolutionary O
change O
of O
pace N
is O
even O
more O
rapid O
than O
it O
has O
been O
in O
the O
past N
. O

But O
there O
has O
been O
no O
change O
in O
my H
concept N
of O
the O
goals N
which O
this O
country N
must O
strive O
for O
if O
it O
is O
to O
meet O
its O
responsibilities N
to O
its O
people N
and O
those O
who O
depend O
upon O
it O
. O

I H
still O
believe O
in O
the O
kind N
of O
America O
which O
I H
described O
in O
this O
hall N
3 O
years N
ago O
, O
and O
I H
am O
still O
determined O
that O
this O
Nation O
shall O
continue O
to O
strive O
to O
meet O
those O
goals N
. O

And O
I H
am O
gratified O
to O
be O
able O
to O
report N
some O
progress N
in O
the O
last O
33 O
1/2 O
months N
. O

I H
said O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
that O
I H
believed O
in O
America O
where O
work N
was O
available O
to O
those O
who O
were O
willing O
and O
able O
to O
work N
, O
where O
the O
waste O
of O
idle O
men H
and O
machines N
could O
be O
avoided O
, O
and O
where O
greater O
economic O
growth N
could O
provide O
the O
new O
jobs N
and O
the O
new O
markets N
that O
our H
growing O
Nation O
needed O
. O

That O
goal N
has O
not O
been O
fully O
achieved O
. O

There O
are O
still O
too O
many O
men H
and O
women H
, O
particularly O
young O
men H
and O
women H
, O
unable O
to O
find O
work N
. O

And O
our H
high O
wartime N
tax N
rates N
still O
prevent O
our H
economy N
from O
growing O
as O
fully O
and O
as O
freely O
as O
it O
must O
. O

But O
one N
fact N
is O
that O
2 O
1/2 O
million O
people N
more O
are O
working O
in O
the O
United O
States O
than O
were O
working O
33 O
months N
ago O
. O

The O
rate N
of O
unemployment N
and O
idle O
capacity N
has O
been O
cut O
, O
and O
our H
economy N
of O
the O
United O
States O
will O
shortly O
pass O
the O
$ O
600 O
billion O
mark N
, O
for O
a O
record N
rise N
-- O
for O
a O
record N
rise N
in O
3 O
years N
of O
$ O
100 O
billion O
-- O
the O
largest O
peacetime N
rise N
in O
the O
history N
of O
the O
United O
States O
. O

And O
if O
we H
can O
obtain O
the O
early O
passage N
of O
an O
effective O
tax N
cut O
which O
the O
House O
of O
Representatives O
has O
already O
passed O
-- O
and O
which O
the O
Ways O
and O
Means O
Committee N
, O
on O
which O
Bill H
Green H
serves O
, O
wrote O
-- O
we H
shall O
be O
sailing O
this O
country N
next O
year N
on O
the O
longest O
and O
strongest O
peacetime N
expansion N
of O
our H
economy N
in O
the O
history N
of O
the O
United O
States O
. O

It O
is O
well O
within O
our H
reach O
. O

Good O
morning N
. O

It O
gives O
me H
great O
pleasure N
to O

Thank O
you H

Well O
, O
good O
evening N
, O
everyone O
. O

I H
am O
very O
honored O
to O
be O
with O
you H
all O
. O

President H
Joe H
Biden O
and O
I H
talk O
often O
about O
our H
mutual O
passion N
for O
everything O
you H
all O
do O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
exciting O
moment N
to O
join O
you H
for O
the O
unveiling N
of O
the O
work N
that O
you H
have O
been O
laboring O
on O
for O

. O

So O
, O
to O
our H
President H
, O
Joe H
Biden O
, O
thank O
you H
for O
your H
leadership N
around O
all O
of O
these O
issues N

Our H
NASA O

and O
the O
Office O

Policy N
Acting O

Thank O
you H
also O
to O
our H
colleagues H
from O
across O
the O
White H
House O
and O
NASA O
and O
everyone O
else O
joining O
us H
from O
home N
. O

So O
, O
yes O
, O
as O
Chair O
of O
the O
National O
Space N
Council N
, O
I H
know O
that O
today N
represents O
an O
exciting O
new O
chapter N
in O
the O
exploration N
of O
our H
universe N
. O

From O
the O
beginning O
of O
history N
, O
humans A
have O
looked O
up O
to O
the O
night N
sky O
with O
wonder O
. O

And O
thanks N
to O
dedicated O
people N
who O
have O
been O
working O
for O
decades N
in O
engineering N
and O
on O
scientific O
marvels N
, O
we H
can O
look O
to O
the O
sky O
with O
new O
understanding N
. O

When O
NASA O
launched O
the O
Hubble O
Space N
Telescope O
in O
1990 O
, O
we H
were O
able O
to O
see O
the O
stars N
unobstructed O
by O
the O
Earth’s O
Earth O
’s H
atmosphere N
and O
understand O
the O
universe N
in O
ways N
we H
could O
have O
never O
imagined O
even O
a O
few O
decades N
earlier O
. O

And O
now O
we H
enter O
a O
new O
phase N
of O
scientific O
discovery N
. O

Building O
on O
the O
legacy N
of O
Hubble O
, O
the O
James H
Webb O
Space N
Telescope O
allows O
us H
to O
see O
deeper O
into O
space N
than O
ever O
before O
and O
in O
stunning O
clarity N
. O

It O
will O
enhance O
what O
we H
know O
about O
the O
origins N
of O
our H
universe N
, O
our H
solar O
system N
, O
and O

made O
possible O
by O
partnership N
among O
nations N

And O
it O
is O
an O
example N
of O
how O
the O
scientific O
endeavor N
can O
build O
upon O
the O
international O
rules N
and O
norms N
that O
govern O
our H
cooperation N

This O
telescope N
is O
one N
of O

And O
the O
images N
we H
will O
see O
today N
are O
a O
testament N
to O
the O
amazing O
work N
done O
by O
the O
thousands N

and O
Technology O
Policy N
. O

It O
really O
is O
a O
matter N
— O
it O
really O
is O
amazing O
. O

Six O
and O
a O
half O
months N
ago O
, O
a O
rocket N
launched O
from O
Earth O
carrying O
the O
world’s O
world N
’s H
newest O
, O
most O
powerful O
deep O
- O
space N
telescope N
on O
a O
journey N
one N
million O
miles N
into O
the O
cosmos N
— O
first O
of O
all O
, O
that O
blows O
my H
mind N
: O
a O
million O
miles N
into O
the O
cosmos N
— O
along O
the O
way N
unfolding O
itself O
, O
deploying O
a O
mirror N
21 O
feet N
wide O
, O
a O
sunshield O
the O
size N
of O
a O
tennis N
court N
, O
and O
250,000 O
tiny O
shutters N
, O
each O
one N
smaller O
than O
a O
grain N
of O
sand N
. O

Put O
together O
, O
it’s O
it O
’s H
a O
new O
window N
into O
the O
history N
of O
our H
universe N
. O

And O
today N
, O
we’re O
we H
’re O
going O
to O
get O
a O
glimpse N
of O
the O
first O
light N
to O
shine N
through O
that O
window N
— O
light N
from O
other O
worlds N
, O
orbiting O
stars N
far O
beyond O
our H
own O
. O

It’s O
It O
’s H
astounding O
to O
me H
when O
I H
read O
this O
and O
saw O
the O
— O
I H
mean O
, O
it O
really O
is O
. O

It’s O
It O
’s H
— O
it’s O
it O
’s H
— O
anyway O
, O
I H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
want O
to O
— O
I’ll O
I H
’ll O
see O
what O
they O
think O
when O
we H
see O
this O
. O

But O
light N
where O
stars N
were O
born O
and O
from O
where O
they O
die O
. O

Light O
from O
the O
oldest O
galaxies N
. O

The O
oldest O
documented O
light N
in O
the O
history N
of O
the O
universe N
from O
over O
13 O
billion O
— O
let O
me H
say O
that O
again O
: O
13 O
billion O
years N
ago O
. O

It’s O
It O
’s H
hard O
to O
even O
fathom O
. O

Tomorrow N
, O
when O
this O
image N
is O
shared O
with O
the O
world N
, O
it O
will O
be O
a O
historic O
moment N
for O
science N
and O
technology N
, O
for O
astronomy N
and O
space N
exploration N
, O
for O
America O
and O
all O
of O
humanity N
. O

You H
know O
, O
as O
an O
international O
collaboration N
, O
this O
telescope N
embodies O
how O
America O
leads O
the O
world N
not O
by O
the O
example N
of O
our H
power N
, O
but O
the O
power N
of O
our H
example N
. O

A H
partnership N
with O
others O
, O
it O
symbolizes O
the O
relentless O
spirit N
of O
American O
ingenuity N
. O

And O
it O
shows N
what O
we H
can O
achieve O
, O
what O
more O
we H
can O
discover O
, O
not O
just O
about O
distant O
places N
, O
but O
about O
our H
very O
own O
planet N
and O
climate N
, O
like O
NASA’s O
NASA O
’s H
Earth O
System O
Observatory O
that O
we H
launched O
last O
year N
. O

That’s O
That O
’s H
why O
the O
federal O
government N
must O
invest O
— O
must O
invest O
in O
science N
and O
technology N
, O
more O
than O
we H
have O
in O
the O
past N
. O

These O
images N
are O
going O
to O
remind O
the O
world N
that O
America O
can O
do O
big O
things N
. O

And O
they’ll O
they O
’ll O
remind O
the O
American O
people N
, O
especially O
our H
children H
, O
that O
there’s O
there O
’s H
nothing N
beyond O
our H
capacity N
— O
nothing N
beyond O
our H
capacity N
. O

We H
can O
see O
possibilities N
no O
one N
has O
ever O
seen O
before O
. O

We H
can O
go O
places N
no O
one N
has O
ever O
gone O
before O
. O

You H
know O
, O
you’ve O
you H
’ve O
— O
you’ve O
you H
’ve O
heard O
me H
say O
it O
over O
and O
over O
again O
. O

America O
is O
defined O
by O
one N
single O
word N
: O
possibilities N
. O

Possibilities N
. O

I H
want O
to O
thank O
the O
team N
at O
NASA O
for O
once O
again O
showing O
that O
that’s O
that O
’s H
who O
we H
are O
— O
that’s O
that O
’s H
who O
we H
are O
as O
a O
nation N
: O
a O
nation N
of O
possibilities N
. O

And O
now O
let’s O
let O
’s H
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
very O
first O
image N
from O
this O
miraculous O
telescope N
. O

Wow O
. O

Whoa O

That O
is O
some O
group N
of O
people N

New H
York H
. O

And O
it's O
it O
's H
an O
honor N
to O

beyond O
anybody's O
anybody O

expectations N

There's O
There O

some O
of O
the O
candidates H

- O
conditioner N
didn't O
did O

work N
. O

They O
sweated O
like O
dogs A
. O

They O
didn't O
did O
n't O
know O
the O
room N
was O
too O
big O
, O
because O
they O
didn't O
did O

. O

How O

ISIS O
? O

I H
don't O

it's O
it O

. O

Our H
country N
is O
in O
serious O
trouble N
. O

We H
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
victories N
anymore O
. O

We H
used O
to O
have O
victories N
, O
but O
we H
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
them O
. O

When O
was O
the O
last O
time N
anybody O

They O

their O
cars N
over O
by O
the O
millions N
, O
and O
what O

? O

When O
was O
the O
last O
time N
you H

a O
Chevrolet O
in O
Tokyo O

It O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
exist O
, O
folks N
. O

They O
beat O
us H
all O
the O
time N
. O

When O
do O
we H
beat O
Mexico O
at O
the O
border N
? O

They're O
They O
're O
laughing O
at O
us H
, O
at O
our H
stupidity N
. O

And O
now O
they O
are O
beating N
us H
economically O
. O

They O
are O
not O
our H
friend H
, O
believe O
me H
. O

But O
they're O
they O
're O
killing O
us H
economically O
. O

The O
U.S. O
has O
become O
a O
dumping N
ground N
for O
everybody O
else's O
else O
's H
problems N
. O

Thank O
you H
. O

It's O
It O
's H
true O
, O
and O
these O
are O
the O
best O
and O
the O
finest O
. O

When O
Mexico O
sends O
its O
people N
, O
they're O
they O
're O
not O
sending O
their O
best O
. O

They're O
They O
're O
not O
sending O
you H
. O

They're O
They O
're O
not O
sending O
you H
. O

They're O
They O
're O
sending O
people N
that O
have O
lots N
of O
problems N
, O
and O
they're O
they O
're O
bringing O
those O
problems N
with O
us H
. O

They're O
They O
're O
bringing O
drugs N
. O

They're O
They O
're O
bringing O
crime N
. O

They're O
They O
're O
rapists H
. O

And O
some O
, O
I H
assume O
, O
are O
good O
people N
. O

But O
I H
speak O
to O
border N
guards H
and O
they O
tell O
us H
what O
we're O
we H
're O
getting O
. O

And O
it O
only O
makes O
common O
sense N
. O

It O
only O
makes O
common O
sense N
. O

They're O
They O
're O
sending O
us H
not O
the O
right O
people N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
coming O
from O
more O
than O
Mexico O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
coming O
from O
all O
over O
South O
and O
Latin O
America O
, O
and O
it's O
it O
's H
coming O
probably O
— O
probably O
— O
from O
the O
Middle O
East O
. O

But O
we H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Because O
we H
have O
no O
protection N
and O
we H
have O
no O
competence N
, O
we H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
what's O
what O
's H
happening O
. O

And O
it's O
it O
's H
got O
to O
stop N
and O
it's O
it O
's H
got O
to O
stop N
fast O
. O

Islamic O
terrorism N
is O
eating O
up O
large O
portions N
of O
the O
Middle O
East O
. O

They've O
They O
've O
become O
rich O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
in O
competition N
with O
them O
. O

They O
just O
built O
a O
hotel N
in O
Syria O
. O

Can O
you H
believe O
this O
? O

They O
built O
a O
hotel N
. O

When O
I H
have O
to O
build O
a O
hotel N
, O
I H
pay O
interest N
. O

They O
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
pay O
interest N
, O
because O
they O
took O
the O
oil N
that O
, O
when O
we H
left O
Iraq O
, O
I H
said O
we H
should've O
should O
've O
taken O
. O

So O
now O
ISIS O
has O
the O
oil N
, O
and O
what O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
, O
Iran O
has O
. O

And O
in O
19 O
— O
and O
I H
will O
tell O
you H
this O
, O
and O
I H
said O
it O
very O
strongly O
, O
years N
ago O
, O
I H
said O
— O
and O
I H
love O
the O
military O
, O
and O
I H
want O
to O
have O
the O
strongest O
military O
that O
we've O
we H
've O
ever O
had O
, O
and O
we H
need O
it O
more O
now O
than O
ever O
. O

But O
I H
said O
, O
" O
Don't O
Do O
n't O
hit O
Iraq O
, O
" O
because O
you're H
you H
're O
going O
to O
totally O
destabilize O
the O
Middle O
East O
. O

Iran O
is O
going O
to O
take O
over O
the O
Middle O
East O
, O
Iran O
and O
somebody H
else O
will O
get O
the O
oil N
, O
and O
it O
turned O
out H
that O
Iran O
is O
now O
taking O
over O
Iraq O
. O

Think O
of O
it O
. O

Iran O
is O
taking O
over O
Iraq O
, O
and O
they're O
they O
're O
taking O
it O
over O
big O
league N
. O

We H
spent O
$ O
2 O
trillion N
in O
Iraq O
, O
$ O
2 O
trillion N
. O

We H
lost O
thousands N
of O
lives O
, O
thousands N
in O
Iraq O
. O

We H
have O
wounded O
soldiers H
, O
who O
I H
love O
, O
I H
love O
— O
they're O
they O
're O
great O
— O
all O
over O
the O
place N
, O
thousands N
and O
thousands N
of O
wounded O
soldiers H
. O

And O
we H
have O
nothing N
. O

We H
can't O
ca O
n't O
even O
go O
there O
. O

We H
have O
nothing N
. O

And O
every O
time N
we H
give O
Iraq O
equipment N
, O
the O
first O
time N
a O
bullet N
goes O
off O
in O
the O
air N
, O
they O
leave O
it O
. O

Last O
week N
, O
I H
read O
2,300 O
Humvees O
— O
these O
are O
big O
vehicles N
— O
were O
left O
behind O
for O
the O
enemy N
. O

2,000 O
? O

You H
would O
say O
maybe O
two O
, O
maybe O
four O
? O

2,300 O
sophisticated O
vehicles N
, O
they O
ran O
, O
and O
the O
enemy N
took O
them O
. O

We H
need O
Trump H
now O
. O

You're O
You H
're O
right O
. O

We H
need O
Trump H
now O
. O

Last O
quarter N
, O
it O
was O
just O
announced O
our H
gross O
domestic O
product N
— O
a O
sign N
of O
strength N
, O
right O
? O

But O
not O
for O
us H
. O

It O
was O
below O
zero O
. O

Whoever O
heard O
of O
this O
? O

It's O
It O
's H
never O
below O
zero O
. O

Our H
labor N
participation N
rate N
was O
the O
worst O
since O
1978 O
. O

But O
think O
of O
it O
, O
GDP O
below O
zero O
, O
horrible O
labor N
participation N
rate N
. O

And O
our H
real O
unemployment N
is O
anywhere O
from O
18 O
to O
20 O
percent N
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
believe O
the O
5.6 O
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
believe O
it O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
right O
. O

A H
lot N
of O
people N
up O
there O
can't O
ca O
n't O
get O
jobs N
. O

They O
can't O
ca O
n't O
get O
jobs N
, O
because O
there O
are O
no O
jobs N
, O
because O
China O
has O
our H
jobs N
and O
Mexico O
has O
our H
jobs N
. O

They O
all O
have O
jobs N
. O

But O
the O
real O
number N
, O
the O
real O
number N
is O
anywhere O
from O
18 O
to O
19 O
and O
maybe O
even O
21 O
percent N
, O
and O
nobody H
talks N
about O
it O
, O
because O
it's O
it O
's H
a O
statistic N
that's O
that O
's H
full O
of O
nonsense N
. O

We H

The O
Texas O
War N
for O
Independence O

Many O
Americans O
who O
migrated O
to O
Texas O
at O
the O
invitation N
of O
the O
Mexican O
government N
did O
not O
completely O
shed O
their O
identity N
or O
loyalty N
to O
the O
United O
States O
. O

They O
brought O
American O
traditions N
and O
expectations N
with O
them O
( O
including O
, O
for O
many O
, O
the O
right O
to O
own O
slaves H
) O
. O

For O
instance N
, O
the O
majority N
of O
these O
new O
settlers H
were O
Protestant O
, O
and O
though O
they O
were O
not O
required O
to O
attend O
the O
Catholic H
mass O
, O
Mexico's O
Mexico O
's H
prohibition N
on O
the O
public O
practice O
of O
other O
religions N
upset O
them O
and O
they O
routinely O
ignored O
it O
. O

Accustomed O
to O
representative O
democracy N
, O
jury N
trials N
, O
and O
the O
defendant’s O
defendant H
’s H
right O
to O
appear O
before O
a O
judge H
, O
the O
Anglo O
- O
American O
settlers H
in O
Texas O
also O
disliked O
the O
Mexican O
legal O
system N
, O
which O
provided O
for O
an O
initial O
hearing O
by O
an O
alcalde O
, O
an O
administrator H
who O
often O
combined O
the O
duties N
of O
mayor H
, O
judge H
, O
and O
law N
enforcement N
officer H
. O

The O
alcalde O
sent O
a O
written O
record N
of O
the O
proceeding O
to O
a O
judge H
in O
Saltillo O
, O
the O
state N
capital N
, O
who O
decided O
the O
outcome N
. O

Settlers H
also O
resented O
that O
at O
most O
two O
Texas O
representatives H
were O
allowed O
in O
the O
state N
legislature N
. O

Their O
greatest O
source N
of O
discontent N
, O
though O
, O
was O
the O
Mexican O
government's O
government N
's H
1829 O
abolition N
of O
slavery N
. O

Most O
American O
settlers H
were O
from O
southern O
states N
, O
and O
many O
had O
brought O
slaves H
with O
them O
. O

Mexico O
tried O
to O
accommodate O
them O
by O
maintaining O
the O
fiction N
that O
the O
slaves H
were O
indentured O
servants H
. O

But O
American O
slaveholders H
in O
Texas O
distrusted O
the O
Mexican O
government N
and O
wanted O
Texas O
to O
be O
a O
new O
U.S. O
slave H
state N
. O

The O
dislike N
of O
most O
for O
Roman H
Catholicism N
( O
the O
prevailing O
religion N
of O
Mexico O
) O
and O
a O
widely O
held O
belief N
in O
American O
racial O
superiority N
led O
them O
generally O
to O
regard N
Mexicans O
as O
dishonest O
, O
ignorant O
, O
and O
backward O
. O

Belief N

their O
own O
superiority N
inspired O
some O
Texans O
to O
try O
to O
undermine O
the O
power N
of O
the O
Mexican O

When O

Haden O
Edwards H
attempted O
to O
evict O
people N
who O
had O
settled O
his O
land O

before O
he O
gained O
title N
to O
it O
, O
the O
Mexican O
government N
nullified O
its O
agreement N
with O
him O
. O

Outraged O
, O
Edwards H
and O
a O
small O
party N
of O
men H
took O
prisoner H
the O
alcalde O
of O
Nacogdoches O
. O

The O
Mexican O
army N
marched O
to O
the O
town N

and O
Edwards H
and O
his O
troops N
then O
declared O
the O
formation N

the O
Republic O
of O
Fredonia O
between O
the O
Sabine O

. O

To H
demonstrate O
loyalty N

their O
adopted O
country N

a O
force N
led O
by O
Stephen H
Austin H
hastened O
to O
Nacogdoches O
to O
support N
the O
Mexican O
army N
. O

Edwards’s O
Edwards H
’s H
revolt N
collapsed O
, O
and O
the O
revolutionaries H
fled O
Texas O
. O

The O
growing O
presence N
of O
American O
settlers H
in O
Texas O
, O
their O
reluctance N
to O
abide O
by O
Mexican O
law N
, O
and O
their O
desire N
for O
independence N
caused O
the O
Mexican O
government N
to O
grow O
wary O
. O

In O
1830 O
, O
it O
forbade O
future N
U.S. O
immigration N
and O
increased O
its O
military O
presence N
in O
Texas O
. O

Settlers H
continued O
to O
stream O
illegally O
across O
the O
long O
border N
; O
by O
1835 O
, O
after O
immigration N
resumed O
, O
there O
were O
twenty O
thousand O
Anglo O
- O
Americans O
in O
Texas O
. O

Fifty O
- O
five O
delegates H
from O
the O
Anglo O

American O
settlements N
gathered O
in O
1831 O
to O
demand N
the O
suspension N
of O
customs N

, O
the O
resumption N
of O
immigration N
from O
the O
United O

, O
better O

April O
1833 O

Texans O
' O
hopes N

quashed O
in O

however O
, O
when O
Santa H

dismissed O
the O
Mexican O
Congress N

abolished O
all O
state N
governments N
, O
including O
that O
of O
Coahuila O

In O
January O
1835 O
, O
reneging O
on O
earlier O
promises O
, O
he O
dispatched O
troops N
to O
the O
town N

Anahuac O
to O
collect O
customs N

William H

Now O
more O
cautious O
, O
delegates H
to O
the O
Consultation O
of O
1835 O
at O
San O
Felipe O
de O
Austin H
voted O
against O
declaring O
independence N
, O
instead O
drafting O
a O
statement N
, O
which O
became O
known O
as O
the O
Declaration O
of O
Causes N
, O
promising O
continued O
loyalty N
if O
Mexico O
returned O
to O
a O
constitutional O
form N
of O
government N
. O

They O
selected O
Henry H
Smith H
, O
leader H
of O
the O
Independence O
Party O
, O
as O
governor H
of O
Texas O
and O
placed O
Sam H

been O
a O

governor H
of O
Tennessee O
, O
in O

its O
small O
military O
force N

The O
Consultation O
delegates H
met O
again O
in O
March O
1836 O
. O

They O
declared O
their O
independence N
from O
Mexico O
and O
drafted O
a O
constitution N
calling O
for O
an O
American O
- O
style N
judicial O
system N
and O
an O
elected O
president H

legislature N

Significantly O
, O
they O
also O
established O
that O
slavery N

not O
be O
prohibited O
in O
Texas O
. O

Many O
wealthy O
Tejanos O
supported O
the O
push O
for O

hoping O
for O
liberal O
governmental O
reforms N

economic O
benefits N

Remember O
the O
Alamo O
! O

Mexico O
had O
no O
intention N
of O
losing O
its O
northern O
province N
. O

Santa H
Anna H
and O
his O
army N
of O
four O
thousand O
had O
besieged O
San O
Antonio H
in O
February O
1836 O
. O

Hopelessly O
outnumbered O
, O
its O
two O
hundred O
defenders H
, O
under O
Travis H
, O
fought O
fiercely O
from O
their O
refuge N
in O
an O
old O
mission N
known O
as O
the O
Alamo O
. O

After O
ten O
days N
, O
however O
, O
the O
mission N
was O
taken O
and O
all O
but O
a O
few O
of O
the O
defenders H
were O
dead O
, O
including O
Travis H
and O
James H
Bowie H
, O
the O
famed O
frontiersman H
who O
was O
also O
a O
land O
speculator H

male O
survivors H
, O
possibly O
including O
the O

legend N
and O
former O
Tennessee O
congressman H
Davy H
Crockett O
, O
were O
led O
outside O
the O
walls N
and O
executed O
. O

The O
few O
women H

children H
inside O
the O
mission N

allowed O
to O
leave O
with O
the O
only O
adult O

by O
Travis H
who O

Consider O
this O

A H

comes O
to O
class N
one N
day N

and O
the O

, O
“ O

all O
a O

I’m O
I H
’m O
flunking O
the O

” O

Imagine O
then O
that O
the O

simply O
stands O
there O
after O
that O
announcement N

blinking O
calmly O
as O
the O
class N
erupts O
in O

Now O
imagine O
that O

scenario N
with O
one N
very O
slight O

The O
instructor H
announces O

“ O
I’ve O

” O

Then O
, O
as O
the O
class N
erupts O
in O

, O
the O
instructor H
calmly O
blinks O
one N
eye N

leaving O

related O

What O
just O
happened O
there O
? O

Blinking O
is O
a O
biological O
compulsion N
common O
to O
humans A
everywhere O
. O

Humans A
blink O
to O
keep O
eyes N
hydrated O
and O
clear N
of O
debris N
. O

Humans A
are O
born O
knowing O
how O
to O
blink O
; O
nobody H
has O
to O
teach O
us H
. O

On O
average O
, O
humans A
blink O
15 O
to O
20 O
times N
every O
minute O
. O

Without O
realizing O
it O
, O
people N
are O
necessarily O
blinking O
throughout O
every O
conversation N
, O
every O
social O
interaction N
, O
every O
activity N
during O
the O
day N
. O

The O
people N
we H
talk O
to O
and O
interact O
with O
are O
also O
blinking O
constantly O
, O
so O
often O
that O
everyone O
is O
accustomed O
to O
ignoring O
it O
. O

Blinking O
does O
not O
affect O
the O
perceived O
meaning N
of O
speech N
or O
actions N
. O

But O
if O
someone H
deliberately O
blinks O
one N
eye N
, O
leaving O
the O
other O
one N
open O
, O
that’s O
that O
’s H
a O
completely O
different O
matter N
. O

In O
fact N
, O
leaving O
one N
eye N
open O
makes O
a O
blink O
a O
wink N
. O

Winking O
is O
not O
a O
biological O
necessity N
. O

Humans A
are O
not O
born O
knowing O
to O
how O
to O
wink N
, O
and O
it O
takes O
some O
practice O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
do O
it O
. O

Because O
it O
requires O
deliberate O
effort N
and O
people N
are O
not O
constantly O
doing O
it O
, O
winking N
can O
acquire O
special O
meaning N
in O
social O
interactions N
. O

In O
American O
culture N
( O
and O
many O
others O
) O
, O
a O
wink N
often O
indicates O
that O
someone H
is O
joking O
around O
and O
that O
whatever O
they’ve O
they O
’ve O
just O
said O
or O
done O
should O
not O
be O
taken O
seriously O
. O

Of O
course N
, O
a O
wink N
can O
mean O
different O
things N
in O
different O
societies N
. O

Moreover O
, O
a O
wink N
can O
mean O
different O
things N
in O
the O
same O
society N
. O

If O
someone H
on O
a O
date N
takes O
their O
companion’s O
companion H
’s H
hand N
and O
gives O
a O
cute O
little O
wink N
, O
the O
person H
may O
have O
reason N
to O
hope O
the O
winker H
is O
not O
just O
joking O
around O
. O

American O
cultural O
anthropologist H
Clifford H
Geertz O
( O
1973 O
) O
used O
the O
example N
of O
winking N
to O
illustrate O
two O
important O
aspects N
of O
culture N
. O

First O
, O
culture N
is O
learned O
. O

Innate O
human O
behaviors N
— O
that O
is O
, O
behaviors N
that O
people N
are O
born O
with O
— O
are O
biological O
, O
not O
cultural O
. O

Blinking O
is O
biological O
. O

Acquired O
human O
behaviors N
— O
that O
is O
, O
behaviors N
that O
people N
are O
taught O
— O
are O
cultural O
. O

Winking O
is O
cultural O
. O

This O
means N
that O
cultural O
behaviors N
are O
not O
genetically O
inherited O
from O
generation N
to O
generation N
but O
must O
be O
passed O
down O
from O
older O
members H
of O
a O
society N
to O
younger O
members H
. O

This O
process N
, O
as O
you’ll O
you H
’ll O
recall O
from O
What O
is O
Anthropology N
? O
is O
called O
enculturation N
. O

Some O
aspects N
of O
enculturation N
are O
deliberate O
and O
systematic O
, O
such O
as O
learning O
the O
rules N
of O
written O
punctuation N
in O
a O
language N
. O

At O
some O
point N
in O
an O
English O
speaker’s O
speaker N
’s H
childhood N
, O
someone H
explicitly O
told O
them O
the O
difference N
between O
a O
question N
mark N
and O
an O
exclamation N
point N
. O

Most O
likely O
, O
they O
learned O
this O
distinction N
in O
school N
, O
a O
fundamental O
institution N
of O
enculturation N
in O
many O
societies N
. O

Religious O
institutions N
are O
another O
common O
force N
of O
enculturation N
, O
providing O
explicit O
instruction N
in O
cultural O
rules N
of O
morality N
and O
social O
interaction N
. O

Extracurricular O
activities N
such O
as O
sports N
, O
dance O
, O
and O
music N
lessons N
also O
teach O
children H
cultural O
rules N
and O
norms N
. O

While O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
very O
important O
cultural O
content N
is O
deliberately O
conveyed O
in O
these O
systematic O
contexts N
, O
the O
greater O
part N
of O
culture N
is O
acquired O
unconsciously O
by O
happenstance N
— O
that O
is O
, O
nobody H
planned O
to O
teach O
it O
, O
and O
no O
one N
made O
an O
effort N
to O
consciously O
try O
to O
learn O
it O
. O

By O
virtue N
of O
growing O
up O
in O
a O
culture N
, O
children H
learn O
what O
certain O
actions N
and O
objects N
mean O
, O
how O
their O
society N
operates O
, O
and O
what O
the O
rules N
are O
for O
appropriate O
behavior N
. O

Going O
back O
to O
the O
cultural O
notion N
of O
home N
, O
did O
anyone O
ever O
explain O
to O
you H
why O
your H
childhood N
home N
was O
structured O
in O
a O
certain O
way N
? O

Did O
anyone O
ever O
point N
out H
the O
cultural O
assumptions N
about O
gender N
and O
family H
built O
into O
your H
house N
? O

Probably O
not O
. O

Now O
, O
imagine O
that O
you H
were O
taken O
away O
from O
your H
parents H
as O
a O
baby H
and O
adopted O
by O
a O
family H
far O
away O
, O
with O
a O
very O
different O
way N
of O
life N
situated O
in O
a O
very O
different O
environment N
. O

With O
your H
adoptive O
family H
, O
you H
might O
have O
been O
raised O
in O
a O
very O
different O
kind N
of O
home N
. O

Growing O
up O
, O
your H
everyday O
habits N
, O
activities N
, O
and O
expectations N
would O
have O
been O
shaped O
by O
the O
setup N
of O
that O
home N
. O

Living O
in O
that O
house N
, O
you H
would O
have O
wordlessly O
absorbed O
a O
set O
of O
assumptions N
about O
family H
, O
gender N
, O
work N
, O
leisure N
, O
hospitality N
, O
and O
property N
. O

And O
all O
of O
it O
would O
seem O
quite O
natural O
to O
you H
. O

Many O
forms N
of O
culture N
are O
passed O
down O
through O
a O
combination N
of O
deliberate O
and O
unconscious O
processes N
. O

Perhaps O
when O
you H
were O
a O
child H
, O
someone H
told O
you H
what O
a O
wink N
was O
and O
showed O
you H
how O
to O
accomplish O
one N
; O
or O
perhaps O
you H
just O
witnessed O
a O
few O
winks N
, O
figured O
out H
what O
they O
meant O
from O
their O
contexts N
, O
and O
then O
learned O
how O
to O
accomplish O
one N
through O
trial N
and O
error N
. O

Geertz O
pointed O
out H
that O
there O
are O
two O
important O
aspects N
to O
winking N
: O
the O
meaning N
and O
the O
action N
. O

As O
both O
are O
learned O
, O
both O
are O
cultural O
. O

But O
perhaps O
more O
importantly O
, O
both O
the O
standardized O
action N
of O
winking N
and O
the O
assumed O
meaning N
of O
this O
action N
are O
commonly O
known O
among O
members H
of O
a O
group N
. O

That O
is O
, O
culture N
is O
shared O
. O

A H
relevant O
question N
to O
our H
concern N
might O
be O
, O
would O
this O
artistic O
excellence N
in O
the O
Chinese O
tradition N
be O
the O
same O
as O
beauty N
? O

Arguably O
, O
beauty N
is O
regarded O
as O
the O
keyword O
in O
Western O
art N
tradition N
since O
antiquity N
. O

If O
we H
browse N
Chinese O
classical O
writings N
on O
art N
criticism N
, O
a O
striking O
difference N
manifests O
— O
there O
the O
category N
of O
mei O
or O
beauty N
does O
not O
have O
a O
dominant O
presence N
. O

For O
instance N
, O
among O
the O
24 O
aesthetic O
categories N
of O
poetry N
listed O
by O
Sikong O

( O

, O
only O
three O
or O
four O
categories N
can O
be O
regarded O
as O
related O
to O
the O
Western O
notion N
of O
beauty N
. O

Moreover O
, O
according O
to O

finds O
that O
the O

beautiful O

To H
conclude O

in O

it O

CONTEMPORARY O
DISCOURSE N
: O
BRIEF O
REMARK N

The O
Hegelian O
definition N
of O
aesthetics N
as O
the O
philosophy N
of O
art N
that O
considers O
the O
issue N
of O
artistic O
beauty N
as O
its O
core N
concern N
is O
no O
more O
enchanting O
in O
our H
time N
. O

Many O
would O
agree O
that O
the O
question N
“ O
what O
makes O
an O
artwork N
beautiful O
” O
plays N
a O
minor O
role N
in O
contemporary O
aesthetics N
and O
philosophy N
of O
art N
, O
where O
the O
question N
has O
been O
updated O
to O
“ O
what O
makes O
an O
artwork N
meaningful O
or O
valuable O
? O
” O

Two O
factors N
might O
contribute O
to O
this O
situation N
. O

Firstly O
, O
it O
is O
not O
a O
coincidence N
that O
the O
loss N
of O
interest N
in O
the O
inquiry N
into O
artistic O
beauty N
coincides O
with O
a O
sea N
change O
in O
the O
artworld O
, O
transformed O
by O
new O
art N
movements N
as O
well O
as O
struggles N
in O
defining O
art N
. O

Being O
beautiful O
is O
no O
longer O
a O
defining O
feature N
of O
art N
. O

Also O
, O
when O
the O
representationalism O
, O
the O
expression N
theories N
, O
formalism N
, O
neoformalism O
, O
aesthetic O
theories N
in O
defining O
art N
all O
fail O
to O
offer O
an O
account O
that O
is O
capable O
of O
coping N
with O
the O
dynamic O
scenes N
of O
the O
artworld O
, O
and O
when O
the O
anti-essentialist O
movement N
in O
philosophical O
aesthetics N
then O
paves O
a O
way N
to O
functionalism N
, O
institutionalism O
and O
various O
versions N
of O
historicism N
, O
the O
question N
of O
artistic O
beauty N
as O
such O
not O
only O
loses O
its O
limelight N
, O
but O
also O
is O
, O
to O
some O
extent N
, O
abandoned O
for O
its O
strong O
Hegelian O
colour N
. O

Now O
if O
“ O
art N
” O
itself O
becomes O
an O
open O
concept N
or O
a O
socially O
, O
historically O
, O
culturally O
sensitive O
notion N
, O
then O
whatever O
makes O
an O
artwork N
beautiful O
is O
unlikely O
to O
be O
something O
homogeneous O
and O
unitary O
. O

Secondly O
, O
the O
inquiry N
into O
“ O
beauty N
” O
experienced O
a O
shift N
of O
focus O
from O
the O
emphasis N
on O
aesthetic O
properties N
of O
the O
objects N
to O
the O
subjective O
experience N
involved O
in O
aesthetic O
appreciation N
. O

In O
other O
words N
, O
a O
shift N
from O
an O
inquiry N
about O
“ O
the O
beauty N
of O
object N
” O
to O
the O
issue N
of O
“ O
the O
pleasure N
of O
beauty N
. O
” O

The O
contemporary O
inquiry N
into O
beauty N
in O
general O
is O
often O
classified O
in O
light N
of O
the O
framework N
of O
realism N
vs O
non-realism O
. O

Realism O
regards O
artistic O
beauty N
as O
a O
property N
of O
artworks N
which O
is O
independent O
of O
the O
subject O
, O
while O
non-realism O
holds O
that O
artistic O
beauty N
is O
not O
an O
independent O
property N
of O
artworks N
. O

This O
shift N
has O
a O
long O
historical O
preparation N
, O
contributed O
especially O
by O
the O
British O
empiricists H
such O
as O
Francis H
Hutcheson O
( O
1694 O
– O
1746 O
) O
and O
David H
Hume H
( O
1711 O
– O
1776 O
) O
. O

Hutcheson O
thinks O
that O
beauty N
lies N
in O
both O
the O
object N
and O
the O
subject O
, O
and O
artistic O
beauty N
comes O
from O
the O
quality N
of O
“ O
uniformity N
amidst O
variety N
” O
in O
the O
object N
and O
the O
involvement N
of O
an O
“ O
internal O
sense N
” O
in O
the O
subject O
. O
[ O
39 O
] O

Hume H
argues O
that O
“ O
beauty N
is O
no O
quality N
in O
things N
themselves O
, O
” O
but O
a O
“ O
sentiment N
” O
in O
“ O
the O
mind N
that O
contemplates O
them O
” O
and O
“ O
to O
seek O
the O
real O
beauty N
… O
is O
… O
fruitless O
. O
” O
[ O
40 O
] O

In O
contemporary O
aesthetics N
, O
from O
the O
study O
of O
empathy N
to O
Freud’s O
Freud H
’s H
libido N
, O
to O
the O
evolutionary O
theory N
of O
beauty N
, O
to O
the O
focus O
on O
perception N
in O
aesthetic O
experience N
, O
more O
and O
more O
philosophers H
seek O
to O
answer N
the O
question N
of O
what O
makes O
an O
artwork N
beautiful O
in O
light N
of O
human O
physiology N
and O
psychology N
. O

For O
instance N
, O
the O
evolutionary O
theory N
regards O
artistic O
beauty N
as O
“ O
fitness N
signal N
” O
that O
displays N
desirable O
personal O
qualities N
that O
strengthen O
reproductive O
advantage N
, O
and O
our H
pleasant O
feeling O
caused O
by O
something O
beautiful O
, O
like O
sexual O
pleasure N
, O
is O
engraved O
in O
our H
minds N
by O
the O
process N
of O
evolution N
, O
assisting O
us H
to O
make O
the O
“ O
the O
most O
adaptive O
decisions N
for O
survival N
and O
reproduction N
. O

: O

Describe O
cognition N

Distinguish O
concepts N
and O
prototypes N

Explain O
the O
difference N
between O
natural O
and O
artificial O
concepts N

Imagine O
all O
of O
your H
thoughts N
as O
if O
they O
were O
physical O
entities N
, O
swirling O
rapidly O
inside O
your H
mind N
. O

How O
is O
it O
possible O
that O
the O
brain N
is O
able O
to O
move O
from O
one N
thought O
to O
the O
next O
in O
an O
organized O
, O
orderly O
fashion N
? O

The O
brain N
is O
endlessly O
perceiving O
, O
processing O
, O
planning O
, O
organizing O
, O
and O
remembering O
— O
it O
is O
always O
active O

Yet O
, O
you H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
notice O
most O
of O
your H

activity N
as O
you H
move O
throughout O
your H
daily O
routine N
. O

This O
is O
only O
one N
facet N
of O
the O
complex O
processes N
involved O
in O
cognition N
. O

Simply O
put O
, O
cognition N
is O
thinking O
, O
and O
it O
encompasses O
the O
processes N
associated O
with O
perception N
, O
knowledge N
, O
problem N
solving N
, O
judgment N
, O
language N
, O
and O
memory N
. O

Scientists H
who O
study O
cognition N
are O
searching O
for O
ways N
to O
understand O
how O
we H
integrate O
, O
organize O
, O
and O
utilize O
our H
conscious O
cognitive O
experiences N
without O
being O
aware O
of O
all O
of O
the O
unconscious O
work N
that O
our H
brains N

doing O
( O
for O
example N

. O

Cognition N

Upon O
waking O
each O
morning N
, O
you H
begin O
thinking O
— O
contemplating O
the O
tasks N
that O
you H
must O
complete O
that O
day N
. O

In O
what O
order O
should O
you H
run O
your H
errands N
? O

Should O
you H
go O
to O
the O
bank N
, O
the O
cleaners N
, O
or O
the O
grocery N
store N
first O
? O

Can O
you H
get O
these O
things N
done O
before O
you H
head N
to O
class N
or O
will O
they O
need O
to O
wait N
until O
school N
is O
done O
? O

These O
thoughts N
are O
one N
example N
of O
cognition N
at O
work N
. O

Exceptionally O
complex O
, O
cognition N
is O
an O
essential O
feature N
of O
human O
consciousness N
, O
yet O
not O
all O
aspects N
of O
cognition N
are O
consciously O
experienced O
. O

Cognitive O
psychology N
is O
the O
field N
of O
psychology N
dedicated O
to O
examining O
how O
people N
think O
. O

It O
attempts N
to O
explain O
how O
and O
why O
we H
think O
the O
way N
we H
do O
by O
studying O
the O
interactions N
among O
human O
thinking O
, O
emotion N
, O
creativity N
, O
language N
, O
and O
problem N
solving N
, O
in O
addition N
to O
other O
cognitive O
processes N
. O

Cognitive O
psychologists H
strive O
to O
determine O
and O
measure N
different O
types N
of O
intelligence N
, O
why O
some O
people N
are O
better O
at O
problem N
solving N
than O
others O
, O
and O
how O
emotional O
intelligence N
affects O
success N
in O
the O
workplace N
, O
among O
countless O
other O
topics N
. O

They O
also O
sometimes O
focus O
on O
how O
we H
organize O
thoughts N
and O
information N
gathered O
from O
our H
environments N
into O
meaningful O
categories N
of O
thought O
, O
which O
will O
be O
discussed O
later O

Concepts N
and O
Prototypes N

The O
human O
nervous O
system N
is O
capable O
of O
handling N
endless O
streams N
of O
information N
. O

The O
senses N
serve O
as O
the O
interface N
between O
the O
mind N
and O
the O
external O
environment N
, O
receiving O
stimuli N
and O
translating O
it O
into O
nervous O
impulses N
that O
are O
transmitted O
to O
the O
brain N
. O

The O
brain N
then O
processes N
this O
information N
and O
uses O
the O
relevant O
pieces N
to O
create O
thoughts N
, O
which O
can O
then O
be O
expressed O
through O
language N
or O
stored O
in O
memory N
for O
future N
use H
. O

To H
make O
this O
process N
more O
complex O
, O
the O
brain N
does O
not O
gather O
information N
from O
external O
environments N
only O
. O

When O
thoughts N
are O
formed O
, O
the O
brain N
also O
pulls O
information N
from O
emotions N
and O
memories N

Sensations N
and O
information N
are O
received O
by O
our H
brains N
, O
filtered O
through O
emotions N
and O
memories N
, O
and O
processed O
to O
become O
thoughts N
. O

In O
order O
to O
organize O
this O
staggering O
amount N
of O
information N
, O
the O
brain N
has O
developed O
a O
file N
cabinet N
of O
sorts N
in O
the O
mind N
. O

The O
different O
files N
stored O
in O
the O
file N
cabinet N
are O
called O
concepts N
. O

Concepts N
are O
categories N
or O
groupings N
of O
linguistic O
information N
, O
images N
, O
ideas N
, O
or O
memories N
, O
such O
as O
life N
experiences N
. O

Concepts N
are O
, O
in O
many O
ways N
, O
big O
ideas N
that O
are O
generated O
by O
observing O
details N
, O
and O
categorizing O
and O
combining O
these O
details N
into O
cognitive O
structures N
. O

You H
use H
concepts N
to O
see O
the O
relationships N
among O
the O
different O
elements N
of O
your H
experiences N
and O
to O
keep O
the O
information N
in O
your H
mind N
organized O
and O
accessible O
. O

Concepts N
are O
informed O
by O
our H
semantic O
memory N
( O
you H
will O
learn O
more O
about O
semantic O
memory N
in O
a O
later O
chapter N
) O
and O
are O
present N
in O
every O
aspect N
of O
our H
lives O
; O
however O
, O
one N
of O
the O
easiest O
places N
to O
notice O
concepts N
is O
inside O
a O
classroom N
, O
where O
they O
are O
discussed O
explicitly O
. O

When O
you H
study O
United O
States O
history N
, O
for O
example N
, O
you H
learn O
about O
more O
than O
just O
individual O
events N
that O
have O
happened O
in O
America’s O
America O
’s H
past N
. O

You H
absorb O
a O
large O
quantity N
of O
information N
by O
listening O
to O
and O
participating O
in O
discussions N
, O
examining O
maps N
, O
and O
reading O
first O
- O
hand N
accounts O
of O
people’s O
people N
’s H
lives O
. O

Your H
brain N
analyzes O
these O
details N
and O
develops O
an O
overall O
understanding N
of O
American O
history N
. O

In O
the O
process N
, O
your H
brain N
gathers O
details N
that O
inform O
and O
refine O
your H
understanding N
of O
related O
concepts N
like O
democracy N
, O
power N
, O
and O
freedom N
. O

Concepts N
can O
be O
complex O
and O
abstract O
, O
like O
justice N
, O
or O
more O
concrete O
, O
like O
types N
of O
birds A
. O

In O
psychology N
, O
for O
example N
, O
Piaget’s O
Piaget O
’s H
stages N
of O
development N
are O
abstract O
concepts N
. O

Some O
concepts N
, O
like O
tolerance N
, O
are O
agreed O
upon O
by O
many O
people N
, O
because O
they O
have O
been O
used O
in O
various O
ways N
over O
many O
years N
. O

Other O
concepts N
, O
like O
the O
characteristics N
of O
your H
ideal N
friend H
or O
your H
family’s O
family H
’s H
birthday N
traditions N
, O
are O
personal O
and O
individualized O
. O

In O
this O
way N
, O
concepts N
touch O
every O
aspect N
of O
our H
lives O
, O
from O
our H
many O
daily O
routines N
to O
the O
guiding O
principles N
behind O
the O
way N
governments N
function N
. O

Another O
technique N
used O
by O
your H
brain N
to O
organize O
information N
is O
the O
identification N
of O
prototypes N
for O
the O
concepts N
you H
have O
developed O
. O

A H
prototype N
is O
the O
best O
example N
or O
representation N
of O
a O
concept N
. O

For O
example N
, O
for O
the O
category N
of O
civil O
disobedience N
, O
your H
prototype N
could O
be O
Rosa H
Parks H
. O

Her O
peaceful O
resistance N
to O
segregation N
on O
a O
city N
bus N
in O
Montgomery H
, O
Alabama O
, O
is O
a O
recognizable O
example N
of O
civil O
disobedience N
. O

Or H
your H
prototype N
could O
be O
Mohandas O
Gandhi H
, O
sometimes O
called O
Mahatma O
Gandhi H
( O
“ O
Mahatma O
” O
is O
an O
honorific O
title N
) O
( O

In O
1930 O

Mohandas O
Gandhi H
led O
a O
group N
in O
peaceful O
protest N
against O
a O
British O

on O

in O

. O

Mohandas O
Gandhi H
served O
as O
a O
nonviolent O
force N
for O
independence N
for O
India O
while O
simultaneously O
demanding O
that O
Buddhist O
, O
Hindu O
, O
Muslim O
, O
and O
Christian H
leaders H

both O
Indian O
and O
British O
— O

peacefully O
. O

Although O
he O
was O
not O
always O
successful O
in O
preventing O
violence N
around O
him O
, O
his O
life N
provides O
a O
steadfast O

of O
the O

Just O
as O
concepts N
can O
be O
abstract O
or O
concrete O
, O
we H
can O
make O
a O
distinction N
between O
concepts N
that O
are O
functions N
of O
our H
direct O
experience N
with O
the O
world N
and O
those O
that O
are O

Your H
Discipline N

Within O
your H
industry N
of O

or O
area N

, O
what O
are O
the O
challenges N
that O
create O

? O

How O
can O
these O
be O

? O

Earlier O
in O

we H
discussed O
Evernote O
, O
a O

that O
focuses O
on O
expanding O
our H

by O

and O
organizing O
information N
. O

Let’s O
Let O
’s H
look O
at O
some O
other O
examples N
of O
entrepreneurial O
endeavors N
in O
specific O
industries N
to O
help O
you H
plan N
your H
own O
venture N
in O
your H
own O
industry N
. O

In O
the O
agriculture N
industry N
, O
insects A
, O
weeds A
, O
weather N
conditions N
, O
and O
the O
challenges N
of O
harvesting N
crops N
are O
all O
ripe O
for O
entrepreneurial O
activities N
. O

The O
move O
toward O
organic O
produce O
has O
also O
affected O
this O
industry N
. O

From O
an O
entrepreneurial O
perspective N
, O
what O
products N
could O
you H
invent O
to O
support N
both O
organic O
farming O
and O
the O
problems N
of O
insects A
that O
damage N
or O
destroy O
crops N
? O

The O
old O
method N
was O
to O
use H
chemical N
sprays N
to O
kill O
the O
insects A
, O
but O
today N
, O
the O
growing O
demand N
for O
organic O
foods N
and O
increased O
awareness N
of O
the O
impact N
of O
chemical N
sprays N
on O
our H
environment N
are O
changing O
this O
scenario N
. O

One O
new O
idea N
to O
solve O
this O
problem N
combines O
a O
vacuum N
cleaner N
with O
an O
agriculture N
product N
. O

LINK N

Watch O
this O
video N
on O
the O
creation N
of O
a O
crop N
vacuum N
that O
sucks O
up O
insects A
and O
bugs A
to O
learn O
more O
. O

A H
bug A
vacuum N
is O
an O
example N
of O
how O
using O
divergent O
thinking O
contributed O
to O
the O
solution N
of O
removing O
bugs A
from O
crops N
without O
using O
chemicals N
. O

In O
the O
group N
activity N
of O
creating O
divergent O
ideas N
, O
this O
idea N
may O
not O
have O
been O
received O
well O
. O

However O
, O
in O
the O
incubation N
stage N
, O
the O
idea N
must O
have O
come O
forward O
as O
a O
viable O
solution N
. O

Entrepreneurs H
frequently O
face N
the O
challenge N
of O
pressure O
to O
conform O
to O
established O
habits N
and O
patterns N
within O
industries N
. O

Often O
, O
the O
entrepreneurial O
mindset N
includes O
futuristic O
ideas N
that O
shake O
up O
the O
normal O
, O
conventional O
processes N
that O
are O
grounded O
in O
experience N
over O
time N
. O

Tried O
- O
and O
- O
tested O
processes N
and O
products N
that O
have O
a O
proven O
history N
of O
success N
can O
be O
a O
formidable O
obstacle N
to O
new O
ideas N
. O

A H
new O
idea N
may O
even O
appear O
as O
impossible O
or O
outlandish O
, O
perhaps O
even O
an O
embarrassment N
to O
the O
steady O
and O
predictable O
practices N
established O
within O
an O
industry N
. O

This O
can O
create O
a O
dilemma N
: O
Do O
we H
try O
something O
new O
and O
unproven O
that O
lacks O
documented O
research N
? O

Sometimes O
, O
we H
must O
disregard N
our H
past N
successes N
and O
research N
to O
be O
open O
to O
new O
possibilities N
for O
success N
and O
failure N
. O

An O
entrepreneurial O
mindset N
includes O
creativity N
, O
problem N
- O
solving N
skills N
, O
and O
a O
propensity N
to O
innovation N
. O
23 O

Open O
- O
mindedness O
is O
one N
characteristic N
that O
supports O
creativity N
, O
problem N
solving N
, O
and O
innovation N
. O

Taking O
the O
time N
to O
explore O
new O
ideas N
, O
dream O
, O
reflect O
, O
and O
view N
situations N
from O
a O
new O
perspective N
contribute O
to O
the O
entrepreneurial O
mindset N
. O

Some O
innovations N
can O
lead O
to O
disruptions N
within O
the O
industry N
, O
or O
even O
create O
a O
new O
industry N
. O

The O
innovator’s O
innovator H
’s H
dilemma N
was O
presented O
by O
Clayton H
Christensen H
to O
explain O
disruptive O
technology N
, O
which O
are O
technologies N
that O
, O
once O
introduced O
, O
displace O
established O
patterns N
, O
processes N
, O
and O
systems N
previously O
accepted O
as O
normal O
or O
accepted O
. O

One O
example N
of O
a O
disruptive O
technology N
is O
Airbnb O
, O
a O
company N
that O
threatens O
the O
established O
hotel N
industry N
by O
connecting O
personal O
resources N
to O
people N
who O
desire N
those O
resources N
. O

If O
you H
have O
a O
spare O
bedroom N
that O
you H
aren’t O
are O
n’t O
using O
, O
why O
not O
sell O
that O
space N
to O
someone H
who O
wants O
and O
needs N
the O
space N
? O

Airbnb O
has O
become O
a O
significant O
threat N
to O
the O
established O
hotel N
industry’s O
industry N
’s H
business N
model N
of O
building N
large O
hotels N
and O
renting O
rooms N
within O
those O
hotels N
to O
their O
customers H
. O

Airbnb O
has O
reconfigured O
that O
model N
, O
and O
since O
its O
2008 O
launch N
, O
150 O
million O
travelers H
have O
taken O
advantage N
of O
3 O
million O
Airbnb O

in O
more O
than O
191 O
countries N

Airbnb O
has O
raised O
more O

$ O
3 O
billion O

plus O
a O
$ O
1 O
billion O
credit N
line N
) O
and O
is O
considering O
selling O

to O
support N
significant O

. O

The O
value N
of O

is O
approximately O
$ O
30 O
billion O

Compare O
this O

If O
you H
were O
the O
CEO O
of O
Hilton H
or O
Marriott O
, O
would O
you H
be O
worried O
? O

The O
hotel N
industry N
recognized O
Airbnb O
as O
a O
threat N
, O
and O
in O
2016 O
, O
began O
a O
campaign N
to O
create O
legislation N
to O
rein O
in O
Airbnb’s O
Airbnb O
’s H
growth N
and O
popularity N
. O

From O
the O
hotel N
industry’s O
industry N
’s H
perspective N
, O
Airbnb O
is O
not O
playing O
by O
the O
same O
rules N
. O

This O
is O
the O
definition N
of O
disruptive O
technology N
, O
the O
focus O
on O
creating O
a O
new O
idea N
or O
process N
that O
negates O
or O
challenges N
established O
process N
or O
products N
. O
24 O

Sometimes O
disruptive O
technologies N
result N
from O
not O
listening O
to O
customers H
. O

Customers H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
always O
know O
what O
they O
want O
. O

Customer H
groups N
might O
need O
to O
be O
redefined O
by O
the O
entrepreneurial O
team N
on O
the O
basis N
of O
better O
models N
, O
knowing O
when O
to O
invest O
in O
developing O
lower O
- O
performance N
products N
that O
promise N
lower O
margins N
while O
still O
satisfying O
the O
need O
, O
and O
knowing O
when O
to O
pursue O
small O
markets N
at O
the O
expense N
of O
larger O
or O
established O
markets N
. O

Basically O
, O
disruptive O
technologies N
occur O
through O
identifying O
new O
and O
valuable O
processes N
and O
products N
. O

The O
founders H
of O
Airbnb O
recognized O
that O
some O
people N
have O
unused O
resources N
, O
bedrooms N
, O
that O
other O
people N
need O
. O

We H
can O
apply O
this O
idea N
to O
other O
unused O
resources N
such O
as O
vehicles N
and O

homes N
. O

Are O
there O
Moral O
Facts N
? O

So O
far O
, O
we H
have O
covered O
how O
evolutionary O
ethics N
relates O
to O
the O
question N
what O
we H
ought O
to O
do O
and O
why O
we H
are O
moral O
in O
the O
first O
place N
. O

A H
related O
set O
of O
questions N
about O
ethics N
are O
metaethical O
questions N
, O
which O
concern N
the O
meaning N
of O
moral O
terms N
, O
our H
ways N
of O
gaining O
knowledge N
of O
moral O
facts N
, O
and O
the O
nature N
of O
the O
moral O
facts N
. O

In O
other O
words N
, O
apart O
from O
thinking O
about O
how O
we H
ought O
to O
live O
, O
and O
where O
our H
moral O
sense N
comes O
from O
, O
we H
can O
also O
ask O
what O
it O
means N
to O
affirm O
a O
particular O
answer N
to O
that O
question N
, O
how O
we H
could O
come O
to O
know O
the O
answer N
, O
and O
whether O
the O
answer N
would O
be O
a O
matter N
of O
fact N
or O
more O
like O
an O
opinion N
. O

Many O
books N
and O
articles N
in O
moral O
philosophy N
start O
with O
the O
observation N
that O
moral O
judgments N
seem O
to O
be O
objectively O
true O
and O
the O
assumption N
that O
this O
is O
how O
non-philosophers O
also O
think O
about O
morality N
. O

For O
example N
, O
Michael H
Smith H
writes O
: O

We H
seem O
to O
think O
moral O
questions N
have O
correct O
answers N
; O
that O
the O
correct O
answers N
are O
made O
correct O
by O
objective N
moral O
facts N
; O
that O
moral O
facts N
are O
wholly O
determined O
by O
circumstances N
; O
and O
that O
, O
by O
engaging O
in O
moral O
conversation N
and O
argument N
, O
we H
can O
discover O
what O
these O
objective N
facts N
are O
. O

( O
Smith H
1994 O
, O
6 O
) O

But O
as O
we H
have O
seen O
above O
, O
evolutionary O
theory N
explains O
why O
we H
would O
think O
that O
moral O
judgments N
are O
objective N
. O

The O
philosopher H
Michael H
Ruse O
takes O
this O
to O
show O
that O
the O
apparent O
objectivity N
of O
morality N
is O
something O
like O
an O
“ O
illusion N
” O
foisted O
on O
us H
by O
our H
genes N
( O
Ruse O
[ O
1986 O
] O
1998 O
, O
253 O
) O
. O

Of O
course N
, O
even O
if O
Ruse O
is O
correct O
, O
this O
does O
not O
show O
that O
moral O
judgments N
are O
not O
objective N
, O
but O
it O
can O
make O
us H
think O
whether O
the O
objectivity N
of O
morality N
really O
has O
to O
be O
explained O
, O
as O
many O
philosophers H
assume O
. O

Ruse O
has O
also O
argued O
that O
an O
evolutionary O
account O
of O
morality N
suggests O
that O
there O
are O
no O
moral O
facts N
in O
the O
first O
place N
. O

Anything O
we H
want O
to O
explain O
about O
morality N
can O
be O
explained O
without O
mentioning O
moral O
facts N
, O
or O
so O
Ruse O
argues O
. O

If O
moral O
facts N
are O
explanatorily O
redundant O
, O
indeed O
, O
moral O
realists H
( O
those O
who O
believe O
there O
are O
mind N
- O
independent O
, O
objective N
facts N
about O
morality N
, O
as O
discussed O
in O
Chapter N
1 O
) O
need O
to O
say O
why O
we H
should O
still O
suppose O
that O
moral O
facts N
do O
exist O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
Ruse’s O
Ruse O
’s H
methodological O
naturalism N
leads O
him O
to O
embrace O
a O
view N
that O
goes O
against O
the O
metaphysical O
naturalist H
position N
that O
moral O
facts N
exist O
. O

Relatedly O
, O
Sharon H
Street H
, O
for O
example N
, O
argues O
that O
evolutionary O
explanations N
of O
morality N
show O
that O
moral O
realism N
is O
probably O
false O
. O

The O
kind N
of O
moral O
realism N
that O
Street H
has O
in O
mind N
is O
the O
view N
that O
moral O
properties N
exist O
as O
objective N
features O
of O
the O
world N
( O
to O
wit N
, O
whether O
stealing O
is O
wrong O
is O
independent O
of O
whether O
anyone O
thinks O
or O
feels O
that O
stealing O
is O
wrong O
) O
. O

Street H
starts O
with O
the O
premise N
that O
our H
moral O
judgments N
are O
influenced O
by O
evolutionary O
forces N
. O

This O
fact N
, O
Street H
claims N
, O
gives O
rise N
to O
a O
dilemma N
for O
moral O
realists H
concerning O
the O
relation N
of O
the O
evolutionary O
forces N
that O
influenced O
our H
moral O
judgments N
and O
the O
moral O
facts N
claimed O
to O
exist O
by O
moral O
realists H
. O

If O
there O
is O
no O
relation N
between O
the O
evolutionary O
forces N
and O
the O
moral O
facts N
, O
then O
it O
would O
be O
an O
astonishing O
coincidence N
if O
many O
of O
our H
moral O
judgments N
were O
true O
. O

In O
light N
of O
the O
coincidence N
, O
we H
have O
no O
reason N
to O
assume O
that O
our H
moral O
judgments N
are O
true O
— O
an O
unpalatable O
conclusion N
for O
realists H
. O

Claiming O
that O
there O
is O
a O
relation N
, O
however O
, O
is O
empirically O
dubious O
, O
according O
to O
Street H
. O

Mirroring O
Ruse’s O
Ruse O
’s H
claim O
, O
moral O
facts N
could O
be O
purged O
from O
what O
we H
assume O
to O
exist O
because O
they O
do O
not O
perform O
an O
important O
explanatory O
function N
. O

So O
, O
we H
should O
reject O
moral O
realism N
. O

Street’s O
Street H
’s H
argument N
illustrates O
how O
evolutionary O
theory N
can O
be O
used O
to O
make O
a O
case N
about O
which O
metaethical O
theories N
we H
should O
adopt O
. O

Both O
Ruse’s O
Ruse O
’s H
and O
Street’s O
Street H
’s H
arguments N
rely O
on O
the O
idea N
that O
we H
should O
only O
accept O
that O
something O
exists O
if O
it O
plays N
an O
indispensable O
explanatory O
role N
and O
there O
are O
means N
to O
resist O
these O
arguments N
. O
[ O
12 O
] O

Both O
arguments N
, O
as O
presented O
here O
, O
rely O
on O
the O
correctness N
of O
the O
evolutionary O
explanation N
of O
morality N
they O
convey O
. O

In O
the O
next O
section N
, O
we H
turn O
to O
the O
relevance N
of O
evolutionary O
ethics N
for O
moral O
epistemology N
. O

E.g. O
Enoch O
( O
2010 O
) O

Can O
We H
have O
Justified O
Moral O
Beliefs N
? O

The O
evolutionary O
argument N
by O
Sharon H
Street H
can O
also O
be O
interpreted O
as O
an O
argument N
about O
moral O
justification N
and O
moral O
knowledge N
. O

Suppose O
that O
moral O
realists H
assume O
that O
there O
is O
no O
relation N
between O
our H
moral O
judgments N
and O
the O
moral O
facts N
. O

It O
would O
seem O
like O
an O
incredible O
coincidence N
if O
the O
realists H
were O
right O
that O
our H
moral O
judgments N
are O
nonetheless O
true O
. O

There O
are O
just O
too O
many O
possible O
moral O
truths N
and O
too O
many O
ways N
in O
which O
evolution N
could O
have O
“ O
pushed O
” O
our H
moral O
beliefs N
. O

Street H
claims N
that O
such O
a O
coincidence N
would O
be O
too O
much O
to O
believe O
. O

But O
what O
is O
the O
problem N
, O
exactly O
, O
with O
having O
beliefs N
that O
are O
only O
coincidentally O
true O
? O

Depending O
on O
how O
we H
understand O
“ O
coincidence N
, O
” O
my H
belief N
that O
there O
is O
a O
bird A
outside O
my H
window N
is O
coincidentally O
true O
because O
had O
I H
looked O
a O
little O
later O
, O
the O
bird A
would O
have O
flown O
away O
already O
. O

Accidentally O
true O
beliefs N
do O
not O
seem O
problematic O
in O
every O
case N
. O

The O
question N
for O
proponents H
of O
Street’s O
Street H
’s H
argument N
is O
to O
show O
why O
the O
evolutionary O
influence N
on O
human O
moral O
beliefs N
makes O
for O
a O
particularly O
problematic O
case N
of O
coincidence N
. O

The O
philosopher H
Richard H
Joyce H
argues O
that O
the O
problem N
has O
to O
do O
with O
the O
sensitivity N
of O
our H
moral O
beliefs N
to O
the O
moral O
facts N
( O
Joyce H
2006 O
) O
. O

Given O
that O
our H
moral O
beliefs N
are O
influenced O
by O
evolutionary O
forces N
, O
and O
not O
by O
the O
moral O
facts N
, O
our H
moral O
beliefs N
would O
be O
the O
same O
even O
if O
the O
moral O
facts N
would O
change O
. O

But O
because O
we H
should O
not O
hold O
on O
to O
such O
insensitive O
beliefs N
, O
evolutionary O
explanations N
of O
morality N
show O
that O
our H
moral O
beliefs N
are O
unjustified O
( O
because O
they O
are O
not O
sensitive O
) O
. O

It O
is O
not O
clear N
, O
however O
, O
whether O
and O
why O
evolutionary O
explanations N
of O
morality N
reveal O
something O
about O
our H
moral O
beliefs N
that O
is O
particularly O
troubling O
from O
an O
epistemological O
perspective N
. O

The O
impact N
of O
evolutionary O
ethics N
on O
epistemological O
questions N
depends O
on O
these O
deeper O
questions N
about O
epistemology N
. O
[ O
13 O
] O

Evolutionary O
explanations N
of O
morality N
, O
however O
, O
provide O
us H
with O
a O
useful O
starting O
point N
for O
thinking O
about O
these O
questions N
. O

See O
Klenk O
( O
2019 O
) O
. O

CONCLUSION N

Evolutionary O
ethics N
has O
helped O
us H
to O
get O
a O
much O
clearer O
sense N
of O
where O
the O
human O
moral O
sense N
is O
coming O
from O
. O

While O
this O
is O
a O
far O
cry N
from O
revealing O
to O
us H
what O
we H
ought O
to O
do O
, O
the O
research N
program N
seems O
full O
of O
promise N
nonetheless O
. O

Once O
we H
get O
into O
the O
details N
, O
we H
can O
see O
that O
it O
also O
raises O
deep O
theoretical O
questions N
about O
evolutionary O
explanations N
, O
the O
relation N
of O
descriptive O
and O
normative O
claims N
, O
the O
epistemology N
of O
justification N
and O
truth N
, O
and O
the O
general O
viability N
of O
naturalism N
in O
ethics N
. O

Much O
left O
to O
wonder O
, O
then O
, O
but O
with O
some O
ideas N
about O
where O
to O
get O
our H
answers N
. O

The O
Motivated O
Learner H

Questions N
to O
consider O
: O

How O
do O
different O
types N
of O
motivation N
affect O
my H
learning O
? O

What O
is O
resilience N
and O
grit N
? O

How O
can O
I H
apply O
the O
Uses O
and O
Gratification O
Theory O
to O
make O
decisions N
about O
my H
learning O
? O

How O
do O
I H
prevent O
negative O
bias N
from O
hindering O
learning O
? O

In O
this O
section N
, O
you H
will O
continue O
to O
increase O
your H
ability N
as O
an O
informed O
learner H
. O

Here O
you H
will O
explore O
how O
much O
of O
an O
influence N
motivation N
has O
on O
learning O
, O
as O
well O
as O
how O
to O
use H
motivation N
to O
purposefully O
take O
an O
active O
role N
in O
any O
learning O
activity N
. O

Rather H
than O
passively O
attempting O
to O
absorb O
new O
information N
, O
you H
will O
learn O
how O
to O
make O
conscious O
decisions N
about O
the O
methods N
of O
learning O
you H
will O
use H
( O
based O
on O
what O
you H
intend O
to O
do O
with O
the O
information N
) O
, O
how O
you H
will O
select O
and O
use H
learning O
materials N
that O
are O
appropriate O
for O
your H
needs N
, O
and O
how O
persistent O
you H
will O
be O
in O
the O
learning O
activity N
. O

There O
are O
three O
main O
motivation N
concepts N
that O
have O
been O
found O
to O
directly O
relate O
to O
learning O
. O

Each O
of O
these O
has O
been O
proven O
to O
mean O
the O
difference N
between O
success N
and O
failure N
. O

You H
will O
find O
that O
each O
of O
these O
is O
a O
strong O
tool N
that O
will O
enable O
you H
to O
engage O
with O
learning O
material O
in O
a O
way N
that O
not O
only O
suits N
your H
needs N
, O
but O
also O
gives O
you H
ownership N
over O
your H
own O
learning O
processes N
. O

Resilience N
and O
Grit N

While O
much O
of O
this O
chapter N
will O
cover O
very O
specific O
aspects N
about O
the O
act N
of O
learning O
, O
in O
this O
section N
, O
we H
will O
present N
different O
information N
that O
may O
at O
first O
seem O
unrelated O
. O

Some O
people N
would O
consider O
it O
more O
of O
a O
personal O
outlook N
than O
a O
learning O
practice O
, O
and O
yet O
it O
has O
a O
significant O
influence N
on O
the O
ability N
to O
learn O
. O

What O
we H
are O
talking O
about O
here O
is O
called O
grit N
or O
resilience N
. O

Grit N
can O
be O
defined O
as O
personal O
perseverance N
toward O
a O
task N
or O
goal N
. O

In O
learning O
, O
it O
can O
be O
thought O
of O
as O
a O
trait N
that O
drives O
a O
person H
to O
keep O
trying O
until O
they O
succeed O
. O

It O
is O
not O
tied O
to O
talent N
or O
ability N
, O
but O
is O
simply O
a O
tendency N
to O
not O
give O
up O
until O
something O
is O
finished O
or O
accomplished O
. O

Applying O
Grit N

The O
concept N
of O
grit N
is O
an O
easy O
one N
to O
dismiss O
as O
something O
taken O
for O
granted O
. O

In O
our H
culture N
, O
we H
have O
a O
number N
of O
sayings N
and O
aphorisms N
that O
capture O
the O
essence N
of O
grit N
: O
“ O
If O
at O
first O
you H
do O
not O
succeed O
, O
try O
, O
try O
again O
, O
” O
or O
the O
famous O
quote N
by O
Thomas H
Edison H
: O
“ O
Genius H
is O
one N
percent N
inspiration N
, O
ninety O
- O
nine O
percent N
perspiration N
. O
” O

The O
problem N
is O
we H
all O
understand O
the O
concept N
, O
but O
actually O
applying O
it O
takes O
work N
. O

If O
the O
task N
we H
are O
trying O
to O
complete O
is O
a O
difficult O
one N
, O
it O
can O
take O
a O
lot N
of O
work N
. O

The O
first O
step O
in O
applying O
grit N
is O
to O
adopt O
an O
attitude N
that O
looks O
directly O
to O
the O
end N
goal N
as O
the O
only O
acceptable O
outcome N
. O

With O
this O
attitude N
comes O
an O
acceptance N
that O
you H
may O
not O
succeed O
on O
the O
first O
attempt N
— O
or O
the O
nineteenth O
attempt N
. O

Failed O
attempts N
are O
viewed O
as O
merely O
part N
of O
the O
process N
and O
seen O
as O
a O
very O
useful O
way N
to O
gain O
knowledge N
that O
moves O
you H
toward O
success N
. O

An O
example N
of O
this O
would O
be O
studying O
for O
an O
exam N
. O

In O
your H
first O
attempt N
at O
studying O
you H
simply O
reread O
the O
chapters N
of O
your H
textbook N
covered O
in O
the O
exam N
. O

You H
find O
that O
while O
this O
reinforces O
some O
of O
the O
knowledge N
you H
have O
gained O
, O
it O
does O
not O
ensure O
you H
have O
all O
the O
information N
you H
will O
need O
to O
do O
well O
on O
the O
test N
. O

You H
know O
that O
if O
you H
simply O
read O
the O
chapters N
yet O
again O
, O
there O
is O
no O
guarantee N
you H
are O
going O
to O
be O
any O
more O
successful O
. O

You H
determine O
that O
you H
need O
to O
find O
a O
different O
approach N
. O

In O
other O
words N
, O
your H
first O
attempt N
was O
not O
a O
complete O
failure N
, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
achieve O
the O
end N
goal N
, O
so O
you H
try O
again O
with O
a O
different O
method N
. O

On O
your H
second N
try O
, O
you H
copy N
down O
all O
of O
the O
main O
points O
onto O
a O
piece N
of O
paper N
using O
the O
section N
headlines N
from O
the O
chapters N
. O

After O
a O
short O
break O
you H
come O
back O
to O
your H
list N
and O
write O
down O
a O
summary N
of O
what O
you H
know O
about O
each O
item N
on O
your H
list N
. O

This O
accomplishes O
two O
things N
: O
first O
, O
you H
are O
able O
to O
immediately O
spot N
areas N
where O
you H
need O
to O
learn O
more O
, O
and O
second N
, O
you H
can O
check O
your H
summaries N
against O
the O
text N
to O
make O
certain O
what O
you H
know O
is O
correct O
and O
adequate O
. O

In O
this O
example N
, O
while O
you H
may O
not O
have O
yet O
achieved O
complete O
success N
, O
you H
will O
have O
learned O
what O
you H
need O
to O
do O
next O
. O

In O
true O
grit N
fashion N
, O
for O
your H
next O
try O
, O
you H
study O
those O
items N
on O
your H
list N
where O
you H
found O
you H
needed O
a O
bit N
more O
information N
, O
and O
then O
you H
go O
through O
your H
list N
again O
. O

This O
time N
you H
are O
able O
to O
write O
down O
summaries N
of O
all O
the O
important O
points O
, O
and O
you H
are O
confident O
you H
have O
the O
knowledge N
you H
need O
to O
do O
well O
on O
the O
exam N
. O

After O
this O
, O
you H
still O
do O
not O
stop N
, O
but O
instead O
you H
change O
your H
approach N
to O
use H
other O
methods N
that O
keep O
what O
you H
have O
learned O
fresh O
in O
your H
mind N
. O

Some O
scholars H
believe O
that O
between O
nine O
and O
fifteen O
thousand O
years N
ago O
, O
a O
land O
bridge N
existed O
between O
Asia O
and O
North H
America O
that O
we H
now O
call O
Beringia O
. O

The O
first O
inhabitants H
of O
what O
would O
be O
named O
the O
Americas O
migrated O
across O
this O
bridge N
in O
search N
of O
food N
. O

When O
the O
glaciers N
melted O
, O
water N
engulfed O
Beringia O
, O
and O
the O
Bering O
Strait O
was O
formed O
. O

Later O
settlers H
came O
by O
boat N
across O
the O
narrow O
strait N
. O

( O
The O
fact N
that O
Asians O
and O
American O
Indians H
share O
genetic O
markers N
on O
a O
Y O
chromosome N
lends O
credibility N
to O
this O
migration N
theory N
. O
) O

Continually O
moving O
southward O
, O
the O
settlers H
eventually O
populated O
both O
North H
and O
South O
America O
, O
creating O
unique O
cultures N
that O
ranged O
from O
the O
highly O
complex O
and O
urban O
Aztec O
civilization N
in O
what O
is O
now O
Mexico O
City N
to O
the O
woodland N
tribes N
of O
eastern O
North H
America O
. O

Recent O
research N
along O
the O
west O
coast N
of O
South O
America O
suggests O
that O
migrant O
populations N
may O
have O
traveled O
down O
this O
coast N
by O
water N
as O
well O
as O
by O
land O
. O

Researchers H
believe O
that O
about O
ten O
thousand O
years N
ago O
, O
humans A
also O
began O
the O
domestication N
of O
plants A
and O
animals A
, O
adding O
agriculture N
as O
a O
means N
of O
sustenance N
to O
hunting N
and O
gathering N
techniques N
. O

With O
this O
agricultural O
revolution N

and O
the O
more O
abundant O
and O
reliable O
food N

it O
brought O
, O

people N
were O
able O
to O
develop O
a O
more O

way N

In O
South O
America O
, O
early O
civilizations N
developed O
along O
the O

the O
high O

Mesoamerica O
is O
the O
geographic O
area N
stretching O
from O
north O
of O
Panama O
up O
to O
the O
desert N
of O
central O
Mexico O
. O

Although O
marked O
by O
great O
topographic O
, O
linguistic O
, O
and O
cultural O
diversity N
, O
this O
region N
cradled O
a O
number N
of O
civilizations N
with O
similar O
characteristics N
. O

Mesoamericans O
were O
polytheistic O
; O
their O
gods A
possessed O
both O
male O
and O
female O
traits N
and O
demanded O
blood N
sacrifices N
of O
enemies H
taken O
in O
battle N
or O
ritual N
bloodletting N
. O

Corn N
, O
or O
maize A
, O
domesticated O
by O
5000 O
BCE O
, O
formed O
the O
basis N
of O
their O
diet N
. O

They O
developed O
a O
mathematical O
system N
, O
built O
huge O
edifices N
, O
and O
devised O
a O
calendar N
that O
accurately O
predicted O
eclipses N
and O
solstices N
and O
that O
priest H
- O
astronomers H
used O
to O
direct O
the O
planting N
and O
harvesting N
of O
crops N

Most O
important O
for O
our H
knowledge N
of O
these O
peoples N
, O
they O
created O
the O
only O
known O

in O
the O
Western O

; O
researchers H
have O
made O
much O
progress N
in O
interpreting O
the O
inscriptions N
on O
their O
temples N
and O
pyramids N
. O

Though O
the O
area N
had O
no O
overarching O
political O
structure N
, O
trade N
over O
long O
distances N
helped O
diffuse O
culture N

The O
mother H
of O
Mesoamerican O
cultures N
was O
the O
Olmec O
civilization N
. O

Flourishing O
along O
the O
hot O
Gulf O
Coast O
of O
Mexico O
from O
about O
1200 O
to O
about O
400 O
BCE O
, O
the O
Olmec O
produced O
a O
number N
of O
major O
works O
of O
art N
, O
architecture N
, O
pottery N
, O
and O
sculpture N
. O

Most O
recognizable O
are O
their O
giant A
head N
sculptures N
( O
Figure O

) O
and O
the O
pyramid N
in O
La O
Venta O
. O

The O
Olmec O
built O
aqueducts N
to O
transport N
water N
into O
their O
cities N
and O
irrigate O
their O
fields N
. O

They O
grew O
maize A
, O
squash N
, O
beans N
, O
and O
tomatoes N

They O
also O
bred O
small O
domesticated O
dogs A
which O
, O
along O

provided O
their O
protein N

Although O
no O
one N
knows O
what O
happened O
to O
the O
Olmec O
after O
about O
400 O
BCE O
, O
in O
part N
because O
the O
jungle N
reclaimed O
many O
of O
their O
cities N
, O
their O
culture N
was O
the O
base N
upon O
which O
the O
Maya O
and O
the O
Aztec O
built O
. O

It O
was O
the O
Olmec O
who O
worshipped O
a O
rain N
god A
, O
a O
maize A
god A
, O
and O
the O
feathered O
serpent A
so O
important O
in O
the O
future N
pantheons N
of O
the O
Aztecs O
( O
who O
called O
him O
Quetzalcoatl O
) O
and O
the O
Maya O
( O
to O
whom O
he O
was O
Kukulkan O
) O
. O

The O
Olmec O
also O
developed O
a O
system N
of O
trade N
throughout O
Mesoamerica O
, O
giving O
rise N
to O
an O
elite O
class N
. O

The O

it O
was O
a O
multiethnic O

Large O
- O
scale N

the O

Ethnocentrism N

Cultural O
Relativism N

Despite O
how O
much O
humans A
have O
in O
common O
, O
cultural O
differences N
are O
far O
more O
prevalent O
than O
cultural O
universals N
. O

For O
example N
, O
while O
all O
cultures N
have O
language N
, O
analysis N
of O
particular O
language N
structures N
and O
conversational O
etiquette N
reveal O
tremendous O
differences N
. O

In O
some O
Middle O
Eastern O
cultures N
, O
it O
is O
common O
to O
stand O
close O
to O
others O
in O
conversation N
. O

North H
Americans O
keep O
more O
distance N
and O
maintain O
a O
large O
“ O
personal O
space N
. O
” O

Even O
something O
as O
simple O
as O
eating O
and O
drinking O
varies O
greatly O
from O
culture N
to O
culture N
. O

If O
your H
professor H
comes O
into O
an O
early O
morning N
class N
holding O
a O
mug N
of O
liquid N
, O
what O
do O
you H
assume O
she O
is O
drinking O
? O

In O
the O
United O

, O
it’s O
it O

most O

The O
way N

vary O
across O
cultures N
fascinates O
many O
people N

Some O
travelers H
pride N
themselves O
on O
their O
willingness N

try O
unfamiliar O

like O

, O
while O

Often O
, O
people N
in O
the O
United O

express O
disgust N
at O
other O
cultures’ O
cultures N

cuisine N
and O
think O
that O
it’s O
it O
’s H
gross O
to O
eat O
meat N
from O
a O
dog A
or O
guinea N
pig A
, O
for O
example N
, O
while O
they O
don’t O
do O
n’t O
question N
their O
own O
habit N
of O
eating O
cows A
or O
pigs A
. O

Such O
attitudes N
are O
an O
example N
of O
ethnocentrism N
, O
or O
evaluating O
and O
judging O
another O
culture N
based O
on O
how O
it O
compares O
to O
one’s O
one N

own O
cultural O
norms N
. O

Ethnocentrism N
, O
as O
sociologist H
William H
Graham H
Sumner H
( O
1906 O
) O
described O
the O
term N
, O
involves O
a O
belief N
or O
attitude N
that O
one’s O
one N
’s H
own O
culture N
is O
better O
than O
all O
others O
. O

Almost O
everyone O
is O
a O
little O
bit N
ethnocentric O
. O

For O
example N
, O
Americans O
tend O
to O
say O
that O
people N
from O
England O
drive O
on O
the O
“ O
wrong O
” O
side N
of O
the O
road N
, O
rather O
than O
on O
the O
“ O
other O
” O
side N
. O

Someone O
from O
a O
country N
where O
dog A
meat N
is O
standard O
fare N
might O
find O
it O
off O
- O
putting O
to O
see O
a O
dog A
in O
a O
French O
restaurant N
— O
not O
on O
the O
menu N
, O
but O
as O
a O
pet A
and O
patron’s O
patron H
’s H
companion H
. O

A H
good O
example N
of O
ethnocentrism N
is O
referring O
to O
parts N

Asia O
as O
the O
" O

One O
might O
question N

A H
high O
level N
of O
appreciation N
for O
one’s O
one N

culture N
can O
be O
healthy O
; O
a O
shared O
sense N
of O
community N
pride N
, O
for O
example N
, O
connects O
people N
in O
a O
society N
. O

But O
ethnocentrism N
can O
lead O
to O
disdain N
or O
dislike N
for O
other O
cultures N
and O
could O
cause N
misunderstanding N
and O
conflict N
. O

People N
with O
the O
best O
intentions N
sometimes O
travel O
to O
a O
society N
to O
“ O
help O
” O
its O
people N
, O
because O
they O
see O
them O
as O
uneducated O
or O
backward O
- O
essentially O
inferior O
. O

In O
reality N
, O
these O
travelers H
are O
guilty O
of O
cultural O
imperialism N
, O
the O
deliberate O
imposition N
of O
one’s O
one N
’s H
own O
cultural O
values N
on O
another O
culture N
. O

Europe’s O
Europe O
’s H
colonial O
expansion N
, O
begun O
in O
the O
sixteenth O
century N
, O
was O
often O
accompanied O
by O
a O
severe O
cultural O
imperialism N
. O

European O
colonizers H
often O
viewed O
the O
people N
in O
the O
lands N
they O
colonized O
as O
uncultured O
savages H
who O
were O
in O
need O
of O
European O
governance N
, O
dress O
, O
religion N
, O
and O
other O
cultural O
practices N

A H
more O
modern O
example N
of O
cultural O
imperialism N
may O
include O
the O
work N
of O
international O
aid N
agencies N
who O
introduce O
agricultural O
methods N

plant A
species A
from O

countries N
while O
overlooking O
indigenous O
varieties N
and O
agricultural O
approaches O
that O
are O
better O
suited O
to O
the O

region N
. O

Ethnocentrism N
can O
be O
so O
strong O
that O
when O
confronted O
with O
all O
of O
the O
differences N
of O
a O
new O
culture N
, O
one N
may O
experience N
disorientation N
and O
frustration N
. O

In O
sociology N
, O
we H
call O
this O
culture N
shock N
. O

A H
traveler H
from O
Chicago O
might O
find O
the O
nightly O
silence N
of O
rural O
Montana O
unsettling O
, O
not O
peaceful O
. O

An O
exchange O
student H
from O
China O
might O
be O
annoyed O
by O
the O
constant O
interruptions N
in O
class N
as O
other O
students H
ask O
questions N
— O
a O
practice O
that O
is O
considered O
rude O
in O
China O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
Chicago O
traveler H
was O
initially O
captivated O
with O
Montana’s O
Montana O
’s H
quiet N
beauty N
and O
the O
Chinese O
student H
was O
originally O
excited O
to O
see O
a O
U.S. O
- O
style N
classroom N
firsthand O
. O

But O
as O
they O
experience N
unanticipated O
differences N
from O
their O
own O
culture N
, O
their O
excitement N
gives O
way N
to O
discomfort N
and O
doubts N
about O
how O
to O
behave O
appropriately O
in O
the O
new O
situation N
. O

Eventually O
, O
as O
people N
learn O
more O
about O
a O
culture N
, O
they O
recover O
from O
culture N
shock N
. O

Culture N
shock N
may O
appear O
because O
people N
aren’t O
are O
n’t O
always O
expecting O
cultural O
differences N
. O

Anthropologist H
Ken H
Barger O
( O
1971 O
) O
discovered O
this O
when O
he O
conducted O
a O
participatory O
observation N
in O
an O
Inuit O
community N
in O
the O
Canadian O
Arctic O
. O

Originally O
from O
Indiana O
, O
Barger O
hesitated O
when O
invited O
to O
join O
a O
local O
snowshoe N
race N
. O

He O
knew O
he’d O
he O
’d O
never O
hold O
his O
own O
against O
these O
experts H
. O

Sure O
enough O
, O
he O
finished O
last O
, O
to O
his O
mortification N
. O

But O
the O
tribal O
members H
congratulated O
him O
, O
saying O
, O
“ O
You H
really O
tried O
! O
” O

In O
Barger’s O
Barger O
’s H
own O
culture N
, O
he O
had O
learned O
to O
value N
victory N
. O

To H
the O
Inuit O
people N
, O
winning O
was O
enjoyable O
, O
but O
their O
culture N
valued O
survival N
skills N
essential O
to O
their O
environment N
: O
how O
hard O
someone H
tried O
could O
mean O
the O
difference N
between O
life N
and O
death N
. O

Over O
the O
course N
of O
his O
stay O
, O
Barger O
participated O
in O
caribou A
hunts N
, O
learned O
how O
to O
take O
shelter N
in O
winter N
storms N
, O
and O
sometimes O
went O
days N
with O
little O
or O
no O
food N
to O
share O
among O
tribal O
members H
. O

Trying O
hard O
and O
working O
together O
, O
two O
nonmaterial O
values N
, O
were O
indeed O
much O
more O
important O
than O
winning O
. O

During O
his O
time N
with O
the O
Inuit O
tribe N
, O
Barger O
learned O
to O
engage O
in O
cultural O
relativism N
. O

Cultural O
relativism N
is O
the O
practice O
of O
assessing O
a O
culture N
by O
its O
own O
standards N
rather O
than O
viewing O
it O
through O
the O
lens N
of O
one’s O
one N
’s H
own O
culture N
. O

Practicing O
cultural O
relativism N
requires O
an O
open O
mind N
and O
a O
willingness N
to O
consider O
, O
and O
even O
adapt O
to O
, O
new O
values N
and O
norms N
. O

However O
, O
indiscriminately O
embracing O
everything O
about O
a O
new O
culture N
is O
not O
always O
possible O
. O

Even O
the O
most O
culturally O
relativist O
people N
from O
egalitarian O
societies N
— O
ones N
in O
which O
women H
have O
political O
rights N
and O
control N
over O
their O
own O
bodies N
— O
would O
question N
whether O
the O
widespread O
practice O
of O
female O
genital O
mutilation N
in O
countries N
such O
as O
Ethiopia O
and O
Sudan O
should O
be O
accepted O
as O
a O
part N
of O
cultural O
tradition N
. O

Sociologists H
attempting O
to O
engage O
in O
cultural O
relativism N
, O
then O
, O
may O
struggle O
to O
reconcile O
aspects N
of O
their O
own O
culture N
with O
aspects N
of O
a O
culture N
that O
they O
are O
studying O
. O

Sometimes O
when O
people N
attempt N
to O
rectify O
feelings N
of O
ethnocentrism N
and O
develop O
cultural O
relativism N
, O
they O
swing O
too O
far O
to O
the O
other O
end N
of O
the O
spectrum N
. O

Xenocentrism O
is O
the O
opposite N
of O
ethnocentrism N
, O
and O
refers O
to O
the O
belief N
that O
another O
culture N
is O
superior O
to O
one’s O
one N
’s H
own O
. O

( O
The O
Greek O
root N
word N
xeno O
, O
pronounced O
“ O
ZEE-no O
, O
” O
means N
“ O
stranger H

who O
goes O
home N
after O
a O

a O
sociologist H

find O
it O

LEARNING N
OBJECTIVES N

By O
the O
end N
of O
this O
section N
, O
you H
will O
be O
able O
to O
: O

Describe O
Einstein’s O
Einstein H
’s H
view N
of O
gravity N
as O
the O
warping N
of O
spacetime O
in O
the O
presence N
of O
massive O
objects N

Understand O
that O
Newton’s O
Newton H
’s H
concept N
of O
the O
gravitational O
force N
between O
two O
massive O
objects N
and O
Einstein’s O
Einstein H
’s H
concept N
of O
warped O
spacetime O
are O
different O
explanations N
for O
the O
same O
observed O
accelerations N
of O
one N
massive O
object N
in O
the O
presence N
of O
another O
massive O
object N

Is O
light N
actually O
bent O
from O
its O
straight O
- O
line N
path N
by O
the O
mass O
of O
Earth O
? O

How O
can O
light N
, O
which O
has O
no O
mass O
, O
be O
affected O
by O
gravity N
? O

Einstein H
preferred O
to O
think O
that O
it O
is O
space N
and O
time N
that O
are O
affected O
by O
the O
presence N
of O
a O
large O
mass O
; O
light N
beams N
, O
and O
everything O
else O
that O
travels O
through O
space N
and O
time N
, O
then O
find O
their O
paths N
affected O
. O

Light O
always O
follows O
the O
shortest O
path N
— O
but O
that O
path N
may O
not O
always O
be O
straight O
. O

This O
idea N
is O
true O
for O
human O
travel O
on O
the O
curved O
surface N
of O
planet N
Earth O
, O
as O
well O
. O

Say O
you H
want O
to O
fly O
from O
Chicago O
to O
Rome O
. O

Since O
an O
airplane N
can’t O
ca O
n’t O
go O
through O
the O
solid N
body N
of O
the O
Earth O
, O
the O
shortest O
distance N
is O
not O
a O
straight O
line N
but O
the O
arc N
of O
a O
great O
circle N
. O

Linkages N
: O
Mass N
, O
Space N
, O
and O
Time N

To H
show O
what O
Einstein’s O
Einstein H
’s H
insight N
really O
means N
, O
let’s O
let O
’s H
first O
consider O
how O
we H
locate O
an O
event N
in O
space N
and O
time N
. O

For O
example N
, O
imagine O
you H
have O
to O
describe O
to O
worried O
school N
officials O
the O
fire N
that O
broke O
out H
in O
your H
room N
when O
your H
roommate H
tried O
cooking O
shish O
kebabs N
in O
the O
fireplace N
. O

You H
explain O
that O
your H
dorm N
is O
at O
6400 O
College N
Avenue O
, O
a O
street N
that O
runs O
in O
the O
left O
- O
right O
direction N
on O
a O
map N
of O
your H
town N
; O
you H
are O
on O
the O
fifth O
floor N
, O
which O
tells O
where O
you H
are O
in O
the O
up O
- O
down O
direction N
; O
and O
you H
are O
the O
sixth O
room N
back O
from O
the O
elevator N
, O
which O
tells O
where O
you H
are O
in O
the O
forward O
- O
backward O
direction N
. O

Then O
you H
explain O
that O
the O
fire N
broke O
out H
at O
6:23 O
p.m. O
( O
but O
was O
soon O
brought O
under O
control N
) O
, O
which O
specifies O
the O
event N
in O
time N
. O

Any O
event N
in O
the O
universe N
, O
whether O
nearby O
or O
far O
away O
, O
can O
be O
pinpointed O
using O
the O
three O
dimensions N
of O
space N
and O
the O
one N
dimension N
of O
time N
. O

Newton H
considered O
space N
and O
time N
to O
be O
completely O
independent O
, O
and O
that O
continued O
to O
be O
the O
accepted O
view N
until O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
twentieth O
century N
. O

But O
Einstein H
showed O
that O
there O
is O
an O
intimate O
connection N
between O
space N
and O
time N
, O
and O
that O
only O
by O
considering O
the O
two O
together O
— O
in O
what O
we H
call O
spacetime O
— O
can O
we H
build O
up O
a O
correct O
picture N
of O
the O
physical O
world N
. O

We H
examine O
spacetime O
a O
bit N
more O
closely O
in O
the O
next O
subsection N
. O

The O
gist N
of O
Einstein’s O
Einstein H
’s H
general O
theory N
is O
that O
the O
presence N
of O
matter N
curves O
or O
warps O
the O
fabric N
of O
spacetime O
. O

This O
curving O
of O
spacetime O
is O
identified O
with O
gravity N
. O

When O
something O
else O
— O
a O
beam N
of O
light N
, O
an O
electron N
, O
or O
the O
starship O
Enterprise O
— O
enters O
such O
a O
region N
of O
distorted O
spacetime O
, O
its O
path N
will O
be O
different O
from O
what O
it O
would O
have O
been O
in O
the O
absence N
of O
the O
matter N
. O

As O
American O
physicist H
John H
Wheeler H
summarized O
it O
: O
“ O
Matter N
tells O
spacetime O
how O
to O
curve O
; O
spacetime O
tells O
matter N
how O
to O
move O
. O
” O

The O
amount N
of O
distortion N
in O
spacetime O
depends O
on O
the O
mass O
of O
material O
that O
is O
involved O
and O
on O
how O
concentrated O
and O
compact O
it O
is O
. O

Terrestrial O
objects N
, O
such O
as O
the O
book O
you H
are O
reading O
, O
have O
far O
too O
little O
mass O
to O
introduce O
any O
significant O
distortion N
. O

Newton’s O
Newton H
’s H
view N
of O
gravity N
is O
just O
fine O
for O
building N
bridges N
, O
skyscrapers N
, O
or O
amusement N
park N
rides N
. O

General O
relativity N
does O
, O
however O
, O
have O
some O
practical O
applications N
. O

The O
GPS N
( O
Global O
Positioning O
System O
) O
in O
every O
smartphone O
can O
tell O
you H
where O
you H
are O
within O
5 O
to O
10 O
meters N
only O
because O
the O
effects N
of O
general O
and O
special O
relativity N
on O
the O
GPS N
satellites N
in O
orbit N
around O
the O
Earth O
are O
taken O
into O
account O
. O

Unlike O
a O
book O
or O
your H
roommate H
, O
stars N
produce O
measurable O
distortions N
in O
spacetime O
. O

A H
white O
dwarf H
, O
with O
its O
stronger O
surface N
gravity N
, O
produces O
more O
distortion N
just O
above O
its O
surface N
than O
does O
a O
red O
giant A
with O
the O
same O
mass O
. O

So O
, O
you H
see O
, O
we H
are O
eventually O
going O
to O
talk O
about O
collapsing O
stars N
again O
, O
but O
not O
before O
discussing O
Einstein’s O
Einstein H
’s H
ideas N
( O
and O
the O
evidence N
for O
them O
) O
in O
more O
detail N
. O

Spacetime O
Examples N

How O
can O
we H
understand O
the O
distortion N
of O
spacetime O
by O
the O
presence N
of O
some O
( O
significant O
) O
amount N
of O
mass O
? O

Let’s O
Let O
’s H
try O
the O
following O
analogy N
. O

You H
may O
have O
seen O
maps N
of O
New H
York H
City N
that O
squeeze O
the O
full O
three O
dimensions N
of O
this O
towering O
metropolis N
onto O
a O
flat O
sheet N
of O
paper N
and O
still O
have O
enough O
information N
so O
tourists H
will O
not O
get O
lost O
. O

Let’s O
Let O
’s H
do O
something O
similar O
with O
diagrams N
of O
spacetime O
. O

Figure O
24.7 O
, O
for O
example N
, O
shows N
the O
progress N
of O
a O
motorist H
driving O
east O
on O
a O
stretch O
of O
road N
in O
Kansas O
where O
the O
countryside N
is O
absolutely O
flat O
. O

Since O
our H
motorist H
is O
traveling O
only O
in O
the O
east O
- O
west O
direction N
and O
the O
terrain N
is O
flat O
, O
we H
can O
ignore O
the O
other O
two O
dimensions N
of O
space N
. O

The O
amount N
of O
time N
elapsed O
since O
he O
left O
home N
is O
shown O
on O
the O
y N
- O
axis N
, O
and O
the O
distance N
traveled O
eastward O
is O
shown O
on O
the O
x O
- O
axis N
. O

From O
A H
to O
B H
he O
drove O
at O
a O
uniform N
speed N
; O
unfortunately O
, O
it O
was O
too O
fast O
a O
uniform N
speed N
and O
a O
police N
car N
spotted O
him O
. O

From O
B H
to O
C N
he O
stopped O
to O
receive O
his O
ticket N
and O
made O
no O
progress N
through O
space N
, O
only O
through O
time N
. O

From O
C N
to O
D H
he O
drove O
more O
slowly O
because O
the O
police N
car N
was O
behind O
him O
. O

Figure O

Spacetime O
Diagram N
. O

This O
diagram N
shows N
the O
progress N
of O
a O
motorist H
traveling O
east O
across O
the O
flat O
Kansas O
landscape N
. O

Distance N
traveled O
is O
plotted O
along O
the O
horizontal O
axis N
. O

The O
time N
elapsed O
since O
the O
motorist H
left O
the O
starting O
point N
is O
plotted O
along O
the O
vertical O
axis N
. O

Now O
let’s O
let O
’s H
try O
illustrating O
the O
distortions N
of O
spacetime O
in O
two O
dimensions N
. O

In O
this O
case N
, O
we H
will O
( O
in O
our H
imaginations N
) O
use H
a O
rubber N
sheet N
that O
can O
stretch O
or O
warp O
if O
we H
put O
objects N
on O
it O
. O

Let’s O
Let O
’s H
imagine O
stretching O
our H
rubber N
sheet N
taut O
on O
four O
posts N
. O

To H
complete O
the O
analogy N
, O
we H
need O
something O
that O
normally O
travels O
in O
a O
straight O
line N
( O
as O
light N
does O
) O
. O

Suppose O
we H
have O
an O
extremely O
intelligent O
ant O
— O
a O
friend H
of O
the O
comic O
book O
superhero O
Ant O
- O
Man H
, O
perhaps O
— O
that O
has O
been O
trained O
to O
walk O
in O
a O
straight O
line N
. O

We H
begin O
with O
just O
the O
rubber N
sheet N
and O
the O
ant O
, O
simulating O
empty O
space N
with O
no O
mass O
in O
it O
. O

We H
put O
the O
ant O
on O
one N
side N
of O
the O
sheet N
and O
it O
walks O
in O
a O
beautiful O
straight O
line N
over O
to O
the O
other O
side N
( O
Figure O
24.8 O
) O
. O

We H
next O
put O
a O
small O
grain N
of O
sand N
on O
the O
rubber N
sheet N
. O

The O
sand N
does O
distort O
the O
sheet N
a O
tiny O
bit N
, O
but O
this O
is O
not O
a O
distortion N
that O
we H
or O
the O
ant O
can O
measure N
. O

If O
we H
send O
the O
ant O
so O
it O
goes O
close O
to O
, O
but O
not O
on O
top N
of O
, O
the O
sand N
grain N
, O
it O
has O
little O
trouble N
continuing O
to O
walk O
in O
a O
straight O
line N
. O

Now O
we H
grab O
something O
with O
a O
little O
more O
mass O
— O
say O
, O
a O
small O
pebble N
. O

It O
bends O
or O
distorts O
the O
sheet N
just O
a O
bit N
around O
its O
position N
. O

If O
we H
send O
the O
ant O
into O
this O
region N
, O
it O
finds O
its O
path N
slightly O
altered O
by O
the O
distortion N
of O
the O
sheet N
. O

The O
distortion N
is O
not O
large O
, O
but O
if O
we H
follow O
the O
ant’s O
ant O
’s H
path N
carefully O
, O
we H
notice O
it O
deviating O
slightly O
from O
a O
straight O
line N
. O

The O
effect N
gets O
more O
noticeable O
as O
we H
increase O
the O
mass O
of O
the O
object N
that O
we H
put O
on O
the O
sheet N
. O

Let’s O
Let O
’s H
say O
we H
now O
use H
a O
massive O
paperweight N
. O

Such O
a O
heavy O
object N
distorts O
or O
warps O
the O
rubber N
sheet N
very O
effectively O
, O
putting O
a O
good O
sag N
in O
it O
. O

From O
our H
point N
of O
view N
, O
we H
can O
see O
that O
the O
sheet N
near O
the O
paperweight N
is O
no O
longer O
straight O
. O

2.3 O
Measures N
of O
the O
Location N
of O
the O
Data N

The O
common O
measures N
of O
location N
are O
quartiles N
and O
percentiles N
. O

Quartiles N
are O
special O
percentiles N
. O

The O
first O
quartile N
, O
Q O
1 O
, O
is O
the O
same O
as O
the O
25th O
percentile N
, O
and O
the O
third O
quartile N
, O
Q O
3 O
, O
is O
the O
same O
as O
the O
75th O
percentile N
. O

The O
median N
, O
M N
, O
is O
called O
both O
the O
second N
quartile N
and O
the O
50th O
percentile N
. O

To H
calculate O
quartiles N
and O
percentiles N
, O
you H
must O
order O
the O
data N
from O
smallest O
to O
largest O
. O

Quartiles N
divide O
ordered O
data N
into O
quarters N
. O

Percentiles N
divide O
ordered O
data N
into O
hundredths N
. O

Recall O
that O
a O
percent N
means N
one N
- O
hundredth O
. O

So O
, O
percentiles N
mean O
the O
data N
is O
divided O
into O
100 O
sections N
. O

To H
score N
in O
the O
90th O
percentile N
of O
an O
exam N
does O
not O
mean O
, O
necessarily O
, O
that O
you H
received O
90 O
percent N
on O
a O
test N
. O

It O
means N
that O
90 O
percent N
of O
test N
scores N
are O
the O
same O
as O
or O
less O
than O
your H
score N
and O
that O
10 O
percent N
of O
the O
test N
scores N
are O
the O
same O
as O
or O
greater O
than O
your H
test N
score N
. O

Percentiles N
are O
useful O
for O
comparing O
values N
. O

For O
this O
reason N
, O
universities N
and O
colleges N
use H
percentiles N
extensively O
. O

One O
instance N
in O
which O
colleges N
and O
universities N
use H
percentiles N
is O
when O
SAT O
results N
are O
used O
to O
determine O
a O
minimum O
testing O
score N
that O
will O
be O
used O
as O
an O
acceptance N
factor N
. O

For O
example N
, O
suppose O
Duke H
accepts O
SAT O
scores N
at O
or O
above O
the O
75th O
percentile N
. O

That O
translates O
into O
a O
score N
of O
at O
least O
1220 O
. O

Percentiles N
are O
mostly O
used O
with O
very O
large O
populations N
. O

Therefore O
, O
if O
you H
were O
to O
say O
that O
90 O
percent N
of O
the O
test N
scores N
are O
less O
, O
and O
not O
the O
same O
or O
less O
, O
than O
your H
score N
, O
it O
would O
be O
acceptable O
because O
removing O
one N
particular O
data N
value N
is O
not O
significant O
. O

The O
median N
is O
a O
number N
that O
measures N
the O
center N
of O
the O
data N
. O

You H
can O
think O
of O
the O
median N
as O
the O
middle O
value N
, O
but O
it O
does O
not O
actually O
have O
to O
be O
one N
of O
the O
observed O
values N
. O

It O
is O
a O
number N
that O
separates O
ordered O
data N
into O
halves N
. O

Half O
the O
values N
are O
the O
same O
number N
or O
smaller O
than O
the O
median N
, O
and O
half O
the O
values N
are O
the O
same O
number N
or O
larger O
. O

For O
example N
, O
consider O
the O
following O
data N
: O

1 O
, O
11.5 O
, O
6 O
, O
7.2 O
, O
4 O
, O
8 O
, O
9 O
, O
10 O
, O
6.8 O
, O
8.3 O
, O

Ordered O
from O
smallest O
to O

: O

, O
8 O
, O
8.3 O
, O
9 O
, O
10 O
, O
10 O
, O
11.5 O

When O
a O
data N
set O
has O
an O
even O
number N
of O
data N
values N
, O
the O
median N
is O
equal O
to O
the O
average O
of O
the O
two O
middle O
values N
when O
the O
data N
are O
arranged O
in O
ascending O
order O
( O
least O
to O
greatest O
) O
. O

When O
a O
data N
set O
has O
an O
odd O
number N
of O
data N
values N
, O
the O
median N
is O
equal O
to O
the O
middle O
value N
when O
the O
data N
are O
arranged O
in O
ascending O
order O
. O

Since O
there O
are O
14 O
observations N
( O
an O
even O
number N
of O
data N
values N
) O
, O
the O
median N
is O
between O
the O
seventh O
value N
, O
6.8 O
, O
and O
the O
eighth O
value N
, O
7.2 O
. O

To H
find O
the O
median N
, O
add O
the O
two O
values N
together O
and O
divide O
by O
two O
. O

( O
6.8 O
+ O
7.2 O
) O
/ O
2 O
= O
7 O

The O
median N
is O
seven O
. O

Half O
of O
the O
values N
are O
smaller O
than O
seven O
and O
half O
of O
the O
values N
are O
larger O
than O
seven O
. O

Quartiles N
are O
numbers N
that O
separate O
the O
data N
into O
quarters N
. O

Quartiles N
may O
or O
may O
not O
be O
part N
of O
the O
data N
. O

To H
find O
the O
quartiles N
, O
first O
find O
the O
median N
, O
or O
second N
, O
quartile N
. O

The O
first O
quartile N
, O
Q O
1 O
, O
is O
the O
middle O
value N
of O
the O
lower O
half O
of O
the O
data N
, O
and O
the O
third O
quartile N
, O
Q O
3 O
, O
is O
the O
middle O
value N
, O
or O
median N
, O
of O
the O
upper O
half O
of O
the O
data N
. O

To H
get O
the O
idea N
, O
consider O
the O
same O
data N
set O
: O

1 O
, O
1 O
, O
2 O
, O
2 O
, O
4 O
, O
6 O
, O
6.8 O
, O
7.2 O
, O
8 O
, O
8.3 O
, O
9 O
, O
10 O
, O
10 O
, O
11.5 O

The O
data N
set O
has O
an O
even O
number N
of O
values N
( O
14 O
data N
values N
) O
, O
so O
the O
median N
will O
be O
the O
average O
of O
the O
two O
middle O
values N
( O
the O
average O
of O
6.8 O
and O
7.2 O
) O
, O
which O
is O
calculated O
as O
( O
6.8 O
+ O
7.2 O
) O
/ O
2 O
and O
equals O
7 O
. O

So O
, O
the O
median N
, O
or O
second N
quartile N
( O
Q O
2 O
) O
, O
is O
7 O
. O

The O
first O
quartile N
is O
the O
median N
of O
the O
lower O
half O
of O
the O
data N
, O
so O
if O
we H
divide O
the O
data N
into O
seven O
values N
in O
the O
lower O
half O
and O
seven O
values N
in O
the O
upper O
half O
, O
we H
can O
see O
that O
we H
have O
an O
odd O
number N
of O
values N
in O
the O
lower O
half O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
median N
of O
the O
lower O
half O
, O
or O
the O
first O
quartile N
( O
Q O
1 O
) O
will O
be O
the O
middle O
value N
, O
or O
2 O
. O

Using O
the O
same O
procedure N
, O
we H
can O
see O
that O
the O
median N
of O
the O
upper O
half O
, O
or O
the O
third O
quartile N
( O
Q O
3 O
) O
will O
be O
the O
middle O
value N
of O
the O
upper O
half O
, O
or O
9 O
. O

The O

Good O
morning N
everybody O
, O
welcome O
back O
to O
another O
vlog O
. O

Today N
is O
Wednesday O
. O

I H
started O
out H
this O
vlog O
outside O
because O
I H
really O
wanted O
to O
sit O
outside O
in O
this O
like O
beautiful O
weather N
and O
talk O
to O
you H
while O
I H
was O
eating O
my H
snack N
, O
and O
like O
, O
I H
just O
finished O
filming N
a O
main O
channel N
video N
out H
there O
, O
but O
then O
my H
neighbor H
came O
outside O
and O
like O
, O
things N
got O
kind N
of O
awkward O
. O

I H
just O
feel O
awkward O
being O
like O
" O
what's O
what O
's H
up O
guys H
, O
" O
like O
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
when O
my H
neighbors H
are O
out H
in O
their O
backyard N
. O

So O
I'm O
I H
'm O
just O
gonna O
gon O
na O
let O
them O
have O
their O
peace N
and O
quiet N
, O
but O
I H
just O
finished O
my H
snack N
. O

I H
have O
a O
lot N
to O
do O
today N
. O

But O
like O
I H
said O
. O

Oh O
yes O
, O
also O
hi O
, O
pimple N
patches N
galore O
, O
so O
many O
of O
them O
. O

Are O
these O
as O
distracting O
to O
you H
as O
they O
are O
for O
me H
? O

Sorry O
, O
hi O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
me H
now O
. O

My H
face N
is O
breaking O
out H
so O
badly O
. O

I H
mentioned O
it O
in O
the O
last O
vlog O
. O

I H
think O
it's O
it O
's H
hormonal O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
like O
I H
washed O
my H
makeup N
brushes N
. O

I H
changed O
my H
pillowcases N
once O
to O
twice O
a O
week N
. O

I H
am O
like O
diligent O
, O
like O
vigilant O
even O
about O
my H
skincare N
routine N
. O

So O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
really O
know O
what's O
what O
's H
going O
on O
. O

I H
think O
it's O
it O
's H
hormonal O
, O
but O
anyways O
, O
this O
is O
just O
real O
life N
and O
I've O
I H
've O
really O
been O
struggling O
with O
my H
appearance N
lately O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
been O
a O
really O
sore O
spot N
for O
me H
. O

I H
— O
we're O
we H
're O
just O
jumping O
right O
into O
it O
, O
aren't O
are O
n't O
we H
? O

I'm O
I H
'm O
just O
being O
honest O
, O
like O
, O
I H
am O
not O
in O
a O
good O
place N
with O
the O
way N
I H
look O
. O

And O
I H
also O
think O
I H
put O
way N
too O
much O
emphasis N
on O
what O
I H
look O
like O
, O
and O
the O
fact N
that O
I'm O
I H
'm O
putting O
this O
on O
the O
internet N
and O
that O
I H
, O
like O
, O
get O
like O
this O
for O
the O
internet N
, O
is O
huge O
for O
me H
, O
it's O
it O
's H
always O
been O
huge O
for O
me H
, O
but O
also O
it's O
it O
's H
really O
hard O
when O
I'm O
I H
'm O
editing O
. O

I H
have O
a O
really O
hard O
time N
, O
like O
just O
grappling O
with O
my H
appearance N
at O
times N
, O
and O
that's O
that O
's H
a O
really O
toxic O
thing N
for O
your H
mental O
health N
. O

And O
so O
I'm O
I H
'm O
trying O
to O
break O
out H
of O
that O
, O
and O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
maybe O
some O
of O
you H
are O
also O
dealing O
with O
the O
same O
thing N
and O
are O
struggling O
with O
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
I H
just O
feel O
ugly O
. O

I H
feel O
ugly O
all O
the O
time N
. O

And O
I H
know O
that's O
that O
's H
not O
the O
case N
and O
ugly O
is O
such O
a O
subjective O
word N
. O

And O
also O
I H
feel O
like O
it's O
it O
's H
a O
word N
meant O
to O
like O
, O
oppress O
people N
, O
particularly O
women H
, O
but O
I've O
I H
've O
just O
been O
having O
a O
hard O
time N
with O
the O
way N
I H
look O
. O

Like O
my H
face N
and O
my H
hair N
, O
my H
features O
, O
the O
amount N
of O
body N
hair N
I H
have O
in O
random O
places N
because O
of O
like O
my H
hormones N
, O
my H
weight N
especially O
. O

So O
it's O
it O
's H
just O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
been O
rough O
. O

And O
I H
think O
I'm O
I H
'm O
zooming O
out H
right O
now O
in O
my H
head N
and O
realizing O
that O
it's O
it O
's H
been O
two O
, O
almost O
two O
years N
of O
this O
shit O
, O
and O
that O
I H
obviously O
need O
to O
be O
more O
gentle O
with O
myself H
and O
I H
think O
I'm O
I H
'm O
in O
the O
process N
of O
doing O
that O
, O
and O
this O
week N
, O
particularly O
I've O
I H
've O
been O
moving O
my H
body N
a O
little O
bit N
more O
and O
it's O
it O
's H
been O
feeling O
really O
good O
. O

And O
also O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
very O
proud O
to O
say O
that O
I H
have O
actually O
gone O
back O
to O
therapy N
, O
which O
is O
something O
that O
I H
haven't O
have O
n't O
done O
since O
— O
I H
mean O
the O
last O
time N
I H
was O
in O
therapy N
, O
almost O
I H
was O
like O
20 O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
33 O
. O

Your H
girl's O
girl H
's H
got O
trauma N
like O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
way N
past N
due O
. O

I H
think O
in O
the O
past N
I H
have O
really O
put O
off O
therapy N
because O
I H
wasn't O
was O
n't O
ready O
to O
like O
open O
old O
wounds N
. O

And O
it O
takes O
a O
lot N
sometimes O
when O
you're H
you H
're O
in O
therapy N
, O
like O
it O
takes O
a O
toll N
on O
you H
mentally O
. O

And O
so O
, O
I H
knew O
that O
things N
were O
gonna O
gon O
na O
have O
to O
get O
unearthed O
and O
things N
were O
definitely O
gonna O
gon O
na O
have O
to O
get O
worse O
before O
they O
got O
better O
. O

And O
I've O
I H
've O
only O
just O
started O
, O
but O
I'm O
I H
'm O
already O
feeling O
really O
good O
in O
that O
I'm O
I H
'm O
taking O
this O
step O
towards O
bettering O
myself H
and O
it O
makes O
me H
really O
happy O
. O

And O
you H
know O
, O
my H
therapist H
, O
like O
the O
very O
first O
thing N
she O
said O
was O
, O
you H
know O
, O
you H
doing O
this O
takes O
a O
lot N
of O
courage N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
like O
a O
lot N
of O
bravery N
involved O
to O
do O
something O
like O
this O
and O
to O
kind N
of O
want O
to O
better O
yourself H
and O
to O
take O
these O
steps N
for O
you H
and O
your H
mental O
health N
. O

And O
I H
was O
just O
like O
, O
wow O
, O
thanks N
. O

So O
I H
did O
bring O
that O
up O
, O
the O
whole O
thing N
I H
was O
talking O
about O
before O
in O
therapy N
, O
where O
I H
have O
a O
really O
hard O
time N
with O
my H
appearance N
. O

In O
fact N
, O
it O
becomes O
like O
an O
obsession N
and O
I H
obsess O
over O
little O
, O
every O
angle N
and O
thing N
. O

And O
it O
probably O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
seem O
that O
way N
, O
by O
the O
way N
I H
feel O
myself H
, O
but O
it's O
it O
's H
always O
just O
something O
that's O
that O
's H
in O
here O
, O
do O
you H
know O
what O
I H
mean O
? O

Conversations N
for O
first O
thing N
in O
the O
morning N
what O
the O
heck O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
even O
11:00 O
a.m. O
, O
but O
hi O
, O
just O
coming O
right O
out H
of O
the O
gate N
, O
just O
with O
what's O
what O
's H
fresh O
on O
my H
mind N
. O

I H
know O
you H
all O
appreciate O
when O
I H
have O
these O
talks N
and O
you H
know O
, O
just O
kind N
of O
like O
get O
real O
with O
you H
. O

And O
I H
mean O
, O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
get O
much O
realer O
than O
this O
. O

So O
anyways O
, O
today N
I H
have O
quite O
a O
bit N
of O
filming N
to O
do O
. O

I H
just O
filmed O
my H
like O
portion N
of O
a O
main O
channel N
video N
that O
was O
outside O
, O
that O
was O
really O
fun O
. O

I H
think O
maybe O
in O
this O
video N
, O
this O
vlog O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
just O
in O
the O
mood N
to O
talk O
, O
you H
know O
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
really O
have O
much O
to O
show O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
really O
doing O
anything O
this O
week N
other O
than O
like O
hunkering O
down O
and O
doing O
as O
much O
work N
as O
possible O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
think O
, O
maybe O
in O
the O
next O
vlog O
I H
might O
do O
some O
fall N
things N
, O
excuse O
me H
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
really O
just O
kind N
of O
preparing O
to O
go O
out H
of O
town N
next O
week N
and O
I H
have O
like O
a O
lot N
of O
deadlines N
and O
stuff N
before O
then O
. O

So O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
, O
I H
kinda O
just O
wanna O
wan O
na O
chat N
. O

But O
first O

I H
'm O
gonna O
gon O
na O
try O
not O
-- O

I'm O
I H
'm O
trying O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
trying O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
just O
being O
honest O
, O
I H
was O
just O
about O
to O
say O
we H
need O
to O
do O
something O
about O
this O
. O

I H
still O
feel O
that O
way N
, O
but O
I'm O
I H
'm O
working O
on O
it O
. O

Let's O
Let O
's H
reconvene O
after O
I've O
I H
've O
had O
a O
shower N
. O

Good O
morning N
friends H
! O

So O
I've O
I H
've O
been O
planning O
to O
vlog O
today N
um O
because O
I H
was O
going O
to O
do O
like O
a O
little O
productive O
day N
of O
my H
life N
blah O
blah O
blah O
but O
then O
I H
literally O
had O
a O
mental O
breakdown N
at O
4 O
am O
last O
night N
. O

And O
I H
was O
like O
, O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
vlog O
tomorrow N
because O
I'm O
I H
'm O
just O
not O
gonna O
gon O
na O
have O
the O
mental O
energy N
or O
the O
physical O
energy N
to O
do O
anything O
productive O
. O

Like O
I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
even O
think O
I H
would O
be O
able O
to O
wake O
up O
for O
my H
8:15 O
a.m. O
yoga N
class N
that O
I H
signed O
up O
for O
, O
but O
I H
am O
awake O
. O

So O
I H
was O
kind N
of O
like O
, O
maybe O
I H
should O
vlog O
today N
and O
just O
see O
how O
my H
day N
turns N
around O
because O
we're O
we H
're O
getting O
off O
on O
a O
rough O
start O
right O
now O
. O

But O
yeah O
, O
I H
will O
just O
take O
you H
guys H
through O
another O
day N
in O
my H
life N
. O

I'll O
I H
'll O
take O
you H
guys H
to O
yoga N
with O
me H
and O
we'll O
we H
'll O
just O
see O
if O
things N
improve O
. O

I H
have O
my H
glasses N
on O
now O
. O

Um O
today's O
today N
's H
Wednesday O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
quite O
gloomy O
out H
. O

Yeah O
, O
I H
have O
my H
usual O
co-op N
today N
. O

And O
then O
after O
that O
, O
I H
have O
my H
class N
, O
my H
marketing N
brand N
management N
class N
. O

And O
I H
have O
a O
meeting N
tonight N
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
gonna O
gon O
na O
start O
getting O
ready O
for O
my H
yoga N
class N
soon O
so O
let's O
let O
's H
start O
doing O
that O
. O

I H
got O
this O
workout N
set O
from O
Amazon O
and O
it O
is O
so O
good O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
like O
really O
thick O
and O
stretchy O
and O
comfy O
and O
soft O
. O

This O
is O
my H
fit O
for O
the O
day N
. O

I H
guess O
I've O
I H
've O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion N
that O
if O
I H
wear O
more O
workout N
clothes N
, O
like O
just O
in O
my H
daily O
life N
, O
then O
I'll O
I H
'll O
be O
more O
inclined O
to O
go O
to O
the O
gym N
because O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
like O
change O
OOTD O
haha O
. O

Alright O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
pretty O
much O
all O
ready O
to O
go O
, O
I H
just O

heading O
out H
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
actually O
very O
excited O
for O

, O
my H
name N
is O
Jasmine H
, O
and O
I'm O
I H
'm O
so O
glad O
you're H
you H
're O
here O
on O
my H
channel N
. O

If O
you H
haven't O
have O
n't O
already O
followed O
my H
social O
media N
, O
I'll O
I H
'll O
link N
it O
right O
here O
. O

My H
socials N
are O
@jasthenurse O
. O

So O
, O
if O
you H
haven't O
have O
n't O
watched O
my H
other O
video N
, O
I H
wanted O
to O
give O
you H
guys H
an O
update O
as O
to O
my H
experience N
with O
Covid O
. O

For O
those O
of O
you H
who O
hadn't O
had O
n't O
already O
watched O
that O
video N
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
gonna O
gon O
na O
link N
that O
video N
right O
here O
so O
that O
you H
can O
watch O
it O
. O

Um O
, O
so O
essentially O
, O
on O
the O
16th O
of O
December O
, O
I H
tested O
positive N
for O
Covid O
. O

If O
I'm O
I H
'm O
sounding O
out H
of O
breath N
, O
my H
lingering O
shortness N
of O
breath N
, O
and O
then O
also O
you H
know O
that O
I H
always O
talk O
fast O
in O
these O
videos N
. O

In O
this O
video N
, O
I H
wanted O
to O
update O
you H
all O
regarding O
my H
symptoms N
of O
Covid O
and O
just O
my H
overall O
experience N
with O
it O
. O

For O
one N
, O
it O
can O
make O
people N
more O
aware O
and O
then O
hopefully O
make O
people N
feel O
a O
little O
bit N
less O
alone O
. O

So O
, O
my H
first O
symptom N
, O
which O
was O
on O
Monday O
, O
was O
a O
sore O
throat N
. O

And O
the O
thing N
is O
, O
on O
Sunday O
night N
, O
I H
had O
gotten O
back O
from O
work N
around O
9:00 O
pm O
, O
so O
I H
took O
a O
shower N
. O

Um O
I H
never O
really O
dried O
my H
hair N
, O
which O
is O
so O
awful O
, O
but O
I H
decided O
to O
go O
straight O
to O
bed N
because O
I H
was O
so O
exhausted O
. O

I H
just O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
sleep O
. O

But O
I H
went O
to O
bed N
with O
my H
hair N
wet O
. O

And O
you H
know O
like O
when O
you H
wake O
up O
sometimes O
you H
have O
like O
a O
sore O
throat N
because O
of O
the O
fact N
that O
your H
hair N
was O
wet O
and O
you H
were O
cold O
? O

So O
, O
I H
assumed O
oh O
that O
like O
maybe O
it O
was O
just O
like O
a O
sore O
throat N
gotten O
because O
I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
bother O
to O
you H
know O
blow O
dry H
my H
hair N
. O

So O
, O
that O
happened O
. O

Um O
what O
about O
my H
day N
Tuesday O
? O

My H
sister H
tests N
positive N
. O

So O
, O
you H
know O
like O
I H
go O
oh O
shit O
like O
I've O
I H
've O
been O
hanging O
out H
in O
the O
car N
with O
her O
. O

Even O
though O
I H
was O
wearing O
a O
mask N
, O
she O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
wearing O
a O
mask N
, O
and O
she O
was O
like O
obviously O
coughing O
um O
. O

And O
so O
that O
prolonged O
period N
of O
time N
, O
we H
were O
probably O
in O
the O
car N
with O
each O
other O
for O
like O
40 O
minutes N
because O
we H
drove O
one N
way N
and O
then O
drove O
back O
. O

That O
40 O
minutes N
, O
her O
coffee N
in O
the O
car N
, O
the O
– O
all O
the O
windows N
closed O
, O
and O
even O
though O
I H
had O
a O
mask N
on O
, O
the O
virus N
circulates O
. O

That O
Tuesday O
, O
I H
remember O
I H
had O
been O
getting O
a O
little O
bit N
more O
symptomatic O
. O

My H
sore O
throat N
didn't O
did O
n't O
go O
away O
, O
um O
very O
very O
mild O
symptoms N
. O

I H
– O
all O
the O
clinics N
were O
closed O
by O
the O
time N
that O
she O
had O
gotten O
her O
results N
which O
was O
around O
like O
6:00 O
pm O
. O

I H
had O
booked O
an O
appointment N
or O
an O
e-visit O
with O
my H
um O
insurance N
to O
get O
me H
tested O
the O
next O
day N
. O

I H
get O
tested O
on O
Wednesday O
, O
and O
when O
I'm O
I H
'm O
tested O
on O
Wednesday O
, O
I H
remember O
that O
night N
, O
um O
I H
believe O
that O
was O
the O
day N
where O
I H
had O
actually O
gotten O
a O
fever N
and O
chills N
. O

So O
, O
at O
night N
I H
was O
getting O
really O
hot O
then O
getting O
cold O
then O
getting O
hot O
and O
cold O
. O

And O
I H
remember O
at O
one N
point N
I H
checked O
my H
temperature's O
temperature N
's H
only O
like O
98.7 O
, O
but O
at O
another O
point N
it O
was O
like O
101 O
or O
something O
really O
high O
that O
was O
obviously O
a O
fever N
. O

And O
then O
around O
day N
four O
, O
everything O
started O
to O
like O
stabilize O
. O

Five O
, O
it O
was O
like O
really O
nothing N
. O

Um O
day N
six O
was O
when O
I H
noticed O
like O
the O
my H
sinuses N
were O
feeling O
weird O
. O

It O
was O
no O
longer O
a O
headache N
anymore O
. O

It O
was O
more O
like O
my H
like O
congestion N
like O
right O
up O
here O
, O
it O
was O
like O
a O
weird O
. O

Know O
when O
it O
– O
you H
can't O
ca O
n't O
like O
sneeze N
? O

That's O
That O
's H
what O
the O
feeling O
was O
. O

It O
felt N
like O
like O
like O
there O
was O
a O
sneeze N
drop O
in O
there O
, O
and O
I H
couldn't O
could O
n't O
get O
it O
out H
. O

Um O
so O
, O
day N
six O
and O
seven O
, O
I H
started O
noticing O
that O
my H
taste N
buds N
started O
to O
change O
. O

Oh O
, O
let O
me H
mention N
, O
um O
nearly O
day N
two O
or O
three O
, O
my H
senses N
were O
like O
really O
really O
heightened O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
you H
remember O
the O
clip N
of O
when O
I H
had O
been O
eating O
those O
chips N
. O

Chips N
taste N
so O
strong O
to O
me H
. O

I H
guess O
that's O
that O
's H
like O
what O
happens O
when O
you H
lose O
your H
taste N
buds N
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
olfactory O
nerves N
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

So O
, O
from O
there O
, O
I H
had O
gotten O
um O
a O
complete O
180 O
and O
went O
from O
everything O
being O
like O
really O
heightened O
sense N
of O
taste N
and O
even O
the O
smell O
, O
because O
I H
remember O
I H
was O
gargling O
apple N
cider N
vinegar N
, O
and O
I H
remember O
smelling O
it O
from O
across O
the O
room N
, O
and O
now O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
really O
. O

Well O
, O
I H
would O
say O
that O
I H
have O
like O
30 O
percent N
of O
my H
taste N
and O
smell O
. O

So O
, O
for O
example N
, O
if O
you H
can O
see O
my H
Bath O
and O
Body O
Works N
candle N
, O
I H
try O
to O
smell O
that O
every O
morning N
to O
see O
if O
my H
change O
in O
smell O
changes N
, O
and O
I H
have O
like O
maybe O
30 O
percent N
of O
my H
like O
smelling O
capabilities N
. O

I H
have O
to O
get O
like O
this O
close O
to O
be O
able O
to O
smell O
the O
candle N
, O
which O
is O
insane O
because O
those O
candles N
are O
so O
strong O
, O
you H
literally O
open O
one N
up O
and O
you H
can O
smell O
it O
all O
over O
your H
room N
. O

I H
can O
still O
smell O
, O
but O
not O
to O
my H
like O
fullest O
capability N
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
you H
guys H
have O
seen O
those O
like O
TikToks O
where O
people N
try O
and O
drink N
different O
things N
like O
pickle N
juice N
and O
water N
and O
Gatorade O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
that's O
that O
's H
like O
super O
inaccurate O
. O

When O
you H
drink N
, O
you H
can O
still O
, O
for O
example N
, O
I H
took O
like O
a O
ginger N
shot N
this O
morning N
, O
and O
it O
had O
cayenne A
pepper A
. O

I H
can O
still O
that O
feel O
that O
burning O
sensation N
. O

So O
, O
for O
example N
, O
I H
tested O
if O
I H
could O
drink N
alcohol N
, O
and O
I H
drank O
a O
Truly O
, O
and O
I H
can O
still O
taste N
the O
alcohol N
like O
burning O
sensation N
going O
down O
. O

So O
, O
you H
can O
kind N
of O
distinguish O
if O
it's O
it O
's H
like O
sweet O
or O
salty O
or O
tart O
um O
, O
but O
you H
can't O
ca O
n't O
really O
taste N
it O
to O
its O
fullest O
if O
that O
makes O
any O
sense N
. O

Like O
like O
for O
example N
, O
I H
made O
mac N
and O
cheese N
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
you H
saw O
earlier O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
really O
know O
exactly O
how O
it O
tastes O
because O
I H
can O
only O
like O
I H
can O
kind N
of O
taste N
the O
cheese N
, O
um O
the O
saltiness N
, O
but O
it's O
it O
's H
more O
so O
um O
I'm O
I H
'm O
able O
to O
feel O
the O
textures N
. O

Neuroscience N
finals N
. O

Hi O
! O

Good O
morning N
, O
it O
is O
Monday O
May O
3rd O
10:38 O
a.m. O

I H
have O
a O
meeting N
at O
10:45 O
so O
in O
a O
few O
minutes N
with O
one N
of O
my H
TFs O
about O
my H
project N
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
gonna O
gon O
na O
meet O
with O
her O
quickly O
and O
see O
if O
she O
has O
any O
feedback N
and O
then O
I'll O
I H
'll O
be O
working O
on O
chem O
and O
neuro O
. O

She's O
She O
's H
not O
here O
yet O
. O

Hi O
! O

I'm O
I H
'm O
so O
sorry O
, O
I H
went O
to O
the O
section N
link N
. O

I H
was O
waiting O
there O
, O
I H
was O
like O
" O
uhm O
, O
did O
I H
get O
the O
time N
wrong O
? O
" O

But O
okay O
, O
this O
makes O
a O
lot N
more O
sense N
. O

My H
hair N
is O
in O
a O
bun N
. O

I H
took O
a O
shower N
. O

I H
should O
let O
it O
dry H
but O
I'm O
I H
'm O
too O
lazy O
to O
take O
it O
out H
. O

It's O
It O
's H
a O
new O
day N
, O
a O
little O
rainy O
outside O
. O

But O
I H
actually O
like O
when O
it's O
it O
's H
gloomy O
for O
studying O
because O
then O
I H
feel O
like O
there's O
there O
's H
nothing N
else O
you H
could O
be O
doing O
, O
so O
you H
might O
as O
well O
just O
stay O
inside O
and O
work N
. O

So O
I H
have O
some O
coffee N
and O
I'll O
I H
'll O
be O
focusing O
entirely O
on O
chem O
and O
neuro O
today N
, O
I H
think O
. O

Full O
day N
of O
studying O
, O
not O
really O
much O

I'm O
I H

Hi O
Kat H
! O

A H
lot N
of O
the O
notes N
that O
I H
had O
taken O
from O
our H
last O
meeting N
and O
being O
more O
of O
a O
cause N
or O
like O
leading N
to O
memory's O
memory N
's H
importance N
for O
each O
of O
the O
sources N
, O
I H
— O
I H
essentially O
changed O
it O
to O
um O
" O
it's O
it O
's H
the O
one N
persistent O
element N
of O
our H
existence N
that O
gives O
meaning N
to O
the O
inheritance N
of O
memory N
" O
. O

How O
do O
we H
remember O
? O

I H
asked O
this O
not O
only O
as O
a O
question N
of O
the O
methods N
, O
but O
also O
of O
the O
circumstances N
. O

Oh O
my H
god A
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
so O
tired O
. O

I H
accidentally O
posted O
a O
video N
I H
meant O
to O
schedule N
. O

So O
now O
I H
have O
to O
post N
about O
it O
. O

I H
like O
deleted O
Instagram O
and O
like O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
really O
checking O
social O
media N
too O
much O
this O
week N
, O
but O
now O
I H
have O
to O
redownload O
it O
, O
so O
I H
can O
post N
about O
it O
. O

Finals N
! O

Hello O
! O

It O
is O
May O
7th O
Friday O
May O
7th O
the O

currently O
9:46 O
a.m. O

I'm O

be O
taking O
it O
at O
10 O
a.m. O
, O
so O
I H
have O
15 O
minutes N
. O

The O
reason N
I'm O
I H
'm O
taking O
it O
like O
this O
early O
is O
because O
I H
have O
my H
med N
school N
class N
at O
two O
to O
four O
thirty O
, O
so O
we H
have O
three O
hours N
45 O
minutes N
to O
take O
it O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
gonna O
gon O
na O
take O
it O
at O
ten O
, O
so O
I H

for O
my H
class N
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
nervous O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
really O
nervous O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
feel O
too O
great O
about O
it O
, O
but O
I'm O
I H
'm O
going O
to O
be O
kind N
to O
myself H
with O
this O
. O

It O
was O
a O
really O
weird O
tiring O
semester N
, O
I H
think O
, O
relatively O
, O
compared O
to O
last O
semester N
, O
so O
you H
know O
, O
it O
is O
what O
it O
is O
. O

I'll O
I H
'll O
try O
my H
best O
and O

Um O
, O
which O
you H
always O
want O
to O

on O
the O
moisture N
of O
your H
hair N
, O
but O
the O
colder O
months N
in O
some O
areas N
of O
the O
world N
can O
be O
brutal O
. O

Um O

I'm O
I H
'm O

products N
. O

So O
this O
product N

is O
the O
Angelic O
Coco O
line N
, O
and O
I H
have O
been O
working O
on O
this O
line N
since O
2019 O
. O

Um O
, O
as O
you H
guys H

there's O
there O
's H
only O
two O
products N
, O
but O
of O
course N
I'm O
I H
'm O
going O
to O
be O
expanding O
. O

Um O
, O
and O
you H
guys H
will O
see O
, O
like O
, O
a O
lot N
more O
stuff N
in O
the O
future N
, O
but O
first O
we H
want O
to O
focus O
on O
these O
two O
products N
. O

I H
wanted O
to O
get O
these O
out H
to O
you H
guys H
because O
you H
guys H
have O
been O
asking O
for O
styling O
products N
since O
the O
beginning O
, O
so O
I'm O
I H
'm O
so O
glad O
to O
finally O
have O
actual O
styling O
products N
that O
I H
can O
, O
um O
, O
you H
know O
, O
present N
to O
you H
guys H
. O

So O
this O
first O
product N
that O
I'm O
I H
'm O
going O
to O
show O
you H
guys H
is O
the O
Nourished O
by O
Shawnta O
Curl O
Defining O
and O
Soft O
Hold O
Styler O
, O
which O
is O
enriched O
with O
sesame A
seed N
oil N
and O
rose O
essence N
. O

So O
it's O
it O
's H
the O
Angelic O
Coco O
Curl O
Creator O
Cream O
, O
and O
it O
has O
coconut N
plus O
rose O
in O
it O
. O

So O
this O
product N
is O
– O
I H
just O
– O
I H
love O
it O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
so O
moisturizing O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
really O
really O
thick O
. O

You H
guys H
can O
see O
on O
the O
camera N
it's O
it O
's H
super O
thick O
. O

Um O
, O
it O
does O
have O
like O
a O
butter N
feel O
to O
it O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
a O
cream N
, O
but O
it O
has O
a O
really O
buttery O
feel O
to O
it O
. O

And O
it's O
it O
's H
of O
course N
white O
, O
hence O
the O
name N
" O
Angelic O
Coco O
" O
. O

The O
ingredients N
in O
here O
are O
super O
jam N
- O
packed O
. O

There's O
There O
's H
even O
honey N
in O
here O
. O

I H
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
this O
styler H
actually O
contributes O
to O
the O
health N
of O
your H
hair N
. O

So O
a O
lot N
of O
times N
with O
stylers H
, O
they're O
they O
're O
just O
, O
you H
know O
, O
there O
to O
give O
you H
a O
nice O
style N
, O
which O
is O
great O
, O
but O
I H
want O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
all O
my H
products N
are O
geared O
towards O
the O
health N
of O
the O
hair N
even O
if O
they're O
they O
're O
styling O
products N
. O

So O
I H
was O
, O
like O
, O
not O
backing O
down O
on O
that O
part N
. O

So O
there O
are O
, O
like O
, O
really O
jam N
- O
packed O
vitamins N
, O
nutrients N
in O
this O
formula N
. O

As O
I H
mentioned O
, O
one N
of O
the O
ingredients N
is O
pure O
honey N
, O
along O
with O
a O
lot N
more O
nutrient N
- O
dense O
botanicals N
and O
herbs A
. O

There's O
There O
's H
even O
horsetail A
in O
here O
, O
which O
is O
amazing O
for O
hair N
growth N
. O

So O
this O
is O
geared O
towards O
moisturizing O
your H
hair N
and O
also O
hair N
growth N
. O

As O
you H
guys H
know O
, O
that's O
that O
's H
all O
I H
talk O
about O
on O
my H
channel N
most O
of O
the O
time N
. O

I H
really O
did O
want O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
I H
infused O
that O
into O
the O
product N
as O
well O
. O

If O
you H
guys H
are O
wondering O
, O
the O
smell O
of O
this O
product N
is O
very O
natural O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
very O
natural O
, O
and O
it O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
strong O
scent N
. O

With O
all O
of O
my H
products N
are O
normally O
like O
a O
pretty O
natural O
smell O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
put O
really O
really O
strong O
scents N
in O
my H
products N
. O

I H
can O
just O
like O
– O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
even O
begin O
to O
tell O
you H
how O
much O
time N
and O
effort N
I H
put O
into O
this O
line N
. O

And O
, O
um O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
just O
super O
excited O
. O

I H
just O
– O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
say O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
like O
" O
What O
else O
can O
I H
say O
? O
What O
else O
can O
I H
say O
? O
" O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
say O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
just O
so O
excited O
to O
finally O
, O
like O
, O
give O
it O
to O
you H
guys H
and O
know O
that O
it's O
it O
's H
gonna O
gon O
na O
contribute O
to O
the O
actual O
health N
of O
your H
hair N
. O

You H
can O
use H
this O
on O
twist N
outs N
. O

You H
can O
use H
this O
on O
braid N
outs N
. O

You H
can O
even O
use H
it O
on O
your H
wash O
- O
n O
- O
go O
as O
well O
. O

But O
I H
will O
say O
with O
wash O
- O
n O
- O
go's N
a- O
on O
my H
channel N
, O
I H
always O
show O
you H
guys H
wash O
- O
n O
- O
go's N
where O
I H
put O
a O
gel N
on O
there O
. O

So O
I H
could O
not O
come O
out H
with O
a O
cream N
and O
tell O
you H
guys H
just O
– O
" O
You H
can O
use H
it O
on O
your H
wash O
- O
n O
- O
go's N
" O
when O
that O
would O
kinda O
go O
against O
all O
that O
I've O
I H
've O
always O
said O
on O
my H
channel N
, O
which O
is O
" O
Gels N
actually O
are O
what O
make O
your H
wash O
- O
n O
- O
go O
stay O
. O
" O

So O
that O
brings O
us H
to O
the O
next O
product N
, O
which O
is O
my H
curl O
defining O
jelly N
. O

I H
have O
a O
gel N
as O
well O
, O
so O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
just O
a O
cream N
. O

I H
have O
another O
styler H
as O
well O
, O
which O
is O
a O
gel N
. O

So O
the O
next O
product N
is O
the O
Angelic O
Clear O
Coarse O
Jelly O
with O
aloe A
plus O
rosemary A
, O
and O
it's O
it O
's H
a O
curl O
- O
defining O
and O
light N
- O
to O
- O
medium N
whole O
jelly N
, O
and O
it's O
it O
's H
enriched O
with O
aloe A
vera O
juice N
, O
which O
is O
amazing O
. O

Amazing O
for O
hair N
moisture N
. O

So O
with O
gels N
– O
a O
lot N
of O
times N
you H
will O
find O
gels N
that O
kinda O
, O
like O
, O
dry H
out H
your H
hair N
. O

Lots N
of O
ingredients N
in O
it O
that O
kinda O
like O
counteracts O
what O
you H
would O
typically O
want O
for O
your H
hair N
. O

But O
a O
lot N
of O
times N
we H
kinda O
, O
like O
, O
deal O
with O
it O
because O
, O
you H
know O
, O
the O
gel N
is O
what's O
what O
's H
gonna O
gon O
na O
keep O
our H
hair N
in O
place N
and O
make O
it O
actually O
last O
. O

So O
I H
wanted O
to O
make O
a O
gel N
that O
did O
not O
do O
any O
of O
those O
things N
. O

So O
this O
gel N
is O
going O
to O
give O
a O
light N
- O
to O
- O
medium N
health N
. O

You H
guys H
already O
know O
that O
– O
if O
you H
follow O
my H
channel N
for O
a O
while O
, O
you H
know O
that O
I H
use H
, O
like O
, O
light N
defining O
gels N
and O
jellies N
and O
stuff N
all O
throughout O
my H
channel N
. O

Um O
, O
and O
more O
of O
the O
harder O
gels N
that O
really O
, O
like O
, O
make O
your H
hair N
feel O
super O
hard O
– O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
normally O
use H
those O
because O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
feel O
like O
you H
need O
all O
that O
. O

You H
just O
need O
, O
like O
, O
a O
nice O
holding O
gel N
. O

Good O
morning N
! O

So O
we H
just O
slept O
in O
today N
because O
it's O
it O
's H
our H
last O
day N
here O
in O
Glacier O
and O
we've O
we H
've O
been O
getting O
up O
at O
five O
o'clock O
every O
morning N
so O
that O
we H
could O
get O
into O
the O
park N
and O
get O
hiking N
early O
. O

And O
on O
our H
last O
day N
we H
were O
like O
" O
we're O
we H
're O
sleeping O
in O
" O
. O

So O
we H
slept O
to O
like O
7:15 O
today N
. O

Anyways O
I H
just O
wanted O
to O
show O
you H
guys H
this O
is O
what O
our H
shoes N
look O
like O
every O
day N
after O
we H
get O
done O
hiking N
in O
Glacier O
. O

They're O
They O
're O
super O
super O
super O
dusty O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
how O
the O
paths N
are O
, O
so O
I H
have O
to O
clean O
them O
every O
day N
um O
but O
yeah O
. O

So O
that's O
that O
's H
fun O
just O
a O
heads N
up O
, O
hiking N
in O
Glacier O
, O
it's O
it O

just O
the O
dusty O
dirt N
paths N
are O
very O
dusty O
. O

They O
are O
all O
cleaned O
up O
! O

But O
hey O
I H
just O
wanted O
to O
give O
a O
shout N
out H
to O
these O
Adidas O
Terrex O
shoes N
, O
I H
literally O
bought O
these O
hiking N
shoes N
right O
before O
our H
trip N
. O

They O
literally O
arrived O
on O
my H
doorstep N
the O
day N
before O
we H
left O
for O
the O
trip N
because O
I H
needed O
some O
new O
hiking N
shoes N
, O
and O
these O
have O
been O
absolutely O
the O
best O
hiking N
shoes N
I've O
I H
've O
ever O
owned O
. O

So O
if O
you're H
you H
're O
in O
a O
need O
for O
some O
new O
hiking N
shoes N
I H
definitely O
recommend O
these O
Adidas O
Terrex O
. O

What O
I H
like O
about O
these O
is O
that O
they're O
they O
're O
tennis N
shoe N
- O
like O
then O
they O
have O
the O
rubber N
soles N
on O
the O
front N
for O
if O
you're H
you H
're O
walking O
through O
, O
like O
, O
wet O
grass A
areas N
and O
the O
grip N
on O
these O
guys H
are O
amazing O
. O

So O
these O
have O
been O
awesome O
for O
hiking N
and O
I H
highly O
recommend O
them O
, O
especially O
if O
you're H
you H
're O
looking O
for O
like O
a O
lighter O
shoe N
that's O
that O
's H
not O
heavy O
like O
hiking N
boots N
or O
anything O
. O

These O
have O
been O
great O
. O

If O
you H
need O
shoes N
, O
get O
these O
. O

So O
it's O
it O
's H
our H
last O
day N
and O
we H
are O
just O
driving O
the O
uh O
– O
Going O
to O
the O
Sun O
Road O
and O
we’re O
we H
’re O
just O
gonna O
gon O
na O
stop N
along O
wherever O
we H
want O
to O
go O
. O

We're O
We H
're O
not O
having O
any O
plans N
today N
and O
right O
now O
we H
are O
at O
like O
a O
river N
waterfall N
area N
, O
so O
yeah O
we're O
we H
're O
just O
gonna O
gon O
na O
kind N
of O
roll O
with O
whatever O
happens O
today N
, O
so O
just O
chill O
, O
relax O
and O
enjoy O
our H
last O
day N
in O
beautiful O
Glacier O
National O
Park H
! O

Alright O
so O
I H
think O
we're O
we H
're O
gonna O
gon O
na O
just O
do O
a O
tiny O
bit N
of O
hiking N
this O
morning N
just O
to O
kind N
of O
get O
out H
and O
move O
, O
and O
we H
feel O
pretty O
good O
from O
hiking N
12 O
miles N
yesterday N
, O
like O
we're O
we H
're O
totally O
ready O
to O
go O
again O
. O

So O
that's O
that O
's H
good O
! O

So O
I H
think O
we're O
we H
're O
gonna O
gon O
na O
start O
here O
at O
the O
loop N
trailhead N
which O
is O
the O
same O
highline O
– O
um O
, O
trail N
that O
we H
did O
the O
other O
day N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
just O
the O
other O
end N
of O
it O
, O
um O
, O
so O
we're O
we H
're O
just O
gonna O
gon O
na O
hike O
a O
little O
bit N
on O
that O
. O

It O
is O
overcast O
today N
and O
they O
said O
there O
could O
be O
some O
rain N
, O
so O
we're O
we H
're O
probably O
gonna O
gon O
na O
go O
far O
and O
that's O
that O
's H
okay O
. O

We H
really O
want O
to O
just O
chill O
out H
today N
so O
um O
we're O
we H
're O
just O
gonna O
gon O
na O
hike O
and O
see O
what O
happens O
. O

This O
is O
a O
pretty O
cool O
little O
thing N
that O
is O
posted O
here O
at O
the O
loop N
so O
this O
Going O

To H
- O
The O
- O
Sun O
Road O
is O
actually O
considered O
a O
national O
landmark N
now O
, O
how O

they O
declared O
it O
. O

That's O
That O

. O

It's O
It O

one N
of O
the O

pretty O
crazy O

Eventually O
I H
actually O
can O
check O
— O
maybe O
we H
can O
check O
for O
this O
at O
Target O
. O

I H
actually O
want O
to O
get O
one N
of O
those O
acrylic O
things N
where O
the O
lipsticks N
can O
just O
stand O
up O
in O
it O
and O
it O
looks O
super O
neat O
. O

Like O
that's O
that O
's H
definitely O
what O
I H
want O
. O

But O
I H
also O
need O
to O
clear N
a O
lot N
of O
these O
out H
because O
I H
know O
a O
lot N
of O
these O
lipsticks N
are O
at O
least O
over O
like O
two O
three O
years N
old O
and O
that's O
that O
's H
like O
not O
okay O
. O

Alright O
so O
let's O
let O
's H
have O
a O
quick O
look O
at O
this O
. O

My H
fancy O
lipsticks N
— O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
part N
with O
them O
yet O
. O

I H
just O
ca O
n't O
I H
literally O
can't O
ca O
n't O
so O
I'm O
I H
'm O
gonna O
gon O
na O
keep O
those O
. O

Let's O
Let O
's H
see O
. O

Okay O
so O
this O
is O
a O
Pat H
McGrath H
lipstick N
. O

Oh O
my H
gosh O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
like O
the O
most O
beautiful O
red O
lipstick N
. O

Look O
at O
this O
. O

Let O
me H
swatch O
it O
for O
you H
real O
quick O
, O
real O
quick O
. O

Mm O
! O

Look O
at O
how O
beautiful O
this O
is O
. O

I H
feel O
like O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
throw O
it O
away O
. O

But O
anyways O
, O
so O
on O
the O
bottom N
of O
this O
lipstick N
you H
can O
see O
where O
it O
says O
eighteen O
months N
is O
the O
shelf N
life N
so O
. O

Let O
me H
see O
if O
I H
can O
— O

Can O
you H
all O
see O
this O
? O

I H
will O
definitely O
insert O
a O
little O
clip N
here O
that O
will O
show O
you H
what O
the O
shelf N
life N
symbol N
looks O
like O
on O
products N
. O

So O
you H
will O
find O
this O
on O
all O
your H
cosmetics N
, O
your H
makeup N
. O

It O
is O
usually O
on O
there O
. O

So O
when O
it O
says O
eighteen O
M N
that O
means N
that O
product N
, O
after O
eighteen O
months N
, O
is O
expired O
. O

I H
feel O
like O
this O
is O
not O
too O
far O
past N
eighteen O
months N
, O
and O
I H
mean O
look O
at O
the O
red O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
beautiful O
, O
so O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
part N
with O
it O
. O

This O
is O
a O

don't O
do O
n't O

what O
that O
means N
. O

Okay O

I H
'm O
a O
just O
put O
all O
the O
Dose O
of O
Color N
in O
a O
separate O
pile N
cuz O
that's O
that O
's H
kind N
of O
weird O
. O

I H
might O

to O
research N
that O
a O
little O
bit N
. O

Oh O

Okay O
. O

Let O

the O
fancy O
lipsticks N
have O
a O
shelf N
life N
of O
twelve O
months N
, O
so O

full O
year N
. O

I H
know O
I've O
I H
've O
definitely O
had O
this O
over O
a O
year N
though O
. O

I H
think O
. O

Have O
I H
had O
this O
over O
a O
year N
? O

My H
gosh O
it's O
it O
's H
hard O
to O
think O
back O
. O

But O
yeah O
this O
just O
does O
not O
look O
good O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
gonna O
gon O
na O
have O
to O
go O
in O
the O
expired O
pile N
. O

Yikes O
! O

This O
black O
is O
also O
not O
looking O
good O
. O

I H
feel O
like O
I've O
I H
've O
only O
had O
the O
black O
since O
last O
year N
Halloween O
though O
. O

Or H
was O
it O
the O
Halloween O
before O
? O

Guys H
this O
is O
harder O
than O
I H
thought O
. O

I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
remember O
when O
I H
bought O
things N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
not O
looking O
good O
though O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
all O
like O
super O
separated O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
like O
how O
that O
looks O
. O

Expired O
! O

Oh O
so O
this O
is O
interesting O
. O

Black H
Up O
actually O
has O
twenty O
four O
months N
of O
shelf N
life N
for O
their O
lip N
pencils N
which O
is O
really O
really O
good O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
two O
years N
. O

But O
is O
that O
actually O
good O
? O

Does O
that O
mean O
that O
this O
is O
chocked O
full O
of O
preservatives N
? O

That's O
That O
's H
like O
not O
healthy O
for O
you H
? O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
! O

But O
I've O
I H
've O
definitely O
had O
this O
for O
more O
than O
two O
years N
. O

Expired O
. O

This O
blue O
lipstick N
is O
definitely O
old O
. O

Definitely O
old O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
you H
can O
actually O
tell O
by O
looking O
at O
it O
but O
she's O
she O
's H
old O
. O

Let's O
Let O
's H
see O
what O
the O
shelf N
life N
is O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
interesting O
. O

The O
Urban O
Decay O
does O
not O
have O
a O
shelf N
life N
on O
the O
actual O
stick N
. O

So O
you H
know O
how O
lipsticks N
usually O
come O
in O
packaging N
? O

It O
usually O
comes O
in O
that O
little O
box N
? O

I'm O
I H
'm O
thinking O
that O
maybe O
Dose O
of O
Colors O
and O
Urban O
Decay O
have O
the O
shelf N
life N
printed O
on O
those O
boxes N
but O
who O
keeps O
their O
lipsticks N
in O
a O
box N
? O

Like O
how O
do O
I H
know O
now O
if O
this O
is O
expired O
or O
not O
? O

I've O
I H
've O
definitely O
had O
this O
over O
two O
years N
though O
so O
I'm O
I H
'm O
just O
gonna O
gon O
na O
go O
ahead O
and O
throw O
it O
in O
the O
expired O
pile N
. O

I H
feel O
like O
two O
years N
is O
kind N
of O
the O
limit O
that O
I've O
I H
've O
seen O
so O
far O
. O

This O
has O
a O
shelf N
life N
of O
six O
months N
! O

Expired O
. O

So O
this O
is O
the O
throw O
out H
slash O
expired O
pile N
. O

This O
is O
the O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
do O
with O
it O
pile N
, O
but O
I H
think O
these O
are O
all O
the O
Dose O
of O
Colors O
lipsticks N
that O
I H
know O
I've O
I H
've O
had O
for O
at O
least O
over O
two O
years N
. O

Hey O

feels O
like O

here O
and O
I H
never O
miss O
a O
year N
of O
mermaid A
content N
. O

This O
theme N
is O
a O
Grecian O
mermaid A
. O

I H
really O
wanted O

do O
something O
with O
pearls N
and O

an O
updo O
and O

really O
bronzy O
makeup N

And O
the O
tail N

have O
a O
silicone N
tail N
this O
time N
, O
is O
very O
similar O
to O
this O

tone N
, O
and O
my H
friend H
Marianne H
is O
staying O
with O
us H
and O
I H
love O

So O

of O
Grecian O
top N
, O

very O
quickly O

This O
was O
my H
favorite O
area N
in O
the O
park N

maybe O
because O

so O
epic O
. O

Everything O

Justin H
Bieber O
. O

Ohh O
, O
I H
thought O
it O
was O
V N
. O

Bieber O
not O
like O
the O
animal A
! O

Hi O
everyone O
! O

So O
I'm O
I H
'm O
just O
about O
to O
tuck O
into O
a O
crisp O
sandwich N
. O

Salt O
vinegar N
squares N
are O
my H
crisp O
of O
choice N
. O

And O
I've O
I H
've O
got O
some O
apple N
juice N
because O
this O
signifies O
kind N
of O
my H
diet N
staples N
the O
last O
few O
weeks N
. O

So O
I H
thought O
this O
was O
an O
opportune O
time N
to O
tell O
you H
all O
that O
a O
couple N
of O
weeks N
ago O
I H
found O
out H
that O
I H
am O
pregnant O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
the O
first O
week N
that O
I've O
I H
've O
been O
actually O
able O
to O
say O
the O
words N
" O
I'm O
I H
'm O
pregnant O
" O
and O
have O
it O
not O
feel O
really O
weird O
. O

I H
found O
out H
on O
, O
I H
think O
it O
was O
the O
3rd O
of O
January O
. O

Let's O
Let O
's H
just O
double O
check O
that O
. O

No O
, O
excuse O
me H
, O
it O
was O
the O
fifth O
of O
January O
. O

I H
found O
out H
on O
the O
fifth O
and O
that O
was O
because O
my H
period N
was O
late O
and O
I H
am O
never O
late O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
I H
came O
off O
the O
pill N
my H
period N
came O
back O
pretty O
regularly O
and O
I H
started O
tracking O
my H
periods N
just O
because O
I H
knew O
the O
pregnancy N
was O
something O
that O
eventually O
we H
would O
want O
, O
and O
I H
know O
that O
it O
helps O
if O
you've O
you H
've O
been O
tracking O
your H
period N
so O
you H
know O
your H
cycle N
. O

And O
for O
the O
first O
few O
days N
/ O
couple N
of O
weeks N
I H
felt N
really O
anxious O
, O
really O
scared O
, O
really O
worried O
, O
because O
my H
initial O
reaction N
was O
, O
and O
still O
now O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
a O
bit N
like O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
old O
enough O
for O
this O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
grown O
up O
enough O
to O
do O
this O
. O

You H
feel O
like O
you're H
you H
're O
prepared O
, O
you're H
you H
're O
in O
a O
, O
you H
know O
, O
in O
a O
relationship N
. O

We H
have O
been O
in O
a O
relationship N
for O
years N
, O
we're O
we H
're O
adults H
, O
but O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
it O
is O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
I H
found O
out H
I H
just O
went O
back O
to O
like O
a O
14 O
year N
old O
girl H
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
like O
" O
oh O
my H
god A
, O
what O
am O
I H
gonna O
gon O
na O
tell O
my H
mom H
? O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
be O
a O
mom H
. O
" O

So O
really O
I H
was O
just O
very O
very O
overwhelmed O
and O
anxious O
so O
it O
took O
a O
few O
days N
for O
me H
to O
really O
process N
what O
happened O
. O

It O
was O
quite O
a O
shock N
and O
it's O
it O
's H
such O
a O
huge O
huge O
thing N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
life N
- O
changing O
, O
and O
so O
for O
the O
first O
couple N
of O
weeks N
that's O
that O
's H
all O
I H
could O
focus O
on O
, O
was O
how O
life N
- O
changing O
it O
was O
and O
it O
was O
really O
scary O
. O

I H
then O
started O
to O
talk O
to O
people N
about O
it O
, O
that O
made O
me H
feel O
better O
. O

And O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
really O
sure O
what O
I'm O
I H
'm O
trying O
to O
say O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
this O
to O
be O
too O
, O
like O
, O
all O
over O
the O
place N
but O
I H
decided O
I H
do O
want O
to O
document N
this O
some O
way N
, O
whether O
I H
– O
at O
first O
I H
was O
like O
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
copy N
it O
on O
YouTube O
but O
I H
definitely O
wanted O
to O
document N
this O
in O
some O
kind N
of O
video N
form N
, O
just O
because O
it's O
it O
's H
such O
a O
huge O
thing N
. O

You’re O
You H
’re O
only O
pregnant O
for O
the O
first O
time N
once O
. O

But O
I H
did O
want O
to O
document N
my H
first O
trimester N
to O
an O
extent N
, O
because O
when O
I H
first O
found O
out H
, O
I H
did O
start O
to O
watch O
videos N
of O
people's O
people N
's H
first O
few O
weeks N
, O
but O
again O
, O
maybe O
because O
I H
wasn't O
was O
n't O
in O
a O
great O
headspace N
, O
that O
just O
frightened O
me H
, O
which O
again O
was O
because O
everyone O
was O
just O
saying O
how O
awful O
they O
felt N
, O
how O
excited O
they O
were O
, O
and O
I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
feel O
excited O
. O

I H
felt N
worried O
. O

The O
thought O
of O
telling O
, O
like O
, O
my H
mom H
. O

I H
cried O
when O
I H
told O
her O
because O
I H
felt N
so O
, O
just O
, O
like O
, O
oh O
my H
god A
. O

I H
mean O
you H
, O
you H
feel O
quite O
bad O
when O
you H
feel O
like O
that O
, O
because O
it's O
it O
's H
such O
a O
happy O
thing N
and O
now O
, O
you H
know O
, O
I H
– O
you H
know O
, O
I H
know O
I've O
I H
've O
kind N
of O
accepted O
. O

The O
shock N
has O
kind N
of O
sunk O
in O
. O

And O
I H
am O
happy O
to O
tell O
people N
, O
but O
at O
first O
when O
you're H
you H
're O
trying O
to O
get O
your H
head N
around O
it O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
very O
daunting O
and O
you H
just O
feel O
awful O
thinking O
. O

The O
thought O
of O
telling O
someone H
makes O
me H
want O
to O
burst O
into O
tears N
. O

All O
these O
things N
going O
onto O
my H
head N
. O

So O
that O
also O
then O
helped O
me H
to O
make O
the O
decision N
that O
I H
do O
want O
to O
document N
this O
, O
but O
I'm O
I H
'm O
probably O
going O
to O
do O
it O
, O
like O
, O
with O
hindsight N
, O
so O
I H
check O
in O
every O
now O
and O
again O
and O
just O
let O
you H
know O
how O
I've O
I H
've O
been O
feeling O
. O

But O
in O
terms N
of O
if O
I H
am O
sick O
or O
I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
feeling O
great O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
gonna O
gon O
na O
vlog O
whilst O
I H
feel O
like O
that O
. O

I H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
want O
to O
vlog O
whilst O
I H
feel O
like O
that O
if O
I H
was O
just O
ill O
anyway O
. O

And O
I H
just O
think O
it O
didn't O
did O
n't O
help O
me H
seeing O
people N
at O
their O
worst O
at O
the O
very O
beginning O
, O
because O
all O
you H
hear O
is O
doom N
and O
gloom N
. O

I H
decided O
to O
wait N
a O
few O
weeks N
before O
I H
even O
started O
to O
talk O
about O
it O
, O
so O
I H
think O
I'm O
I H
'm O
about O
seven O
weeks N
. O

I H
am O
waiting O
for O
my H
first O
midwife H
appointment N
. O

I H
went O
– O
I H
booked O
the O
doctors H
, O
because O
the O
NHS O
says O
you H
need O
to O
book O
a O
doctor's O
doctor H
's H
appointment N
, O
but O
that O
was O
a O
waste O
of O
time N
and O
I H
felt N
quite O
bad O
about O
taking O
that O
appointment N
. O

Because O
in O
my H
area N
you'd O
you H
'd O
have O
to O
self O
- O
refer O
, O
so O
I H
haven't O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
kind N
of O
appointment N
or O
checkups N
or O
anything O
but O
I H
have O
been O
tracking O
– O
tracking O
– O

I've O
I H
've O
got O
an O
app O
called O
" O
what O
to O
expect O
" O
, O
put O
in O
my H
, O
you H
know O
, O
cycle N
situation N
and O
have O
an O
estimated O
due O
date N
, O
which O
is O
about O
mid-September O
. O

In O
terms N
of O
symptoms N
, O
I H
mean O
I H
haven't O
have O
n't O
felt N
the O
best O
, O
but O
I H
have O
been O
able O
to O
get O
through O
it O
. O

I've O
I H
've O
definitely O
struggled O
on O
some O
days N
but O
I H
haven't O
have O
n't O
been O
sick O
. O

The O
biggest O
thing N
for O
me H
is O
I H
have O
lost O
– O
I H
dipped O
, O
and O
I H
have O
lost O
my H
appetite N
. O

There's O
There O
's H
nothing N
I H
really O
feel O
like O
eating O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
particular O
aversions N
to O
things N
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
feel O
really O
sick O
when O
I H
smell O
anything O
at O
the O
moment N
. O

But O
there's O
there O
's H
things N
that O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
have O
, O
so O
like O
coffee N
, O
I H
just O
know O
that O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
that O
, O
and O
all O
I H
want O
is O
beige O
: O

I H
want O
chips N
, O
I H
want O
white O
toast O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
pretty O
much O
all O
I H
eat O
all O
day N
. O

Pasta N
if O
I H
want O
something O
hot O
maybe O
, O
I've O
I H
've O
had O
soup N
, O
but O
essentially O
starchy O
carbs O
and O
that's O
that O
's H
quite O
normal O
it O
seems O
. O

Like O
, O
everyone O
craves O
that O
at O
this O
point N
because O
you're H
you H
're O
, O
you H
know O
, O
building N
a O
baby H
, O
so O
you H
need O
that O
energy N
. O

So O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
feel O
particularly O
great O
nutrition-wise O
, O
and O
I'm O
I H
'm O
trying O
to O
eat O
fruit N
where O
I H
can O
and O
eat O
veg N
when O
I H
can O
, O
but O
I'm O
I H
'm O
just O
sort N
of O
going O
with O
it O
, O
because O
I H
know O
there's O
there O
's H
enough O
information N
out H
there O
that O
this O
is O
generally O
how O
it O
goes O
. O

And O
then O
hopefully O
you H
start O
to O
feel O
a O
bit N
better O
. O

I H
have O
felt N
nauseous O
and O
as O
everyone O
describes O
it O
, O
a O
bit N
jet N
- O
lagged O
, O
a O
bit N
cloudy O
in O
my H
head N
, O
and O
the O
worst O
thing N
for O
me H
has O
been O
headaches N
. O

I H
haven't O
have O
n't O
had O
them O
this O
week N
, O
but O
last O
week N
I H
had O
a O
couple N
of O
really O
really O
bad O
ones N
and O
I H
haven't O
have O
n't O
had O
headaches N
that O
bad O
for O
years N
. O

Good O
morning N
! O

So O
remember O
how O
yesterday N
when O
I H
showed O
you H
the O
thingy O
thing N
there O
were O
like O
very O
high O
waves N
in O
the O
lagoon N
? O

Well O
, O
today N
is O
like O
the O
exact O
opposite N
. O

This O
is O
like O
the O
calmest O
water N
you H
might O
have O
seen O
. O

This O
is O
so O
beautiful O
. O

And O
I'm O
I H
'm O
drinking O
instant O
coffee N
, O
but O
the O
instant O
coffee N
is O
actually O
from O
Bremen O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
crazy O
, O
right O
? O

In O
South O
Africa O
I'm O
I H
'm O
drinking O
instant O
coffee N
that O
is O
from O
Bremen O
. O

Not O
the O
best O
representation N
of O
my H
city N
I H
guess O
, O
because O
it's O
it O
's H
instant O
coffee N
. O

We H
are O
heading O
out H
here O
at O
10:00 O
a.m. O
I H
think O
, O
and O
then O
on O
the O
way N
back O
we're O
we H
're O
stopping O
at O
a O
winery N
for O
, O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
for O
looking O
at O
it O
, O
and O
then O
we're O
we H
're O
gonna O
gon O
na O
head N
back O
. O

So O
firstly O
the O
Sauvignon O
Blanc O
which O
is O
for O
you H
, O
for O
you H
sir H
. O

So O
the O
Sauvignon O
Blanc O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
naturally O
high O
- O
acidic O
grape N
, O
and O
then O
if O
you H
smell O
it O
you H
pick O
up O
grassy O
aromas N
, O
lots N
of O
passion N
fruits N
, O
gooseberry A
flavors N
in O
the O
palate N
. O

So O
this O
is O
a O
warmer O
climate N
Sauvignon O
Blanc O
, O
well O
balanced O
acidity N
, O
2018 O
vintage N
, O
very O
crisp O
and O
fresh O
and O
it O
is O
unwooded O
. O

And O
then O
the O
Chardonnay O
- O
Pinot O
Noir O
, O
it O
is O
a O
blended O
wine N
of O
60 O
% O
Chardonnay O
and O
40 O
% O
Pinot O
Noir O
, O
so O
it's O
it O
's H
more O
like O
a O
dry H
rosé O
style N
of O
wine N
with O
lots N
of O
strawberry N
flavors N
, O
hints N
of O
yellow O
apple N
, O
and O
it's O
it O
's H
2018 O
vintage N
, O
which O
is O
unwooded O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
very O
fresh O
and O
crisp O
. O

Okay O
? O

Is O
it O
a O
popular O
wine N
? O

Chardonnay O
? O

Yes O
, O
in O
South O
Africa O
Chardonnay O
and O
Pinot O
Noir O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
a O
popular O
wine N
. O

Interesting O
. O

And O
then O
with O
the O
Chardonnay O
, O
Chardonnay O
is O
naturally O
high O
- O
acidic O
, O
but O
not O
so O
much O
aromatic O
on O
the O
nose N
, O
so O
you H
pick O
up O
lots N
of O
citrus O
fruits N
, O
limes N
, O
lemons N
on O
the O
palate N
, O
and O
this O
is O
2017 O
vintage N
, O
also O
unwooded O
. O

So O
these O
are O
the O
type N
of O
wine N
that O
you H
can O
enjoy O
on O
their O
own O
and O
also O
with O
your H
light N
meals N
, O
because O
they O
are O
made O
to O
open O
now O
, O
drink N
now O
wines N
. O

Can O
I H
ask O
you H
, O
with O
your H
white O
wines N
, O
how O
– O
how O
long O
– O
when's O
when O
's H
the O
best O
time N
to O
drink N
them O
? O

Is O
it O
sooner O
? O

Yes O
, O
yes O
, O
sooner O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
open O
now O
drink N
now O
wines N
, O
as O
I H
said O
they O
are O
lifestyle N
wines N
, O
easy O
drinking O
, O
everyday O
drinking O
styles N
. O

But O
if O
you H
want O
to O
keep O
them O
, O
I H
would O
say O
keep O
them O
5 O
years N
in O
the O
cellar N
. O

Oh O
, O
you H
can O
? O

Yes O
you H
can O
keep O
them O
in O
your H
cellar N
, O
and O
then O
the O
red O
wines N
, O
keep O
six O
years N
to O
seven O
years N
, O
not O
more O
than O
that O
. O

And O
then O
with O
the O
red O
wines N
from O
the O
Signature O
they O
only O
spent O
eight O
months N
in O
the O
French O
oak N
. O

So O
the O
reason N
behind O
that O
shorter O
period N
of O
time N
is O
for O
you H
to O
get O
more O
of O
the O
original O
flavors N
from O
the O
grapes N
, O
not O
so O
much O
of O
the O
secondary O
flavor N
since O
they O
are O
more O
level N
entry N
wines N
. O

So O
the O
Pinotage O
is O
a O
uniquely O
grown O
South O
African O
grape N
. O

It O
was O
discovered O
in O
the O
year N
of O
1925 O
by O
a O
professor H
called O
Abraham H
Perold O
in O
the O
University N
of O
Stellenbosch O
. O

So O
it's O
it O
's H
a O
high O
grade N
grape N
that O
is O
made O
from O
Pinot O
Noir O
and O
the O
Hermitage O
. O

You H
took O
a O
stem O
of O
both O
, O
cross-breeded O
them O
. O

The O
Hermitage O
is O
known O
as O
the O
Cinsault O
today N
. O

So O
the O
Pinotage O
is O
very O
aromatic O
, O
has O
lots N
of O
plum N
fruits N
, O
red O
fruit N
flavors N
. O

The O
tanins O
are O
full O
of O
high O
tanins O
, O
but O
they O
are O
quite O
soft O
. O

This O
is O
a O
2017 O
vintage N
and O
then O
the O
Shiraz O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
known O
for O
its O
biasing O
characteristics N
, O
that O
what O
you H
pick O
up O
on O
the O
palette N
on O
the O
nose N
to O
the O
palate N
, O
spicy O
peppery O
flavor N
, O
has O
lots N
of O
great O
fruits N
and O
this O
is O
2017 O
vintage N
. O

And O
then O
the O
Cab O
, O
the O
Cabernet O
is O
known O
for O
its O
thick O
uh O
skin N
and O
it's O
it O
's H
known O
for O
when O
it's O
it O
's H
blended O
, O
it O
always O
acts N
as O
a O
backbone N
to O
the O
wine N
. O

So O
since O
this O
one N
had O
not O
much O
of O
the O
oak N
barrel N
you H
pick O
up O
the O
original O
black O
currant N
fruits N
, O
pencil N
shavings N
aromas N
, O
has O
lots N
of O
black O
cherries N
as O
well O
. O

This O
is O
the O
2017 O
vintage N
. O

So O
this O
– O

So O
, O
so O
with O
th- O
with O
these O
people N
, O
it's O
it O
's H
better O
to O
wait N
for O
these O
as O
well O
, O
even O
though O
they're O
they O
're O
your H
everyday O
– O

Would O
it O
be O
better O
to O
like O
say O
– O

Yes O
, O
three O
years' O
years N
' O
time N
, O
four O
years' O
years N
' O
time N
, O
yes O
. O

Remember O
, O
while O
it O
gets O
better O
with O
age N
, O
so O
, O
these O
also O
. O

OK O
, O
any O
questions N
? O

Thank O

That's O
That O
's H

The O
Chatham O
Islands N

, O
smaller O
Pitt H
Island O
with O
about O
40 O
inhabitants H
, O
and O
a O
number N
of O
rocky O
outcrops N
. O

The O
islands N
are O
volcanic O
in O
origin N
and O
have O
a O
unique O
and O
sensitive O
habitat N
that O
supports O
many O
rare O
and O
endangered O
species A
. O

The O
original O
people N
of O
the O
islands N
are O
the O
Moriori O
, O
who O
were O
descended O
from O
the O
Maori O

mainland N
New H

, O
but O
who O
developed O
their O

In O
1835 O
Maori O
settlers H
from O
the O

Cleveland O
from O
lakefront N
. O

Cleveland O
is O
the O
urban O
center N
of O
Northeast O
Ohio O
, O
the O
15th O
largest O
combined O
metropolitan O
area N
in O
the O
United O
States O
. O

Throughout O
the O
twentieth O
century N
, O
the O
City N
of O
Cleveland O
proper O
was O
ranked O
as O
one N
of O
the O
10 O
largest O
cities N
in O
the O
U.S. O
( O
from O
1890 O
until O
1970 O
per O
US O
Census O
Bureau O
statistics N
) O
. O

Like O
most O
U.S. O
cities N
, O
Cleveland O
proper O
began O
to O
lose O
population N
to O
suburban O
areas N
in O
the O
1960s N
and O
1970s N
. O

However O
, O
in O
the O
mid-1980s O
, O
Cleveland O
earned O
the O
nickname N
the O
" O
Comeback O
City N
" O
as O
the O
urban O
core N
experienced O
a O
dramatic O
revitalization N

that O
continues O
today N

As O
its O

continued O
, O
the O
official O
moniker N

now O
the O

earned O
the O
reputation N
as O
a O
model N
of O
effective O
public O

Despite O
the O

an O

just O
beyond O
the O

Like O

the O
so O

, O
Cleveland O
has O
endured O

it O
makes O
its O

the O

with O
the O
industrial O
era N
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O

when O
the O
city N

to O
be O
the O
heart N

- O
growing O

The O

which O

The O
rapid O
development N

in O
the O

in O
the O
summertime N
, O
so O
always O
have O
sunscreen N

Understand O

Why O
would O
anybody O
want O
to O
start O
a O
city N
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
desert N
? O

The O
answer N
is O
, O
surprisingly O
, O
agriculture N
. O

The O
Salt O
and O
Verde O
Rivers H
of O
central O
Arizona O
were O
exploited O
for O
large O
- O
scale N
agriculture N
by O
Native O
Americans O
as O
early O
as O
the O
11th O
century N
. O

The O
area N
that O
now O
encompasses O
Phoenix A
was O
a O
center N
of O
the O
Hohokam O
culture N
, O
which O
built O
large O
canal N
systems N
and O
a O
network N
of O
towns N
and O
villages N
, O
whose O
remains O
may O
be O
viewed O
in O
the O
city N
to O
this O
day N
. O

White H
settlers H
discovered O
the O
remnants N
of O
the O
Hohokam O
culture N
in O
the O
19th O
century N
. O

The O
city's O
city N
's H
name N
reflects O
its O
history N
as O
a O
city N
" O
reborn O
from O
the O
ashes N
" O
of O
the O
previous O
settlement N
. O

European O
- O
American O
settlement N
of O
the O
area N
commenced O
in O
the O
1860s N
, O
and O
in O
1911 O
the O
completion N
of O
the O
first O
of O
several O
large O
reservoirs N
in O
the O
mountains N
north O
and O
east O
of O
Phoenix A
insured O
its O
success N
as O
a O
center N
for O
irrigation N
- O
based O
agriculture N
. O

Many O
tens N
of O
thousands N
of O
acres N
were O
planted O
in O
citrus O
and O
cotton N
and O
other O
crops N
, O
and O
for O
many O
years N
, O
intensive O
, O
year N
- O
round O
irrigated O
agriculture N
formed O
the O
basis N
of O
the O
economy N
. O

Recent O
years N
are O
seeing O
a O
revival N
, O
and O
trendy O
hotels N
, O
bars N
, O
shops N
and O
restaurants N
are O
making O
it O
a O
place N
to O
be O
again O
. O

Warm O
and O
sunny O
winter N
weather N
also O
ensured O
a O
thriving O
tourism N
industry N
, O
and O
encouraged O
many O
Easterners H
and O
Midwesterners O
to O
relocate O
to O
Phoenix A
. O

High N

to O

, O
and O
since O
that O
time N
the O

As O
a O
result N
, O
a O

a O
UNESCO O

With O
over O
40,000 O
inhabitants H
, O
though O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
just O
a O
nature N
reserve O
. O

The O
Island O
is O
new O
to O
tourism N
, O
so O
if O
you H
are O
looking O
for O
a O
luxurious O
vacation N
this O
is O
not O
the O
right O
destination N
. O

However O
, O
Socotra O
is O
a O
perfect O
destination N
for O
the O
adventurous O
and O
nature N
loving O
travelers H
. O

Socotra O
takes O
pride N
in O
their O
eco O
- O
tourism N
and O
values N
their O
spectacular O
plant A
and O
wildlife A
that O
may O
sometimes O
be O
only O
found O
on O
this O
island N
. O

Although O
the O
lodging N
and O
facilities N
may O
not O
be O
the O
same O
as O
more O
modern O
and O
developed O
locations N
, O
Socotra O
is O
a O
beautiful O
and O
magnificent O
destination N
choice N
. O

Great H
care N
is O
shown O
to O
both O
guests H
and O
the O
environment N
. O

Socotra O
is O
an O
eco O
- O
tourism N
system N
with O
limited O
infrastructure N
and O
new O
to O
the O
international O
tourist H
market N
, O
and O
therefore O
the O
hotel N
accommodations N
are O
not O
quite O
like O
other O
destinations N
. O

However O
there O
are O
four O
hotels N
in O
Hadibo O
: O
Taj O
Socotra O
Hotel O
, O
Hafijj O
Hotel O
, O
Socotra O
Hotel O
, O
and O
Summer N
land O
Hotel O
. O

These O
hotels N
may O
not O
be O
the O
most O
luxerious O
, O
but O
they O
do O
provide O
air N
- O
conditionting N
, O
televisions N
, O
and O
refrigerators N
in O
all O
of O
the O
rooms N
. O

Most O
of O
the O
rooms N
at O
these O
hotels N
have O
their O
own O
bathroom N
, O
but O
there O
are O
a O
few O
rooms N
at O
the O
Hafijj O
Hotel O
and O
Socotra O
Hotel O
that O
must O
share O
bathrooms N
. O

Fortunately O
, O
there O
is O
a O
restaurant N
in O
each O
of O
the O
hotels N
with O
simple O
yet O
delicious O
cuisine N
. O

Considering O
Socotra O
is O
a O
fairly O
new O
eco O
- O
tourism N
destination N
, O
their O
facilities N
are O
decent O
. O

In O
addition N
, O
there O
is O
also O
another O
hotel N
at O
the O
airport N
as O
well O
as O
multiple O
guest H
houses N
around O
the O
island N
. O

The O
most O
popular O
lodging N
is O
actually O
camping N
on O
the O
beaches N
. O

There O
are O
several O
campsites N
that O
allow O
tourists H
to O
barbeque O
on O
the O
beach N
with O
beautiful O
mountain N
views N
in O
the O
background N
. O

Tourists H
can O
choose O
to O
purchase N
camping N
tour N
packages N
which O
include O
a O
driver H
or O
guide N
that O
will O
show O
tourists H
around O
the O
beaches N
as O
well O
as O
provide O
meals N
during O
their O
stay O
. O

It O
is O
a O
fantastic O
way N
to O
enjoy O
the O
beauty N
and O
wildlife A
of O
the O
island N
. O

A H
runway N
that O
provides O
fairly O
regular O
airline N
transportation N
was O
only O
constructed O
in O
1999 O
. O

Like O
everything O
else O
, O
infrastructure N
and O
transportation N
has O
only O
just O
begun O
in O
recent O
years N
. O

There O
are O
also O
plans N
for O
new O
harbor N
facilities N
that O
will O
allow O
fisherman H
to O
sell O
and O
catch O
more O
easily O
and O
make O
importing O
food N
and O
fuel N
simpler O
. O

In O
addition N
, O
there O
are O
also O
two O
information N
centers N
located O
at O
the O
airport N
and O
Hadibo O
. O

When O
to O
go O
: O
Climate N
is O
an O
important O
consideration N
. O

And O
this O
depends O
on O
your H
interest N

Nature H

go O
from O
early O
October O

Bringing O
a O
car N
to O
the O
islands N
serves O
little O
point N
but O
to O
rob O
your H
wallet N
of O
your H
hard O
earned O
cash N
, O
and O
you H
will O
be O
much O
better O
served O
by O
bringing O

renting O
a O
bike N
in O
Svendborg O
or O
Faaborg O
, O
or O
just O
simply O
walk O
since O
the O
islands N

generally O
small O
enough O
to O
make O
this O
feasible O
. O

While O
some O
islands N

connected O
by O
the O

you H
will O
generally O
have O
to O
go O
back O
to O
the O
mainland N
to O
pass O
between O
the O
islands N
, O
if O
you H
rely O
on O
public O

However O
the O
best O
way N

visit O
is O
really O
by O
boat N

and O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
options N

do O
this O

A H
popular O
option N

and O
one N
good O
for O
your H
health N

, O
is O
by O

There O
are O
several O

but O
remember O
to O
be O
realistic O
about O
your H
fitness N

as O
some O
of O
these O
routes N
take O
you H
a O
fair O
bit N

The O
traditional O
greeting N
known O
as O
the O
wai O
, O
where O
you H
press N
your H
hands N
together O
as O
is O
in O
prayer N
and O
bow N
slightly O
, O
is O
derived O
from O
the O
Hindu O
cultural O
influence N
from O
India O
, O
and O
still O
widely O
practised O
. O

Among O
Thais O
, O
there O
are O
strict O
rules N
of O
hierarchy N
that O
dictate O
how O
and O
when O
the O
wai O
should O
be O
given O
. O

In O
brief N
, O
inferiors H
salute O
superiors H
first O
. O

You H
should O
not O
wai O
service N
people N
or O
street N
vendors H
. O

The O
higher O
your H
hands N
go O
, O
the O
more O
respectful O
you H
are O
. O

You H
will O
also O
often O
see O
Thais O
doing O
a O
wai O
as O
they O
walk O
past N
temples N
and O
spirit N
houses N
. O

As O
a O
foreign O
visitor H
, O
you H
are O
not O
expected O
to O
know O
how O
to O
wai O
, O
nor O
to O
reciprocate O
when O
wai'd O
to O
; O

while O
you're H
you H
're O
unlikely O
to O
cause N
offense N
if O
you H
do O
, O
you H
may O
well O
look O
slightly O
strange O
. O

If O
somebody H
makes O
a O
wai O
to O
you H
, O
a O
slight O
bow N
alone O
is O
more O
than O
sufficient O
for O
ordinary O
occasions N
, O
and O
for O
business N
, O
most O
Thais O
will O
shake O
hands N

translates O
in O
many O
ways N

While O
some O

most O
Thais O
view N
an O
adult O
man H
wearing O

as O
fairly O
ridiculous O

primarily O
worn O
by O
laborers H

The O
rules N

even O
more O

so O
even O
if O

it's O
it O

Monks H
are O
an O
integral O
part N
of O
Buddhism O
in O
Thailand O
, O
and O
Thai O
men H
are O
generally O
expected O
to O
spend O
a O
certain O
amount N
of O
time N
living O
as O
a O
monk H
at O
least O
once O
in O
their O
lifetime N
. O

Buddhist O
monks H
are O
meant O
to O
avoid O
sexual O
temptations N
, O
and O
in O
particular O
they O
do O
not O
touch O
women H
or O
take O
things N
from O
women's O
women H
's H
hands N
. O

Women H
should O
make O
every O
effort N
to O
make O
way N
for O
monks H
on O
the O
street N
and O
give O
them O
room N
so O
they O
do O
not O
have O
to O
make O
contact O
with O
you H
. O

Women H
should O
avoid O
offering O
anything O
to O
a O
monk H
with O
their O
hands N
. O

Objects N
or O
donations N
should O
be O
placed O
in O
front N
of O
a O
monk H
so O
he O
can O
pick O
it O
up O
, O
or O
place N
it O
on O
a O
special O
cloth N
he O
carries O
with O
him O
. O

Monks H
will O
sometimes O
be O
aided O
by O
a O
layman H
who O
will O
accept O
things N
from O
women H
merit N
- O
makers H
on O
their O
behalf N
. O

Theravada O
Buddhist O
monks H
are O
also O
supposed O
to O
avoid O
material O
temptations N
and O
as O
such O
, O
are O
not O
allowed O
to O
touch O
money N
, O
so O
offering O
money N
to O
a O
monk H
is O
considered O
to O
be O
a O
sign N
of O
disrespect N
in O
most O
Theravada O
Buddhist O
cultures N
. O

Therefore O
, O
should O
you H
wish O
to O
donate O
to O
a O
monk H
, O
you H
should O
only O
offer O
food N
, O
and O
put O
your H
monetary O
donation N
in O
the O
appropriate O
donation N
box N
at O
the O
temple N
. O

Those O
monks H
that O
accept O
money N
are O
almost O
always O
fakes N

just O
a O

Get O
in O

Most O
travellers H
will O
arrive O
in O
York H
by O
road N
( O
car N
or O
bus N
) O
or O
rail N
from O
other O
parts N
of O
the O
UK O
or O
an O

By O

Although O
York H
is O
not O
directly O
on O
any O
of O
the O
main O
north O
- O
south O
motorways N
, O
the O
connections N
are O
reasonably O
good O
. O

From O
the O
south O
, O
the O
quickest O
route N
is O
probably O
to O
take O
the O
M1 O
northbound O
to O
junction N
32 O
, O
then O
take O
the O
M18 O
eastbound O
to O
junction N
2 O
, O
take O
the O
A1M O
northbound O
to O
junction N
44 O
and O
finally O
take O
the O
A64 O
eastbound O
to O
the O
York H
Outer O
Ring O
Road O
( O
A1237 O
) O
. O

Alternatively O
, O
you H
can O
take O
the O
M1 O
all O
the O
way N
to O
the O
A64 O
, O
but O
the O
upper O
reaches O
of O
the O
M1 O
around O
Sheffield O
and O
Leeds O
can O
get O
very O
congested O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
rush N
hours N
. O

From O
the O
west O
, O
the O
A59 O
and O
the O
M62 O
provide O
connections N
from O
Liverpool O

and O
from O
the O
north O
the O

and O
the O
A19 O
link N
York H
with O
Tyneside O
, O
Northumberland O
and O
south O

eastern O
Scotland O

Driving O
into O
the O
city N
centre N
itself O
is O
something O
to O
avoid O
. O

Traffic N
congestion N
on O
the O
main O
arterial O
roads N
serving O
the O
city N
( O
especially O
the O
A19 O
on O
Bootham O
and O
the O
Inner O
Ring O
Road O
) O
can O
get O
very O
bad O
, O
especially O
during O
the O
rush N
hours N
and O
on O
Saturday O
mornings N
. O

The O
remodelling O
of O
some O
roads N
near O
bottleneck N
junctions N
to O
accommodate O
bicycle N
lanes N
has O
made O
traffic N
jams N
even O
worse O
still O
in O
recent O
years N
, O
and O
parking O
in O
the O
city N
centre N
is O
very O
expensive O
. O

If O
you H
are O
just O
visiting O
York H
for O
the O
day N
, O
using O
a O
Park H
and O
Ride O
[ O
1 O
] O
costs O
a O
lot N
less O
than O
trying O
to O
park N
in O
or O
near O
the O
city N
centre N
, O
and O
there O
are O
five O
sites N
dotted O
around O
the O
Outer O
Ring O
Road O
. O

However O
, O
the O
last O
buses N
from O
the O
city N
centre N
leave O
at O
around O
8 O
pm O
in O
the O
evenings N
and O
you H
are O
not O
allowed O
to O
leave O
your H
car N
in O
a O
Park H
and O
Ride O
overnight O
. O

Therefore O
, O
if O
you H
are O
staying O
overnight O
in O
York H
and O
arriving O
by O
car N
, O
make O
sure O
that O
your H
hotel N
offers O
parking O
before O
you H
book O
. O

If O
you H
are O
only O
visiting O
for O
the O
day N
but O
staying O
until O
late O
evening N
, O
you H
will O
need O
to O
use H
a O

How O
to O
Detect O
Arrogant O
People N

Do O
you H
always O
seem O
to O
cross O
paths N
with O
people N
who O
are O
stuck O
on O
themselves O
, O
intolerant O
of O
people N
different O
from O
them O
, O
rude O
or O
downright O
arrogant O
? O

These O
people N
can O
be O
a O
great O
source N
of O
potential N
pain N
, O
and O
this O
article N
is O
here O
to O
help O
you H
sort N
the O
arrogant O
from O
the O
not O
- O
so O
- O
arrogant O
. O

Steps N

Pay O
attention N
to O
their O
conversations N
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
eavesdrop O
, O
but O
when O
they're O
they O
're O
talking O
to O
you H
or O
to O
those O
around O
you H
, O
listen O
to O
them O
. O

Is O
it O
always O
about O
them O
? O

Do O
they O
get O
mad O
or O
irritated O
if O
the O
centre N
of O
attention N
moves O
to O
someone H
else O
? O

These O
are O
good O
signs N
of O
arrogance N
. O

Arrogance N
and O
smugness N
is O
often O
a O
reflection N
of O
limited O
life N
experience N
, O
and O
feeling O
concerned O
that O
those O
with O
greater O
life N
experience N
" O
have O
got O
something O
over O
them O
" O
. O

Rather H
than O
seeking O
to O
find O
out H
more O
through O
questions N
and O
learning O
( O
actions N
viewed O
by O
them O
as O
showing O
vulnerability N
) O
, O
arrogant O
people N
tend O
to O
generalize O
from O
their O
limited O
, O
narrow O
life N
experiences N
and O
try O
to O
impose O
their O
small O
worldview O
on O
others O
. O

Jealousy N
of O
your H
achievements N
or O
seeming O
lifestyle N
can O
cause N
another O
person H
to O
feel O
smug O
or O
arrogant O
about O
something O
they O
think O
they O
do O
better O
than O
you H
or O
something O
they O
own O
/ O
have O
that O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
. O

Arrogant O
people N
have O
an O
extremely O
strong O
need O
to O
look O
good O
. O

When O
you H
make O
them O
look O
bad O
- O
even O
if O
it O
is O
the O
slightest O
offense N
- O
they O
will O
usually O
be O
very O
mad O
at O
you H
. O

This O
happens O
when O
you H
question N
( O
or O
at O
least O
seem O
to O
question N
) O
their O
appearance N
, O
intelligence N
, O
athletic O
abilities N
, O
or O
anything O
else O
relating O
to O
their O
self O
- O
image N
. O

Challenge O
their O
worldview O
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
be O
aggressive O
–– O
just O
skeptical O
and O
curious O
. O

If O
they O
get O
upset O
, O
gauge O
their O
anger N
. O

If O
it's O
it O
's H
minimal O
, O
they O
may O
be O
simply O
having O
a O
bad O
day N
. O

But O
if O
they're O
they O
're O
enraged O
, O
then O
they O
may O
see O
you H
as O
questioning O
their O
' O
perfect O
little O
world N
. O
' O

And O
having O
one N
of O
those O
is O
usually O
indicative O
of O
arrogance N
. O

At O
some O
point N
or O
another O
, O
most O
people N
realize O
that O
the O
world N
doesn't O
does O
n't O
revolve O
around O
them O
. O

Arrogant O
people N
counteract O
this O
by O
creating O
an O
atmosphere N
that O
revolves O
around O
them O
, O
and O
get O
angry O
if O
they're O
they O
're O
reminded O
of O
the O
real O
world N
. O

Ambiguity N
frightens O
arrogant O
people N
because O
it O
suggests O
imperfection N
, O
change O
and O
lack N
of O
certainty N
( O
realities N
we H
all O
must O
contend O
with O
as O
best O
we H
can O
) O
. O

As O
such O
, O
instead O
of O
accepting O
that O
the O
world N
behaves O
randomly O
and O
at O
times N
totally O
averse O
to O
one's O
one N
's H
preferences N
, O
the O
arrogant O
person H
seeks O
to O
control N
everything O
and O
everyone O
, O
which O
of O
course N
, O
is O
an O
impossible O
mission N
. O

Reality N
hurts O
when O
it O
intrudes O
; O
as O
such O
, O
an O
arrogant O
person H
is O
less O
likely O
than O
other O
people N
to O
self O
- O
reflect O
or O
analyse O
, O
thereby O
not O
seeing O
their O
own O
imperfections N
. O

They O
may O
also O
give O
themselves O
undue O
credit N
for O
positive N
achievements N
instead O
of O
acknowledging O
the O
input N
of O
others O
or O
of O
circumstances N
. O

Learn O
the O
quality N
of O
their O
friendships N
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
be O
nosy O
or O
gossipy O
, O
but O
if O
they O
are O
happy O
with O
someone H
one N
day N
and O
hateful O
with O
them O
the O
next O
, O
that's O
that O
's H
a O
sign N
of O
them O
having O
a O
lot N
of O
fair O
weather N
friends H
. O

That's O
That O
's H
a O
sign N
of O
arrogance N
, O
since O
it O
is O
very O
hard O
to O
be O
a O
truly O
good O
friend H
to O
someone H
who's O
who O
's H
stuck O
on O
themselves O
. O

Prideful O
people N
have O
a O
strong O
need O
to O
look O
good O
, O
and O
being O
self O
- O
sufficient O
is O
an O
effective O
way N
to O
do O
that O
. O

Since O
being O
a O
good O
friend H
to O
someone H
usually O
means N
helping O
them O
, O
they O
often O
can't O
ca O
n't O
stand O
the O
thought O
of O
a O
good O
friendship N
. O

Ironically O
, O
arrogant O
people N
often O
can't O
ca O
n't O
understand O
why O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
reliable O
and O
supportive O
friends H
. O

How O
do O
they O
treat O
those O
not O
like O
themselves O
? O

In O
other O
words N
, O
how O
do O
they O
treat O
those O
with O
different O
beliefs N
, O
cultural O
backgrounds N
and O
ways N
of O
seeing O
the O
world N
? O

If O
it's O
it O
's H
inherently O
negative O
, O
then O
they're O
they O
're O
either O
over O
- O
zealous O
, O
ignorant O
of O
other O
people N
or O
what O
to O
avoid O
those O
that O
contradict O
their O
fantasy N
land O
that O
caters O
to O
them O
and O
them O
only O
. O

Determine O
this O
based O
on O
their O
general O
personality N
and O
the O
people N
they're O
they O
're O
interacting O
with O
. O

Many O
times N
prideful O
people N
have O
a O
serious O
' O
my H
- O
way's O
way N
's H
- O
the O
- O
only O
- O
way N
' O
attitude N
. O

This O
is O
simply O
a O
protective O
mechanism N
for O
their O
false O
image N
or O
their O
fantasy N
land O
. O

What's O
What O
's H
their O
personality N
like O
? O

Take O
note N
of O
how O
they O
act N
, O
talk O
, O
and O
use H
their O
social O
status N
. O

Do O
they O
have O
a O
general O
sense N
of O
' O
coolness N
? O
' O

Are O
they O
a O
chatterbox A
? O

Do O
they O
act N
like O
they O
own O
the O
place N
, O
or O
act N
like O
the O
' O
big O
dog A
? O
' O

Are O
they O
very O
keen O
on O
their O
self O
- O
image N
? O

Many O
arrogant O
people N
have O
a O
false O
charm N
that O
no O
one N
seems O
to O
see O
through O
. O

But O
the O
arrogant O
person H
is O
usually O
more O
than O
happy O
to O
show O
their O
cruel O
side N
to O
those O
that O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
like O
. O

When O
they O
are O
cruel O
, O
their O
friends H
will O
usually O
ignore O
it O
or O
not O
do O
anything O
to O
stop N
it O
since O
they're O
they O
're O
afraid O
that O
they'll O
they O
'll O
be O
treated O
badly O
by O
their O
' O
friend H
. O
' O

Mention O
people N
you H
know O
that O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
like O
. O

This O
isn't O
is O
n't O
meant O
to O
begin O
a O
conflict N
, O
but O
to O
gauge O
their O
rivalries N
, O
annoyances N
and O
enmities N
. O

If O
their O
condemnation N
seems O
to O
be O
reasonable O
, O
they O
probably O
aren't O
are O
n't O
hubristic O
. O

If O
it's O
it O
's H
harsh O
, O
they O
are O
. O

For O
the O
most O
part N
, O
arrogant O
people N
see O
people N
that O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
like O
as O
threats N
to O
their O
perfect O
little O
world N
. O

The O
more O
they O
hate O
someone H
, O
the O
more O
dangerous O
that O
person H
is O
to O
their O
fantasy N
land O
. O

And O
in O
turn O
, O
the O
bigger O
the O
threat N
, O
the O
harsher O
the O
criticism N
. O

Ask O
around O
to O
see O
what O
they've O
they O
've O
been O
saying O
about O
you H
. O

If O
they O
have O
been O
saying O
bad O
things N
about O
you H
, O
they O
may O
simply O
not O
like O
you H
. O

If O
they're O
they O
're O
nice O
to O
your H
face N
, O
but O
talk O
bad O
about O
you H
behind O
your H
back O
like O
it's O
it O
's H
their O
favourite O
hobby N
, O
then O
they O
probably O
have O
a O
problem N
with O
pride N
. O

Arrogant O
people N
often O
subconsciously O
know O
that O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
good O
friends H
. O

They O
compensate O
for O
this O
by O
creating O
the O
impression N
that O
they O
have O
a O
lot N
of O
friends H
- O
they O
have O
a O
' O
quantity N
, O
not O
quality N

mentality N

Then O
they O
simply O
insult N

in O
the O
early O
1600's O
, O
and O
early O
forms N
of O
this O
elegant O

throughout O
their O
adult O
lives O
, O
making O
this O
technique N
the O
basis N
of O
training N
for O
all O
types N
of O
dance O
. O

While O
dancing N
ballet N
takes O
dedication N
and O
requires O
serious O
training N
, O
you H
can O
learn O
the O
basics N
to O
prepare O
yourself H
for O
further O
study O
. O

Learn O
to O
get O
ready O
for O
practicing O
, O
the O
basic O
positions N
, O
and O
some O
of O
the O

Part N
1 O
Getting O
Ready O
to O
Dance O

Stretch O
your H
muscles N
thoroughly O
. O

Stretching O
is O
important O
to O
loosen O
muscles N
, O
strengthen O
muscles N
and O
to O
elongate O
your H
posture N
. O

It O
is O
vital O
that O
it O
is O
done O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
each O
ballet N
session N
, O
including O
before O
a O
performance N
. O

When O
taking O
on O
ballet N
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
stretch O
daily O
for O
at O
least O
15 O
- O
30 O
minutes N
, O
to O
give O
the O
muscles N
ample O
opportunity N
to O
warm O
up O
, O
reducing O
the O
risk N
of O
injury N
. O

You H
should O
also O
stretch O
to O
" O
wind N
down O
" O
at O
the O
end N
of O
ballet N
dancing N
. O

Always O
wear O
ballet N
slippers N
. O

Properly O
- O
fitted O
ballet N
shoes N
should O
be O
snug O
, O
but O
not O
so O
tight O
they O
cut O
off O
blood N
flow N
and O
create O
numbness N
in O
the O
feet N
. O

There O
are O
different O
styles N
and O
types N
of O
shoes N
, O
so O
ask O
your H
ballet N
teacher H
or O
a O
salesman H
at O
the O
store N
for O
advice N
, O
given O
your H
intentions N
for O
dancing N
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
buy O
shoes N
to O
grow O
into O
, O
because O
your H
feet N
will O
seem O
flexed O
when O
you H
pointe O
and O
will O
look O
flat O
. O

You H
should O
fit O
them O
to O
where O
the O
drawstring N
is O
tied O
slightly O
loose O
. O

If O
your H
drawstring N
is O
longer O
than O
your H
pinkie N
then O
you H
should O
cut O
it O
off O
till O
it O
is O
roughly O
the O
size N
of O
your H
fingernail N
. O

The O
drawstring N
just O
completes O
the O
fit O
. O

It O
isn't O
is O
n't O
made O
to O
tighten O
overly O
large O
shoes N
. O

If O
you H
can't O
ca O
n't O
buy O
ballet N
shoes N
, O
that O
it O
is O
okay O
. O

Use O
socks N
without O
the O
stickies O
on O
the O
bottom N
, O
so O
you H
can O
turn O
! O

Wear O
comfortable O
and O
snug O
- O
fitting O
athletic O
clothes N
. O

The O
most O
important O
thing N
is O
that O
you H
are O
comfortable O
, O
and O
that O
you're H
you H
're O
not O
wearing O
baggy O
or O
loose O
fitting O
clothing N
so O
you H
can O
make O
sure O
you're H
you H
're O
forming O
and O
moving O
correctly O
in O
the O
mirror N
. O

A H
plain O
black O
leotard N
and O
pink O
tights O
are O
usually O
a O
safe O
bet N
. O

Pink O
or O
black O
ballet N
slippers N
are O
also O
appropriate O
. O

If O
you're H
you H
're O
signed O
up O
for O
a O
class N
, O
check O
with O
your H
instructor H
to O
find O
out H
if O
there O
is O
a O
dress O
code N
at O
the O
school N
. O

Some O
schools N
may O
have O
students H
wear O
the O
same O
thing N
and O
others O
may O
just O
require O
any O
type N
of O
leotard N
and O
tights O
and O
sometimes O
ballet N
skirts N
. O

Mostly O
they O
require O
tight O
fitting O
clothing N
so O
they O
can O
see O
that O
your H
muscles N
are O
working O
properly O
and O
so O
on O
. O

Find O
an O
appropriate O
space N
to O
practice O
. O

Ballet N
is O
less O
about O
learning O
the O
moves O
and O
more O
about O
perfecting O
them O
. O

The O
moves O
themselves O
are O
relatively O
straightforward O
, O
but O
the O
positing N
, O
the O
timing N
, O
and O
the O
elegance N
required O
takes O
a O
lifetime N
of O
practice O
. O

For O
this O
reason N
, O
it's O
it O
's H
always O
better O
to O
practice O
ballet N
in O
a O
ballet N
studio N
under O
the O
guidance N
of O
a O
good O
instructor H
, O
who O
will O
be O
able O
to O
correct O
your H
positioning N
and O
make O
sure O
that O
you're H
you H
're O
dancing N
properly O
. O

A H
dancing N
studio N
is O
equipped O
with O
mirrors N
for O
correcting O
your H
positioning N
and O
seeing O
what O
you're H
you H
're O
doing O
accurately O
, O
and O
a O
barre O
for O
practicing O
. O
[ O

] O

If O
you H
want O
to O
practice O
at O
home N
, O
make O
sure O
you've O
you H
've O
got O
enough O
open O
space N
to O
move O
freely O
, O
preferably O
on O
a O
hard O
wood N
floor N
. O

The O
back O
of O
a O
chair N
can O
replace O
the O
need O
for O
a O
bar N
. O

Position O
a O
large O
mirror N
so O
you H
can O
check O
your H
positioning N
and O
see O
what O
you're H
you H
're O
doing O

How O
to O
Grow O
Basil A

Three O
Methods N
: O
Starting N
Seeds N
Caring O
for O
Basil A
Harvesting O
and O
Using O
Basil A

Basil A
is O
easy O
to O
grow O
, O
and O
transforms O
ordinary O
meals N
into O
culinary O
treasures N
! O

Fresh O
basil A
not O
only O
tastes O
better O
than O
dried O
, O
it O
actually O
tastes O
different O
, O
almost O
as O
if O
it O
were O
not O
the O
same O
herb N
. O

This O
article N
outlines O
how O
to O
plant A
and O
harvest O
basil A
. O

Method N
1 O
of O
3 O
: O
Starting N
Seeds N

1 O
Choose O
the O
kind N
of O
basil A
you H
wish O
to O
grow O
. O

Basil A
comes O
in O
many O
different O
varieties N
, O
each O
of O
which O
have O
a O
unique O
flavor N
and O
smell O
. O

Read O
up O
on O
different O
types N
of O
basil A
and O
pick O
out H
one N
- O
or O
several O
- O
that O
appeal O
to O
you H
, O
then O
order O
the O
seeds N
or O
buy O
them O
at O
a O
garden N
store N
. O

Here O
are O
a O
few O
ideas N
: O

Cinnamon N
basil A
really O
does O
smell O
like O
the O
sweet O
spice N
, O
and O
it O
also O
has O
unusually O
beautiful O
and O
fragrant O
flowers A
. O

Lemon N
basil A
actually O
contains O
citral O
, O
an O
aromatic O
compound N
found O
in O
citrus O
fruit N
, O
and O
smells O
very O
lemony O
. O

Purple O
basil A
is O
often O
grown O
for O
decoration N
, O
as O
well O
as O
its O
scent N
and O
flowers A
. O

There O
are O
perennial O
basils A
which O
come O
back O
year N
after O
year N
, O
like O
African O
Blue O
Basil A
( O
which O
has O
pretty O
blue O
veins N
on O
its O
leaves N
) O
and O
Thai O
Basil A
, O
while O
most O
other O
varieties N
are O
annuals A
, O
which O
you'll O
you H
'll O
have O
to O
plant A
year N
after O
year N
. O

Globe N
and O
Greek O
basil A
are O
much O
more O
difficult O
to O
grow O
, O
but O
form N
pretty O
little O
bushes A
which O
stay O
well O
- O
contained O
. O

2 O
Start O
seed N
indoors O
four O
to O
six O
weeks N
before O
last O
frost N
. O

Basil A
needs N
warm O
air N
and O
sun N
to O
do O
well O
, O
so O
it's O
it O
's H
often O
easiest O
to O
start O
the O
seeds N
indoors O
instead O
of O
risking O
that O
they'll O
they O
'll O
get O
damaged O
by O
frost N
. O

If O
you H
live O
in O
a O
hot O
climate N
, O
you H
can O
start O
the O
seeds N
outside O
instead O
. O

To H
figure O
out H
when O
the O
last O
frost N
will O
be O
, O
consult O
an O
almanac N
or O
talk O
with O
other O
gardeners H
in O
your H
area N
. O

3 O
Prepare O
seed N
containers N
. O

Fill O
flats N
or O
individual O
seed N
containers N
with O
a O
mixture N
of O
equal O
parts N
perlite O
, O
vermiculite N
, O
and O
peat N
. O

Press O
the O
mixture N
slightly O
to O
eliminate O
air N
pockets N
. O

Dampen O
the O
mixture N
with O
water N
so O
it's O
it O
's H
ready O
to O
provide O
the O
right O
environment N
for O
the O
basil A
seeds N
to O
germinate O
. O

4 O
Plant H
the O
seeds N
. O

Drop O
one N
to O
two O
seeds N
into O
each O
container N
. O

Cover O
them O
lightly O
with O
soil N
. O

Cover O
containers N
with O
clear N
plastic N
kitchen N
wrap N
, O
so O
they O
stay O
moist O
. O

Leave O
the O
containers N
in O
a O
sunny O
window N
. O

Twice O
daily O
, O
remove O
the O
plastic N
wrap N
and O
sprinkle O
the O
containers N
with O
more O
water N
. O

5 O
Remove O
the O
plastic N
wrap N
when O
the O
sprouts N
emerge O
. O

When O
you H
see O
the O
first O
green O
tendrils N
push O
up O
through O
the O
soil N
, O
it's O
it O
's H
time N
to O
remove O
the O
plastic N
wrap N
. O

Keep O
watering O
the O
sprouts N
twice O
daily O
, O
never O
letting O
the O
soil N
dry H
out H
. O

When O
the O
plants A
become O
a O
few O
inches N
tall O
and O
their O
leaves N
mature O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
time N
to O
transplant O
them O
to O
a O
larger O
container N
. O

Method N
2 O
of O
3 O
: O
Caring O
for O
Basil A

1 O
Transplant O
the O
basil A
plants A
. O

Once O
two O
sets N
of O
leaves N
have O
formed O
, O
basil A
can O
be O
planted O
into O
the O
garden N
or O
permanent O
containers N
. O

Basil A
does O
not O
tolerate O
frost N
so O
don't O
do O
n't O
plant A
too O
early O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
best O
to O
put O
basil A
somewhere O
where O
it O
will O
get O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
sunshine N
and O
have O
well O
- O
drained O
soil N
. O

To H
plant A
the O
basil A
in O
the O
garden N
, O
dig O
holes N
spaced O
at O
least O
6 O
inches N
apart O
. O

Place N
the O
roots N
in O
the O
holes N
and O
place N
soil N
around O
the O
stems N
. O

Pat H
down O
soil N
around O
the O
plants A
to O
eliminate O
air N
pockets N
. O

If O
you H
want O
to O
plant A
the O
basil A
in O
a O
container N
, O
make O
sure O
it's O
it O
's H
large O
enough O
to O
accommodate O
the O
number N
of O
plants A
you're H
you H
're O
growing O
; O

they O
need O
to O
be O
planted O
6 O
inches N
apart O
, O
since O
they O
grow O
quite O
large O
. O

2 O
Keep O
the O
soil N
damp O
, O
but O
not O
soaked O
. O

Basil A
does O
best O
in O
well O
- O
drained O
soil N
, O
and O
should O
not O
be O
subjected O
to O
standing N
water N
. O

Water N
the O
mature O
basil A
plants A
once O
a O
day N
, O
in O
the O
morning N
, O
so O
the O
water N
has O
time N
to O
soak O
in O
and O
evaporate O
rather O
than O
sitting O
on O
the O
plants A
overnight O
. O

3 O
Pinch N
off O
flower A
heads N
. O

When O
you H
see O
flower A
buds N
, O
pinch N
them O
and O
two O
pairs N
of O
leaves N
under O
them O
off O
. O

Flowers A
blooming O
create O
a O
hormone N
change O
which O
dramatically O
reduces O
the O
flavor N
of O
the O
leaves N
, O
as O
well O
as O
reducing O
the O
amount N
of O
foliage N
which O
grows O
. O

This O
is O
called O
" O
bolting O
" O
and O
is O
more O
likely O
to O
happen O
when O
there's O
there O
's H
extra O
sunshine N
. O

You'll O
You H
'll O
notice O
that O
if O
you H
leave O
the O
flowers A
, O
the O
plant A
will O
become O
lanky O
and O
the O
leaves N
won't O
wo O
n't O
be O
as O
full O
or O
tasty O
. O

4 O
Watch O
for O
pests N
and O
mold N
. O

Basil A
plants A
are O
attractive O
to O
Japanese O
beetles A

the O
best O
way N
to O
control N
these O
pests N
is O
to O
pick O
them O
off O
the O
plants A
by O
hand N
. O

If O
your H
plants A
show O
signs N
of O
mold N
growth N
, O
they O
may O
not O
be O
getting O
adequate O
sunlight N
, O
or O
they O
may O
be O
too O
close O
together O
. O

Weed O
out H
the O
smaller O
plants A
to O
give O
the O
larger O
ones N
more O
space N
. O

Method N
3 O
of O
3 O
: O
Harvesting O
and O
Using O
Basil A

1 O
Harvest O
and O
prune O
. O

As O
the O
plant A
matures O
, O
pinch N
off O
the O
top N
two O
pairs N
of O
leaves N
once O
a O
stalk N
reaches O
a O
reasonable O
height N
. O

If O
you H
look O
closely O
, O
at O
the O
base N
of O
every O
leaf N
are O
two O
tiny O
little O
leaves N
that O
will O
grow O
outwards O
if O
the O
stem O
growing O
between O
them O
is O
cut O
off O
. O

Cut O
close O
to O
those O
tiny O
leaves N
, O
but O
be O
sure O
not O
to O
damage N
them O
. O

Pinching O
encourages O
the O
plant's O
plant A
's H
energy N
to O
be O
directed O
into O
its O
stronger O
stems N
and O
leaves N
. O

This O
helps O
the O
plants A
grow O
bushy O
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
pinch N
on O
the O
lower O
part N
of O
the O
stem O
, O
or O
the O
basil A
plants A
will O
grow O
tall O
and O
reedy O
. O

You H
want O
them O
to O
get O
bushy O
, O
so O
pinch N
from O
the O
top N
. O

2 O
Enjoy O
the O
basil A
fresh O
. O

Rinse O
off O
the O
leaves N
and O
use H
the O
basil A
to O
make O
pesto N
or O
a O
Caprese O
salad N
with O
tomatoes N
and O
fresh O
mozzarella N
cheese N
. O

3 O
Store O
the O
basil A
in O
the O
refrigerator N
. O

You'll O
You H
'll O
probably O
have O
more O
basil A
than O
you H
could O
possibly O
eat O
fresh O
, O
so O
plan N
on O
storing O
some O
in O
the O
fridge N
. O

Wash O
the O
leaves N
, O
dry H
them O
well O
, O
and O
wrap N
them O
in O
paper N
towels N
. O

Place N
them O
in O
a O
food N
storage N
container N
with O
an O
airtight O
lid N
. O

4 O
Freeze O
the O
basil A
. O

Freezing O
the O
leaves N
whole O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
work N
very O
well O
, O
but O
if O
you H
puree O
it O
first O
you H
can O
freeze O
it O
for O
months N
. O

Place N
the O
basil A
in O
a O
blender N
with O
a O
little O
water N
. O

Puree O
it O
until O
smooth O
, O
then O
put O
it O
in O
a O
food N
storage N
bag N
and O
freeze O
until O
you H
need O
it O
. O

How O
to O
Hypnotize O
a O
Chicken N

Anyone O
who's O
who O
's H
spent O
a O
lot N
of O
time N
on O
a O
farm N
with O
chickens N
is O
probably O
familiar O
with O
this O
trick N
. O

Those O
who've O
who O
've O
never O
heard O
of O
this O
will O
be O
amazed O
to O
see O
a O
chicken N
lie O
perfectly O
still O
after O
these O
instructions N
are O
followed O
. O

Biologists H
think O
that O
fear N
causes N
this O
" O
hypnosis N
, O
" O
which O
may O
be O
an O
attempt N
to O
" O
play O
dead O
" O
to O
fool H
predators A
. O

Method N
One O
of O
Two O
: O
Hypnotizing O
a O
Chicken N

Hold O
the O
chicken N
down O
on O
a O
flat O
surface N
. O

Hold O
the O
chicken N
with O
one N
hand N
supporting O
the O
breast N
. O

Place N
it O
down O
so O
that O
its O
breast N
is O
carrying O
its O
weight N
and O
rests O
on O
the O
ground N
. O

Continue O
to O
hold O
its O
feet N
so O
the O
grand O
experiment O
can O
continue O
. O

You H
can O
place N
the O
chicken N
on O
its O
breast N
instead O
. O

Press O
gently O
down O
on O
its O
back O
, O
and O
gently O
move O
its O
legs N
back O
if O
it O
tries O
to O
stand O
up O
. O

Wiggle O
your H
finger N
. O

Hold O
the O
bird A
down O
gently O
with O

Reducing O
Stress N
in O
the O
Chicken N

Understand O
the O
hypnotic O
effect N
. O

Researchers H
call O
this O
effect N
" O
tonic O
immobility N
" O
. O

" O
When O
a O
chicken N
or O
another O
animal A
with O
this O
tendency N
becomes O
frightened O
, O
its O
heart N
rate N
lowers O
and O
it O
stops N
moving O
. O

This O
may O
be O
an O
attempt N
to O
play O
dead O
, O
discouraging O
predators A
that O
prefer O
live O
prey A
. O

Unlike O
an O
opossum A
, O
the O
chicken N
gives O
an O
unconvincing O
act N
, O
as O
it O
continues O
to O
blink O
and O
breathe O
in O
an O
obvious O
way N
. O
" O

Keep O
the O
chicken N
upright O
or O
on O
its O
side N
. O

While O
it's O
it O
's H
not O
uncommon O
to O
transport N
a O
chicken N
by O
its O
feet N
, O
this O
upside N
- O
down O
hold O
risks N
breaking O
the O
chicken's O
chicken N

Hypnosis N
techniques N
that O
involve O
laying N
a O
chicken N
on O
its O
back O
may O
" O
succeed O
" O
by O
cutting N
off O
its O
air N
supply N
. O

This O
can O
cause N
the O
chicken N
significant O
discomfort N
, O
leading N
to O
fainting O
or O
even O
, O
rarely O
, O
death N
. O

Keep O
hypnosis N
short O
and O
infrequent O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
not O
completely O
clear N
how O
much O
stress N
this O
hypnosis N
causes N
. O

Even O
if O
it O
does O
, O
the O
chicken N
shouldn't O
should O
n't O
suffer O
as O
long O
as O
you H
let O
it O
go O
soon O
afterward O
. O

Hours N
of O
stress N
, O
or O
regular O
exposure N
to O
stressful O
situations N
, O
can O
cause N
serious O
health N
problems N
. O

Get O
your H
chickens N
used O
to O
humans A
and O
novelty N
. O

Even O
prolonged O
eye N
contact O
seems O
to O
have O
an O
effect N
. O

Living O
in O
stimulating O
environments N
with O
new O
objects N
may O
also O
help O
. O

Hens A
raise O
in O
battery N
cages N
stay O
" O
hypnotized O
" O
longer O
, O
possibly O
because O
of O
greater O
fear N
. O

Watch O
for O
signs N
of O
stress N

Abnormal O
feathering N
, O
constant O
preening O
, O
or O
delays N
in O
egg A

laying N
are O
all O
signs N
of O
a O

While O
hypnotizing O
is O
unlikely O
to O
cause N
serious O
harm O

any O
type N

Tips N

You H
can O
add O
pureed O
fruit N
for O
delicious O
flavor N
changes N
. O

One O
small O
container N
of O
pureed O
fruit N
is O
sufficient O
for O
flavoring N
( O
the O
little O
containers N
that O
children H
take O
to O
school N
in O
their O
lunchboxes O
. O
) O

Try O
strawberry N
, O
apple N
, O
banana A
, O
apricot A
, O
peach N
etc. O

The O
cupcakes N
will O
not O
be O
as O
light N
and O
fluffy O
, O
however O
, O
so O
be O
prepared O
for O
a O
heavier O
cupcake N
if O
you H
add O
fruit N
but O
the O
added O
moisture N
content N
is O
a O
definite O
plus O
. O

Instead O
of O
using O
vegan O
sugar N
, O
you H
can O
replace O
it O
with O
equal O
parts N
maple N
sugar N
or O
rice N
syrup N

Instead O
of O
using O
vegetable N
oil N
, O
try O
substituting O
it O
for O
walnut N
or O
macadamia A
nut N
oils N
if O
they O
are O
available O
to O
you H
. O

Coconut N
oil N
also O
produces O
good O
results N
. O

And O
olive N
oil N
works O
fine O
if O
it's O
it O
's H
all O
that's O
that O
's H
left O
in O
the O
pantry N
. O

You H
can O
replace O
the O
plain O
soy N
milk N
with O
other O
flavors N
like O
chocolate N
or O
vanilla N
if O
you H
want O
to O
experiment O
with O
changing O
the O
flavor N
of O
the O
cupcakes N

Experiment O
with O
the O
flavors N

How O
to O
Annoy O
People N
in O
Elevators N

An O
elevator N
is O
almost O
the O
perfect O
environment N
to O
be O
a O
prankster H
. O

It’s O
It O
’s H
easy O
to O
annoy O
people N
when O
you H
are O
cramped O
in O
such O
a O
small O
, O
tight O
space N
. O

Because O
elevator N
rides N
usually O
last O
less O
than O
a O
minute O
, O
make O
sure O
your H
pranks N
are O
quick O
and O
have O
a O
lot N
of O
punch N
. O

When O
annoying O
people N
on O
an O
elevator N
, O
keep O
your H
pranks N
lighthearted O
and O
fun O
as O
opposed O
to O
mean O

spirited O
so O
that O
everyone O
leaving O
the O

If O
you H
want O
to O

it O
a O
step O
further O

when O
no O
one N
gets O
off O
at O
the O
floors N
you H
pushed O
. O
[ O

floor N
, O
say O

like O
notes N
in O
a O
scale N
, O
getting O
higher O
as O
you H
reach O
each O
new O
floor N
. O
[ O

You H
can O
make O
other O
noises N
if O

prefer O
, O
such O
as O
a O
bird A
cawing O
or O
an O
explosion N
sound N
every O
time N
a O
button N
is O
pushed O
. O

Talk O
to O
your H
reflection N
in O
the O
mirror N
. O

Many O
elevators N
have O
mirrors N
on O
the O
walls N
. O

A H
great O
way N
to O
be O
mischievous O
in O
an O
elevator N
is O
to O
carry O
on O
a O
running O
commentary N
while O
you H
look O
at O
yourself H
in O
the O
mirror N
. O

You H
could O
look O
at O
yourself H
, O
turning O
to O
catch O
different O
angles N
and O
say O
“ O
All O
right O
, O
all O
right O
, O
now O
we’re O
we H
’re O
talking O
, O
” O
very O
loudly O
. O

You H
could O
also O
keep O
adjusting O
your H
shirt N
or O
your H
hair N
, O
keeping N
a O
running O
dialogue N
about O
what O
look O
is O
best O
for O
you H
. O

Stand O
in O
the O
corner N
of O
the O
elevator N
facing O
the O
wall N
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
say O
anything O
the O
whole O
ride O
. O

Dance O
to O
the O
elevator N
music N
. O

Many O
elevators N
play O
music N
in O
the O
background N
, O
usually O
soft O
rock N
or O
smooth O
jazz N
. O

If O
you’re O
you H
’re O
in O
an O
elevator N
that O
is O
playing O
music N
, O
start O
to O
dance O
. O

Start O
just O
bobbing O
your H
head N
and O
tapping O
your H
feet N
, O
and O
then O
get O
your H
whole O
body N
into O
it O
. O

Take O
up O
as O
much O
space N
as O
you H
can O
to O
dance O
until O
everyone O
is O
staring O
at O
you H

. O

At O
every O
floor N
, O
make O
a O
loud O
announcement N
telling O
everyone O
the O
floor N
number N
. O

Say O
something O
like O
“ O
Everyone O
going O
to O
floor N
ten O
, O
get O
off O
now O
! O
No O
time N
to O
dilly O
dally O
! O
” O
[ O

] O

You H
can O
also O
pretend O
to O
conduct O
people N
onto O
the O
elevator N
, O
saying O
“ O
All O
aboard O
the O
elevator N
train N
! O
” O

Exclaim O

When O
the O

as O
the O
doors N

, O
exclaim O
that O
you H
lost O
your H
tarantula A
/ O
snake A
/ O
scorpion H
but O
confirm O
that O
it O
is O
somewhere O
in O
the O
elevator N
. O

Most O
people N
will O
probably O
see O
that O
this O
is O
a O
joke N
. O

However O
, O
if O
somebody H
looks O
seriously O
alarmed O
or O
is O
starting O
to O
panic O
, O
let O
them O
know O
that O
you H
were O
not O
being O
serious O
. O

Build O
in O
or O
add O
something O
to O
the O
elevator N
. O

For O
example N
, O
build O
a O
Lego O
city N
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
elevator N
. O

Lay H
a O
Twister N
mat N
on O
the O
floor N
and O
ask O
people N
if O
they O
want O
to O
play O
. O

Talk O
to O
people N

When O
there O
are O
a O
lot N
of O
people N

say O
, O
" O
You're O

Flirting N
Dos N

Start O
the O
conversation N
casually O
. O

As O
in O
the O
real O
world N
, O
the O
first O
step O
to O
flirting N
is O
to O
get O
over O
your H
cold O
feet N
and O
jump N
right O
in O
! O

Text O
the O
other O
person H
a O
brief N
message N
asking O
them O
about O
their O
day N
, O
asking O
them O
a O
specific O
question N
about O
work N
or O
school N
, O
or O
simply O
saying O
" O
Hi O
! O
" O
. O

The O
hardest O
part N
of O
flirting N
is O
to O
break O
through O
your H
initial O
reluctance N
, O
so O
if O
you're H
you H
're O
having O
a O
hard O
time N
taking O
the O
plunge N
, O
just O
remind O
yourself H
that O
no O
matter N
how O
badly O
it O
goes O
, O
it'll O
it O
'll O
be O
less O
stressful O
than O
an O
equivalent N
real O
- O
world N
encounter N
. O

There's O
There O
's H
no O
reason N
to O
be O
nervous O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
IM O
flirting N
— O

if O
the O
person H
you H
want O
to O
talk O
to O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
want O
to O
talk O
to O
you H
, O
s/he O
always O
has O
the O
option N
of O
simply O
not O
responding O
to O
your H
message N
, O
as O
, O
from O
your H
point N
of O
view N
, O
this O
is O
indistinguishable O
from O
him O
or O
her O
simply O
being O
away O
from O
the O
computer N
. O

This O
being O
said O
, O
if O
you H
barely O
know O
someone H
, O
it O
can O
be O
a O
good O
idea N
to O
have O
an O
excuse O
for O
starting O
a O
conversation N
to O
avoid O
awkwardness N
. O

Asking O
for O
help O
with O
a O
work N
or O
school N
- O
related O
problem N
is O
almost O
always O
a O
good O
bet N
, O
as O
is O
asking O
a O
question N
about O
something O
striking O
about O
the O
person H
. O

For O
instance N
, O
if O
the O
person H
has O
a O
band N
- O
related O
username O
, O
you H
might O
say O
: O
" O
Hey O
, O
cool O
name N
. O
Did O
you H
see O
those O
guys H
when O
they O
last O
came O
to O
town N
? O
" O

Start O
small O
talk O
. O

After O
your H
initial O
greeting N
and O
exchange O
of O
pleasantries N
, O
you'll O
you H
'll O
probably O
want O
to O
ask O
how O
the O
person's O
person H
's H
doing O
( O
just O
like O
you H
might O
in O
the O
real O
world N
) O
. O

Ask O
him O
or O
her O
about O
work N
or O
school N
, O
his O
/ O
her O
interests N
, O
or O
any O
recent O
trips N
, O
for O
instance N
. O

Rather H
than O
asking O
a O
question N
, O
you H
can O
also O
simply O
offer O
your H
comments N
on O
these O
things N
. O

When O
s/he O
responds O
, O
add O
your H
own O
comments N
or O
ask O
follow O
- O
up O
questions N
and O
proceed O
from O
there O
! O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
pry O
into O
his O
or O
her O
personal O
life N
— O
keep O
things N
light N
, O
fun O
, O
and O
focused O
on O
worry O
- O
free O
subjects N
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
dwell O
too O
long O
on O
small O
talk O
. O

A H
minute O
or O
two O
is O
great O
for O
breaking O
the O
ice N
, O
but O
much O
more O
can O
get O
boring O
fast O
. O

For O
example N
, O
after O
we've O
we H
've O
opened O
up O
by O
asking O
about O
this O
person's O
person H
's H
interest N
in O
the O
band N
in O
his O
/ O
her O
username O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
logical O
and O
reasonable O
to O
ask O
about O
this O
person's O
person H
's H
musical N
likes O
and O
dislikes N
. O

You H
can O
even O
offer O
your H
own O
opinions N
and O
suggestions N
. O

For O
instance N
, O
you H
might O
say O
something O
like O
: O
" O
If O
you H
like O
those O
guys H
, O
you H
might O
want O
to O
check O
out H
this O
band N
called O
Manic O
Albatross O
- O
they're O
they O
're O
like O
the O
Beatles O
, O
only O
darker O

sorts N

Everyone O

a O

sense N

In O
the O

words N

" O
If O
you H

you H
can O

don't O
do O
n't O
worry O
, O
ladies H
— O
the O
same O
is O
true O
for O
men H
! O
) O

Try O
to O
be O
playful O
and O
even O
slightly O
sarcastic O
as O
you H
respond O
to O
the O
statements N
of O
the O
person H
you're H
you H
're O
talking O

For O
instance N
, O
if O
you're H
you H
're O
asked O
what O
you're H
you H
're O
up O

rather O
than O

looking O

hit O
on O
on O

" O
you H
might O
find O
that O
it's O
it O
's H
a O
better O
idea N

give O
a O
sarcastic O
answer N
like O
" O
writing N
the O
great O

These O

have O
the O
added O
benefit N

being O
natural O
launching N
points O
for O

Flirting N
Don'ts O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
be O
too O
self O
- O
deprecating O
. O

Simply O
put O
, O
confidence N
is O
sexy O
. O

This O
is O
more O
true O
for O
real O
- O
life N
situations N
than O
it O
is O
true O
online O
, O
but O
this O
mantra N
has O
some O
truth N
in O
the O
world N
of O
IM O
flirting N
as O
well O
. O

For O
instance N
, O
you'll O
you H
'll O
want O
to O
avoid O
making O
lots N
of O
jokes N
at O
your H
own O
expense N
. O

Just O
one N
is O
plenty O
— O
it O
shouldn't O
should O
n't O
be O
a O
recurring O
theme N
throughout O
your H
conversation N
. O

Doing O
this O
too O
often O
can O
quickly O
turn O
an O
otherwise O
flirtatious O
conversation N
into O
one N
in O
which O
you H
appear O
needy O
and O
self O
- O
loathing N
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand N
, O
this O
isn't O
is O
n't O
to O
say O
that O
you H
should O
necessarily O
make O
jokes N
at O
other O
people's O
people N
's H
expense N
, O
as O
this O
can O
make O
you H
seem O
mean O
and O
petty O
. O

Any O
sort N
of O
pointed O
or O
caustic O
remarks N
about O
yourself H
or O
someone H
else O
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
place N
in O
flirtatious O
conversations N

Don't O
Do O
n't O
be O
too O
sappy O
. O

People N
like O
flirting N
to O
be O
fun O
. O

For O
most O
people N
, O
receiving O
compliments N
is O
only O
fun O
up O
to O
a O
point N
— O
getting O
more O
than O
one N
or O
two O
can O
make O
someone H
feel O
embarrassed O
and O
self O
- O
conscious O
. O

It O
can O
also O
make O
him O
or O
her O
question N
your H
motives N
, O
leading N
the O
person H
to O
believe O
that O
you H
may O
be O
trying O
to O
get O
something O
out H
of O
him O
or O
her O
. O

Besides O
, O
the O
wooing O
power N
of O
flowery O
, O
gushing O
compliments N
is O
diminished O
( O
to O
say O
the O
least O
) O
when O
the O
compliments N
are O
displayed O
in O
a O
tiny O
box N
at O
the O
bottom N
of O
the O
screen N
alongside O
cartoon N
smiley O
faces N
. O

Instead O
of O
relying O
too O
heavily O
on O
compliments N
, O
instead O
, O
focus O
on O
having O
an O
engaging O
, O
genuine O
conversation N
. O

Follow O
the O
mantra N
" O
show O
, O
don't O
do O
n't O
tell O
. O
" O

In O
other O
words N
, O
show O
that O
you're H
you H
're O
attracted O
to O
this O
person H
by O
giving O
him O
or O

a O
great O

How O
to O
Make O
a O
Glowstick O

Those O
glowing O
Mountain O

videos N

all O
hoaxes N

To H
truly O
make O

glowstick O
without O

an O
already O

made O

shoving O
its O
contents N

of O

In O

wear O
gloves N

It O

also O
a O
good O
idea N

Throw O
on O
some O
old O
clothes N

put O
a O
smock N

Some O
of O
this O
stuff N

this O

Listen O
up O

You'll O

that's O
that O
's H
near O
a O
12 O
on O
the O
pH N
scale N

That O
basically O
means N
don't O
do O
n't O
swallow O
it O
, O
don't O
do O
n't O
put O
it O
in O
your H
eyes N
, O
don't O
do O
n't O
bathe O
in O
it O
, O
and O
don't O
do O
n't O
really O
expose O
yourself H
to O
it O
directly O
at O
all O

Combine O
50 O
milliliters N
of O
hydrogen N
peroxide N
and O
a O
liter N
of O
distilled O
water N
in O
a O
mixing O
bowl N
. O

A H
ceramic O
bowl N
will O
work N
best O
, O
but O
plastic N
works O
too O
. O

Use O
funnels N
, O
measuring O
tubes N
, O
and O
basters H
to O
keep O
everything O
well O
- O
measured O
and O
well O

Hydrogen N

is O
used O
to O
replace O
the O

nitrogen N
atoms N
with O
oxygen N
. O

When O
that O
happens O
, O
all O
the O
substances N
create O
a O
rave N

what O

It O
is O
important O
not O
to O
touch O
the O
luminol O
. O

Use O
a O
funnel N
to O
make O
everything O
safe O
and O
easy O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
these O
hazardous O
chemicals N
will O
not O
float O
freely O
in O
mid-air O
like O
this O
graphic N

Yep O
, O
unless O
you're H
you H
're O
a O
coroner H
or O
some O
sort N
of O
crazy O
spy H

criminologist H
you H
probably O
don't O
do O

have O
this O
stuff N
lying O
around O
the O
house N
( O
hopefully O
not O
... O
) O

If O
you're H
you H
're O
dead O
set O

starting O
your H

use H

of O
some O
sort N

Clean O
the O

dry H
them O

It's O
It O

important O
to O
use H
sanitary O
, O
clean O
tubes N
for O
your H
glowsticks O
. O

The O
last O
thing N
you H
want O
is O

the O
reactions N

make O
the O

Set O
the O

This O
enables O

to O
seal O
the O

quickly O
after O
filling O

It's O
It O

not O
like O
the O

get O
up O

still O

Combine O
equal O

close O
the O

Then O
turn O
off O
the O
lights N

If O
it's O
it O

not O
already O
glowing O

something O
went O
wrong O

Do O
over O

The O

doesn't O
does O
n't O
last O
long O
at O
all O

maybe O
a O
couple N
of O
minutes N

For O
something O
that O
lasts O
hours N
, O
go O
to O
the O
next O
method N
( O
which O
is O
a O
lot N
easier O
to O
facilitate O
if O
you H

it's O

Method N
2 O
of O
2 O
: O
Using O
Grammar N

Name O
your H
language N
. O

This O
is O
the O
most O
fundamental O
property N
in O
all O
languages N
. O

You H
have O
many O
names N
to O
choose O
from O
. O

You H
can O
even O
use H
a O
made O
up O
word N
from O
your H
made O
up O
language N
like O
' O
Victory O
' O
or O
' O
Great H
Language N
' O
. O

The O
choice N
is O
all O
yours H
. O

Start O
off O
with O
the O
highly O
frequently O
used O
words N
such O
as O
' O
and O
' O
or O
' O
I H
' O
or O
' O
one N
' O
or O
' O
the O
' O
. O

It O
is O
recommend O
that O
you H
use H
short O
words N
since O
they O
are O
commonly O
used O
. O

An O
example N
would O
be O
' O
ant O
' O
for O
and O
or O
' O
es O
' O
or O
even O
' O
loo O
' O
for O
the O
word N
' O
and O
' O
. O

Start O
thinking O
about O
the O
grammar N
rules N
. O

For O
example N
if O
the O
word N
Bird A
is O
' O
Vogelaviatiolap O
' O
then O
why O
not O
make O
the O
word N
Birds A
' O
Vogelaviatiolaps O
' O
since O
the O
suffix N
' O
s H
' O
is O
added O
at O
the O
end N
for O
most O
languages N
at O
plurals N
. O

If O
you H
want O
to O
add O
complication N
, O
you H
can O
add O
genders N
like O
most O
European O
languages N
like O
French O
and O
German O
. O

For O
example N
, O
if O
you H
want O
the O
word N
' O
horse A
' O
to O
be O
a O
boy H
, O
you H
may O
want O
' O
the O
horse A
' O
to O
be O
' O
Mat O
Fereder O
' O
, O
but O
a O
' O
cat A
' O
to O
be O
a O
girl H
, O
you H
may O
want O
, O
' O
the O
cat A
' O
to O
be O
' O
Fet O
Kamaow O
' O
. O

Consider O
basing O
your H
language N
on O
an O
existing O
language N
. O

For O
example N
, O
in O
my H
made O
up O
language N
, O
' O
Vogelaviatiolap O
' O
means N
Bird A
. O

If O
you H
haven't O
have O
n't O
guessed O
, O
it O
comes O
from O
the O
following O
: O

' O
Vogel O
' O
comes O
from O
German O
, O
which O
means N
bird A

' O
aviatio O
' O
comes O
from O
English O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
uncompleted O
though O
, O
because O
the O
word N
is O
part N
of O
the O
term N
' O
aviation N
' O

' O
lap O
' O
comes O
from O
Onomatopoeia N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
a O
completed O
term N
, O
but O
it O
is O
supposed O
to O
come O
from O
' O
Flap N
! O
' O

Consider O
basing O
some O
of O
your H
words N
from O
other O
words N
you H
have O
invented O
. O

For O
example N
, O
if O
you H
invented O
the O
word N
' O
China O
' O
as O
' O
Khinssa O
' O
, O
' O
Drink O
' O
as O
' O
Bever O
' O
, O
and O
the O
word N
' O
Accident N
' O
as O
' O
Casnondelibreaten O
' O
, O
why O
not O
make O
the O
word N
' O
tea N
' O
as O
' O
Khincasnonbever O
' O
or O
' O
Bevernondelibreatekin O

Why O
not O

You H
can O
even O

even O
take O
some O
words N
of O

, O
altering O
them O
or O
not O
. O

You H

make O
the O
word N

not O
missing O
a O

Tips N

Make O
sure O
that O
it O
is O
a O
language N
that O
while O
speaking O
, O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
get O
a O
literal O
knot N
in O
your H
tongue N
! O

Remember O
you H
should O
know O
how O
to O
write O
it O
. O

For O
example N
we H
write O
it O
from O
left O
to O
right O
, O
in O
Arabic O
it's O
it O
's H
right O
to O
left O
, O
Chinese O
is O
in O
columns N
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

Make O
sure O
that O
you H
and O
your H
friend(s) H
all O
follow O
a O
systematic O
language N
system N
. O

In O
other O
words N
, O
make O
sure O
that O
you H
follow O
the O
same O
guidelines N
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
use H
random O
letters N
. O

It O
should O
make O
some O
sense N
, O
so O
that O
it O
will O
be O
easier O
to O
learn O
and O
speak O
with O
[ O
Example N
: O
Don't O
Do O
n't O
use H
oh O
as O
e O
, O
use H
hello O
as O
llo O
, O
and O
use H
See O
ya H
as O
c O
yah O
) O
. O

Make O
sure O
you H
practice O
saying O
and O
spelling O
out H
many O
basic O
words N
in O
your H
language N
, O
English O
examples N
: O
is O
, O
who O
, O
when O
, O
of O
, O
why O
, O
if O
, O
what O
, O
where O
, O
can O
, O
may O
, O
etc. O

When O
starting O
off O
, O
follow O
closely O
to O
a O
language N
you H
like O
. O

This O
will O
make O
grammar N
much O
easier O
to O
make O
. O

You H
must O
avoid O
simply O
copying O
the O
grammar N
rules N
, O
however O
, O
as O
this O
would O
technically O
turn O
your H
language N
into O
a O
code N
. O

Practice O
your H
language N
frequently O
so O
that O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
forget O
it O
! O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
forget O
punctuation N
! O

As O
a O
shortcut N
, O
and O
for O
a O
bit N
of O
interesting O
background N
, O
add O
connotation N
to O
various O
letters N
, O
preferably O
vowels N
. O

To H
do O
this O
, O
think O
of O
various O
words N
that O
begin O
with O
/ O
have O
a O
lot N
of O
a O
certain O
vowel N
. O

For O
example N
: O
austere O
, O
acrimony N
, O
ebullient O
, O
embolden O
; O
in O
this O
case N
, O
the O
vowel N
A H
might O
carry O
with O
it O
a O
negative O
meaning N
, O
whereas O
E H
would O
be O
positive N
. O

Then O
, O
even O
if O
you H
forget O
your H
own O
words N
without O
the O
help O
of O
your H
dictionary N
, O
you H
could O
still O
make O
a O
good O
guess O
based O
on O
the O
composition N
of O
the O
letters N
. O

Try O
not O
to O
make O
your H
words N
sound N
like O
utter O
and O
complete O
gibberish N
just O
add O
a O
little O
extra O
than O
our H
regular O
English O
language N
. O

We H
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
a O
knot N
in O
your H
tongue N
after O
speaking O
to O
your H
friends H
. O

Just O
put O
marks O
over O
the O
letters N
or O
make O
up O
something O
right O
on O
the O
spot N
, O
you H
might O
have O
to O
take O
some O
time N
on O
this O
! O

Basing O
letters N
on O
objects N
( O
pictographs N
) O
is O
an O
easy O
way N
to O
start O
a O
writing N
system N
. O

Try O
this O
with O
a O
group N
of O
friends H
. O

It's O
It O
's H
much O
more O
fun O
when O
there O
are O
other O
people N
that O
can O
understand O
your H
language N
. O

Email O
or O
text N
your H
friends H
the O
language N
so O
that O
they O
won't O
wo O
n't O
be O
so O
confused O
. O

When O
making O
a O
writing N
system N
, O
take O
a O
break O
about O
every O
five O
minutes N
and O
come O
back O
to O
it O
or O
all O
your H
letters N
will O
begin O
to O
look O
identical O
. O

If O
you H
want O
to O
make O
other O
languages N
, O
you H
can O
use H
this O
language N
as O
a O
model N
and O
change O
some O
letters N
or O
sounds N
to O
create O
a O
different O
language N
. O

This O
makes O
your H
first O
language N
a O
proto-language O
— O
a O
language N
that O
branches N
off O
into O
a O
family H
of O
languages N

How O
to O
Cope O
With O
a O
Double O
Parachute N
Failure N

While O
skydiving N
, O
it O
is O
possible O
( O
yet O
extremely O
unlikely O
) O
that O
both O
your H
primary O
and O
reserve O
parachutes N
will O
malfunction O
, O
leaving O
you H
with O
no O
method N
of O
reducing O
your H
velocity N
. O

In O
the O
vast O
majority N
of O
cases N
, O
this O
will O
not O
occur O
; O
nevertheless O
, O
in O
this O
event N
these O
coping N
strategies N
may O
assist O
. O

Steps N

Remain O
calm O
. O

This O
may O
seem O
obvious O
, O
but O
deep O
, O
even O
breathing N
( O
despite O
the O
rushing O
slipstream N
) O
and O
controlling O
your H
heart N
- O
rate N
are O
essential O
to O
your H
continued O
survival N
. O

Entreat O
assistance N
. O

If O
both O
your H
primary O
and O
reserve O
chutes N
have O
malfunctioned O
, O
signal N
immediately O
to O
a O
fellow H
jumper H
who O
has O
not O
yet O
deployed O
their O
chute N
, O
waving O
your H
arms N
and O
signalling O
that O
your H
own O
is O
not O
functional O
. O

If O
this O
is O
a O
solo O
jump N
, O
then O
skip O
to O
step O
6 O
. O

Prepare O
for O
deployment N
. O

After O
linking O
arms N
with O
your H
fellow H
jumper H
, O
you H
will O
need O
to O
hook O
your H
arms N
through O
their O
chest N
strap N
, O
or O
through O
both O
sides N
of O
the O
front N
of O
their O
harness N
, O
as O
far O
as O
you H
can O
, O
then O
grab O
onto O
your H
own O
strap N
. O

Deploy O
. O

The O
shock N
of O
the O
chute N
deployment N
will O
be O
intense O
. O

The O
G H
- O
forces N
will O
multiply O
your H
body N
weight N
, O
making O
it O
impossible O
to O
hold O
on O
; O
this O
is O
why O
hooking O
your H
arms N
through O
the O
harness N
is O
essential O
. O

It O
is O
likely O
that O
the O
shock N
will O
dislocate O
or O
break O
both O
your H
arms N
; O
nevertheless O
this O
is O
a O
small O
price N
to O
pay O
for O
your H
life N
. O

Prepare O
for O
impact N
. O

If O
your H
companion's O
companion H
's H
canopy N
has O
successfully O
opened O
, O
then O
both O
your H
chances N
of O
survival N
have O
dramatically O
increased O
. O

With O
a O
large O
and O
slow O
canopy N
, O
your H
chances N
are O
even O
better O
. O

The O
canopy N
must O
be O
steered O
away O
from O
power N
lines N
and O
similar O
obstructions N
; O
try O
for O
a O
large O
body N
of O
water N
if O
you H
are O
confident O
your H
companion H
can O
save O
you H
from O
drowning O
. O

Alternative N
: O
Lack N
of O
companions H

If O
this O
is O
a O
solo O
jump N
, O
which O
constitutes O
the O
minority N
of O
skydivers H
, O
your H
only O
recourse N
is O
to O
ensure O
that O
at O
least O
one N
of O
your H
own O
chutes N
opens O
. O

In O
this O
case N
, O
the O
excellent O
advice N
offered O
by O
your H
instructors H
on O
assisting O
chute N
opening N
may O
be O
of O
assistance N
to O
you H
. O

If O
it O
becomes O
apparent O
that O
you H
cannot O
can O
not O
open O
either O
of O
your H
two O
parachutes N
, O
or O
that O
for O
some O
other O
reason N
they O
are O
fatally O
non-functional O
, O
then O
the O
following O
steps N
may O
be O
of O
some O
minor O
assistance N
. O

Appeal O
. O

If O
you H
are O
of O
a O
religious O
turn O
of O
mind N
, O
you H
may O
wish O
at O
this O
point N
to O
offer O
a O
prayer N
to O
a O
god A
, O
goddess A
, O
protective O
spirit N
or O
guardian H
angel A
. O

St H
Jude H
, O
the O
patron H
saint H
of O
Lost O
Causes N
, O
comes O
to O
mind N
. O

Objectively O
, O
this O
is O
not O
likely O
to O
help O
very O
much O
; O
but O
it O
may O
improve O
your H
emotional O
state N
. O

If O
you H
do O
not O
have O
any O
religious O
beliefs N
, O
or O
are O
for O
another O
reason N
unwilling O
to O
appeal O
to O
your H
patron H
deity A
, O
skip O
this O
step O
. O

Contemplate O
. O

As O
you H
approach N
the O
Earth O
at O
, O
or O
close O
to O
, O
terminal O
velocity N
, O
you H
may O
wish O
to O
contemplate O
your H
past N
existence N
, O
and O
the O
possibility N
of O
a O
future N
afterlife N
. O

A H
strategy N
that O
might O
prove O
helpful O
is O
to O
consider O
how O
fortunate O
you H
are O
that O
life N
has O
been O
good O
to O
you H
so O
far O
. O

Alternatively O
, O
if O
life N
has O
not O
been O
good O
to O
you H
so O
far O
, O
( O
and O
considering O
your H
current O
situation N
this O
seems O
more O
likely O
) O
consider O
how O
lucky O
you H
are O
that O
it O
will O
not O
be O
troubling O
you H
much O
longer O
. O

Expect O
impact N
. O

You H
are O
unlikely O
to O
have O
the O
time N
or O
ability N
to O
aim N
for O
a O
soft O
landing N
- O
spot N
, O
body N
of O
water N
, O
or O
other O
impact N
site N
that O
might O
improve O
your H
chances N
of O
survival N
. O

There O
is O
a O
minuscule O
chance N
that O
your H
impact N
will O
result N
in O
non-life-threatening O
injuries N
; O
if O
this O
seems O
incredibly O
far O
- O
fetched O
, O
comfort O
yourself H
that O
double O
chute N
failure N
in O
modern O
times N
is O
also O
extremely O
unlikely O
, O
and O
that O
you H
have O
already O
beaten O
worse O
odds O
. O

Tips N

Your H
reserve O
chute N
should O
have O
been O
packed O
by O
a O
certified O
rigger H
and O
is O
moderately O
less O
likely O
to O
fail O
; O
therefore O
, O
it O
may O
be O
helpful O
to O
focus O
your H
efforts N
on O
opening N
your H
reserve O
parachute N
. O

Some O
humans A
who O
have O
, O
for O
various O
reasons N
, O
become O
aware O
of O
their O
impending O
death N
, O
develop O
psychological O
coping N
strategies N
to O
deal O
with O
this O
; O
for O
instance N
, O
the O
Kubler O
- O
Ross H
phases N
of O
grief N
. O

Since O
your H
own O
death N
approaches O
far O
more O
quickly O
, O
this O
is O
unlikely O
to O
be O
of O
any O
use H
to O
you H
. O

Warnings N

Water N
landings N
: O
if O
you H
have O
successfully O
attached O
to O
a O
companion H
whose O
chute N
opens O
, O
keep O
in O
mind N
that O
both O
your H
arms N
may O
be O
broken O
or O
dislocated O
, O
and O
you H
may O
be O
unable O
to O
swim O
or O
tread O
water N
before O
your H
chute N
fills O
and O
drags O
you H
under O
. O

If O
, O
after O
total N
chute N
failure N
, O
you H
land O
on O
something O
soft O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
instead O
of O
being O
killed O
outright O
, O
you H
may O
be O
permanently O
paralyzed O
due O
to O
spinal O
injury N
. O

If O
you H
have O
a O
strong O
aversion N
to O
this O
outcome N
, O
aiming O
head N
- O
downward O
before O
impact N
in O
the O
manner N
of O
an O
Olympic O
diver H
may O
ensure O
the O
destruction N
of O
your H
cranium N

your H
immediate O
demise N

How O
to O
Stop O
Procrastinating O

If O
you're H
you H
're O
a O
chronic O
procrastinator H
, O
you H
know O
the O
pain N
and O
stress N
that O
comes O
with O
putting O
things N
off O
. O

Although O
you H
may O
have O
the O
desire N
to O
accomplish O
something O
, O
getting O
the O
motivation N
to O
do O
it O
is O
a O
different O
matter N
. O

Fortunately O
, O
overcoming O
your H
procrastination N
is O
easy O
to O
do O
when O
you H
put O
your H
mind N
to O
it O
. O

If O
you H

, O
and O

Steps N

Create O
a O
to O
- O
do O
list N
. O

Yes O
, O
make O
yourself H
an O
old O
fashioned O
to O
- O
do O
list N
with O
check O
boxes N
and O
everything O
. O

List O
everything O
, O
big O
and O
small O
, O
that O
you H
have O
to O
do O
for O
your H
entire O
day N
; O
break O
big O
activities N
into O
smaller O
bits N
if O
necessary O
. O

Then O
, O
as O
you H
work N
through O
your H
day N
, O
check O
off O
each O
of O
the O
items N
on O
your H
list N
. O

You H
will O
feel O
a O
growing O
sense N
of O
pride N
as O
you H
visually O
monitor O
your H
ever O
- O
diminishing O
list N
of O
projects N
. O

Focus O
your H
list N
on O
including O
the O
things N
you H
typically O
put O
off O
, O
not O
the O
things N
you H
are O
sure O
to O
do O
on O
a O
regular O
basis N
. O

If O
necessary O
, O
set O
time N
- O
frames N
for O
your H
items N
to O
be O
done O
by O
. O

For O
example N
, O
list N
“ O
take O
the O
dog A
for O
a O
walk O
by O
12:30 O
” O
rather O
than O
simply O
“ O
walk O
the O
dog A
. O
” O

Re-evaluate O
your H
list N
halfway O
through O
your H
day N
to O
rank N
your H
items N
based O
on O
highest O
priority N
. O

Then O
, O
tackle O
the O
most O
important O
ones N
before O
looking O
back O
at O
the O
smaller O
things N
to O
do O
. O

Keep O
a O
notebook N
by O
hand N
before O
you H
start O
your H
workday N
. O

Write O
every O
thought O
down O
that O
comes O
up O
during O
work N
. O

Every O
single O
to O
do O
or O
things N
you H
want O
to O
do O
at O
that O
specific O
moment N
. O

Don't O
Do O
n't O
do O
it O
, O
put O
it O
on O
a O
list N
and O
do O
it O
later O
. O

This O
prevents O
you H
from O
getting O
into O
the O
" O
procrastination N
zone N
. O
" O

Finish O
the O
hard O
stuff N
. O

When O
you H
have O
a O
looming O
project N
that's O
that O
's H
bogging O
you H
down O
and O
making O
you H
unproductive O
in O
other O
areas N
, O
tackle O
it O
first O
. O

Finishing O
the O
largest O
item N
on O
your H
list N
of O
things N
to O
do O
will O
make O
you H
feel O
extra O
productive O
and O
give O
you H
the O
boost N
to O
do O
other O
things N
you’ve O
you H
’ve O
been O
pushing O
to O
the O
side N
. O

If O
your H
“ O
big O
project N
” O
is O
something O
that O
can’t O
ca O
n’t O
be O
done O
in O
one N
sitting O
, O
make O
a O
list N
of O
small O
parts N
of O
it O
that O
you H
can O
accomplish O
today N
. O

Don’t O
Do O
n’t O
worry O
about O
completing O
the O
entire O
thing N
, O
but O
take O
steps N
now O
so O
that O
doing O
so O
in O
the O
future N
is O
a O
breeze N
. O

Make O
an O
ultimate O
to O
- O
do O
list N
for O
this O
single O
project N
, O
and O
have O
it O
placed O
somewhere O
you H
will O
see O
it O
on O
a O
regular O
basis N
. O

As O
you H
mark N
things N
off O
, O
you H
will O
be O
motivated O
to O
continue O
doing O
so O
, O
and O
seeing O
it O
on O
a O
regular O
basis N
will O
remind O
you H
that O
your H
project N
needs N
to O
be O
done O
. O

Do O
two O
- O
minute O
tasks N
. O

Whenever O
you H
are O
presented O
with O
something O
that O
you H
don’t O
do O
n’t O
want O
to O
do O
or O
would O
consider O
putting O
off O
, O
ask O
yourself H
, O
“ O
will O
this O
take O
me H
less O
than O
two O
minutes N
to O
finish O
? O
” O

For O
many O
of O
us H
, O
this O
includes O
small O
chores N
, O
like O
taking O
out H
the O
trash N
or O
pulling O
a O
few O
weeds A
, O
but O
can O
include O
simple O
tasks N
in O
all O
areas N
of O
life N
. O

Anything O
that O
you H
want O
to O
put O
off O
but O
takes O
two O
minutes N
to O
do O
- O
do O
it O
. O

Simply O
force N
yourself H
to O
use H
the O
next O
120 O
seconds N
to O
be O
productive O
and O
do O
the O
duty N
you H
normally O
would O
push O
off O
for O
hours N
or O
days N
. O
[ O

Create O
a O
timed O
work N
frenzy N
. O

If O
you H
find O
yourself H
being O
pulled O
off O
into O
the O
depths N
of O
daydreams N
, O
set O
a O
period N
of O
time N
to O
do O
nothing N
but O
work N
. O

Take O
ten O
minutes N
and O
remove O
all O
distractions N
- O
your H
phone N
, O
magazines N
, O
or O
thoughts N
of O
your H
attractive O
love O
- O
and O
go O
into O
a O
working O
frenzy N
. O

Force O
yourself H
to O
work N
productively O
for O
ten O
minutes N
, O
and O
then O
go O
back O
to O
whatever O
it O
was O
you H
were O
doing O
. O

Chances N
are O
, O
you’ll O
you H
’ll O
get O
into O
a O
groove N
and O
keep O
working O
at O
a O
high O
pace N
even O
when O
your H
frenzy N
time N
is O
out H
. O

Working O
with O
a O
timer N
is O
generally O
regarded O
by O
most O
experts H
as O
being O
one N
of O
the O
best O
ways N
to O
develop O
self O
- O
discipline O
and O
stop N
procrastination N

The O
most O
famous O
method N
of O
working O
to O
strict O
time N
controls N
( O
known O
as O
time N
- O
boxing N
) O
involves O
creating O
a O
list N
of O
tasks N
. O

Each O
task N
is O
then O
assigned O
an O
exact O
amount N
of O
time N
to O
complete O

If O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
finish O
the O
task N
in O
the O
allotted O
time N
, O
then O
you H
move O
on O
to O
the O
next O
one N
. O

Using O
this O
work N
arrangement N

it O
forces N
you H
to O
take O
action N

as O
you H
can't O
ca O
n't O
afford O
to O
waste O
any O
time N

[ O

. O

Give O
yourself H
a O
break O

If O
you H

seem O
to O
focus O
and O
are O
working O
half O
- O
heartedly O
at O
your H
tasks N

give O
yourself H
a O
brief N
break O

Set O
a O
timer N
for O
ten O
minutes N
, O
and O
take O
a O
nap N
, O
read O
a O
book O

or O
call O
your H

Do O
whatever O
it O

been O
daydreaming O
about O
so O
that O
the O
temptation N

How O
to O
Play O
Muggle O
Quidditch O

In O
the O
Harry H
Potter H
series N
written O
by O
JK O
Rowling O
the O
main O
wizarding O
sport N
is O
Quidditch O
. O

However O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
have O
magical O
powers N
to O
play O
. O

There O
are O
many O
different O
ways N
of O
playing O
Quidditch O
, O
but O
the O
most O
commonly O
used O
set O
of O
rules N

those O
given O
by O
the O

can O
be O

In O
the O
past N
Muggle O
Quidditch O
has O
mainly O
been O
played O
at O
colleges N

there O
has O
been O
a O
dramatic O
rise N
in O
the O
number N
of O
community N

Quidditch O
has O
also O
spread O
outside O

quaffle O
and O
three O
bludgers O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
field N
. O

Ideally O
the O
quaffle O
and O
bludgers O
should O
be O
slightly O
deflated O
so O
that O
they O
are O
easier O
to O
throw O
and O
catch O
. O

Start O
the O
game N
. O

Both O
teams N
start O
from O
the O
edges N
and O
attempt N
to O
obtain O
the O
quaffle O
and O
bludgers O
. O

Follow O
your H
duty N
depending O
what O
type N
of O
player H
you H
are O
: O

Chasers H
try O
to O
score N
by O
throwing O
the O
quaffle O
into O
one N
of O
the O
three O
goal N
hoops N
. O

Each O
score N
is O
worth N
10 O
points O
. O

Beaters H
try O
to O
peg O
players H
with O
their O
bludger O
. O

If O
a O
player H
is O
pegged O
they O
have O
to O
stop N
what O
they're O
they O
're O
doing O
and O
pay O
a O
penalty N
; O
i.e. O
( O
drop O
the O
quaffle O
in O
the O
case N
of O
a O
chaser H
) O
and O
run O
back O
to O
and O
touch O
their O
goal N
post N
or O
alternatively O
sit O
down O
for O
10 O
seconds N
. O

Keepers H
guard O
the O
goal N
posts N
at O
each O
end N
and O
attempt N
to O
block O
chasers' O
chasers H
' O
attempts N
at O
scoring O
. O

If O
Keeper H
is O
close O
to O
their O
hoops N
they O
are O
safe O
from O
being O
hit O
by O
bludgers O
. O

Seekers H
try O
to O
tackle O
the O
snitch H
( O
a O
person H
) O
or O
obtain O
an O
object N
attached O
to O
the O
snitch H
such O
as O
a O
sock N
or O
flag N
. O

You H
can O
establish O
you H
own O
rules N
as O
to O
how O
a O
player H
catches O
the O
snitch H
. O

A H
common O
way N
to O
play O
is O
to O
make O
the O
snitch H
a O
person H
, O
and O
give O
the O
snitch H
a O
head N
start O
to O
run O
and O
hide N
in O
defined O
boundaries N
. O

Then O
the O
seekers H
search N
for O
the O
snitch H
, O
and O
attempt N
to O
tag O
the O
player H
. O

Other O
methods N
, O
such O
as O
the O
method N
adopted O
in O
2005 O
, O
makes O
the O
snitch H
a O
tennis N
ball N
in O
a O
sock N
, O
hanging O
out H
of O
the O
running O
shorts N
of O
the O
snitch H
runner H
. O

Regardless O
of O
method N
, O
the O
winning O
seeker H
wins O
30 O
points O
for O
his O
or O
her O
team N
, O
unlike O
the O
books N
, O
in O
which O
the O
snitch H
is O
worth N
150 O
points O
. O

The O
creators H
of O
Muggle O
Quidditch O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
worth N
too O
many O
points O
so O
changed O
the O
value N
of O
the O
snitch H
for O
muggle O
Quidditch O
. O

The O
snitch H
, O
generally O
a O
track N
runner H
, O
runs O
around O
( O
usually O
the O
boundaries N
) O
trying O
to O
evade O
the O
seekers H
. O

The O
referee H
should O
ensure O
that O
rules N
are O
being O
followed O
. O

They O
also O
keep O
track N
of O
the O
score N
. O

Play O
the O
game N
! O

The O
object N
of O
the O
game N
is O
to O
score N
the O
most O
points O
and O
the O
game N
ends O
when O

You H
don't O
do O
n't O
need O
flying O
broomsticks N
or O
magic N
balls N
to O
play O
this O
version N
of O
the O
game N
- O
it's O
it O
's H
tailor H
- O
made O
for O
muggles O
like O
us H
. O

This O
video N
shows N
a O
more O
realistic O
approach N
to O
playing O
Quidditch O
. O

Tips N

Alternatively O
the O
snitch H
can O
be O
a O
small O
yellow O
ball N
( O
tennis N
balls N
work N
great O
) O
that O
is O
hidden O
before O
the O
game N
starts O
by O
a O
bystander H
or O
referee H
. O

Establish O
boundaries N
and O
have O
the O
seekers H
look O
for O
the O
snitch H
. O

Beaters H
can O
try O
hitting O
the O
bludgers O
around O
in O
the O
air N
with O
a O
shortened O
hockey N
sticks N
or O
a O
short O
bat A
. O

They O
could O
also O
use H
regular O
- O
length N
hockey N
sticks N
to O
hit O
bludgers O
( O
perhaps O
wiffle N
balls N
) O
on O
the O
ground N
. O

The O
simplest O
way N
is O
to O
just O
peg O
players H
by O
throwing O
dodge O
balls N
. O

It O
may O
be O
easier O
to O
play O
without O
brooms N
( O
but O
also O
less O
fun O
! O
) O
. O

Remember O
that O
the O
snitch H
runner H
, O
if O
you H
choose O
to O
use H
one N
, O
is O
not O
an O
actual O
player H
in O
the O
game N
, O
therefore O
, O
not O
bound O
by O
any O
of O
the O
rules N
. O

If O
desired O
, O
the O
snitch H
is O
able O
to O
do O
whatever O
he O
or O
she O
wants O
to O
avoid O
capture O
. O

See O
How O
to O
Be O
a O
Snitch H
in O
Quidditch O
for O
more O
information N
. O

You H
can O
play O
water N
quidditch O
in O
a O
pool N
. O

Almost O
all O
the O
same O
rules N
apply O
. O

Have O
someone H
throw O
something O
( O
the O
snitch H
) O
on O
a O
line N
into O
the O
pool N
at O
regular O
intervals N
. O

They O
can O
even O
use H
fake O
snitches H
. O

You H
can O
buy O
authentic O
looking O
brooms N
to O
make O
the O
game N
more O
realistic O
. O

There O
is O
a O
very O
large O
Quidditch O
community N
, O
have O
a O
look O
at O
the O
IQA O
website N
to O
find O
teams N
near O
you H
. O

One O
variation N
is O
Quarter N
Snitch H
Quidditch O
. O

Find O
a O
quarter N
or O
another O
small O
coin N
. O

Have O
both O
of O
the O
teams N
turn O
around O
and O
have O
the O
referee H
throw O
it O
into O
the O
grass A
or O
pitch N
while O
the O
teams N
aren't O
are O
n't O
looking O
. O

Play O
while O
the O
seekers H
look O
for O
the O
snitch H
. O

Another O
variation N
is O
where O
the O
referee H
places N
the O
snitch H
somewhere O
in O
the O
field N
( O
in O
this O
case N
it's O
it O
's H
a O
small O
ball N
) O
. O

The O
seeker H
has O
to O
find O
the O
snitch H
blindfolded O
, O
relying O
only O
on O
the O
coach's O
coach H
's H
instructions N
, O
while O
the O
game N
is O
still O
on O
. O

Warnings N

Stay O
hydrated O
and O
exercise N
wisely O
. O

A H
ball N
flying O
in O
the O

can O
hurt O

If O
you're H
you H

How O
to O
Prepare O
Quinoa O

Quinoa O
is O
known O
as O
the O
little O
rice N
of O
Peru O
. O

The O
Incas O
treated O
the O
crop N
as O
sacred O
and O
referred O
to O
quinoa O
as O
" O
chisaya O
mama O
" O
or O
" O
mother H
of O
all O
grains N

" O
golden O
implements N
. O
" O

Quinoa O
is O
rich O

Tips N
. O

If O
you H
want O
to O
make O
it O
more O
quickly O
, O
cut O
the O
skittles O
in O
half O
before O
putting O
them O
into O
vodka N
. O

Shake O
every O
15 O
minutes N
. O

They'll O
They O
'll O
dissolve O
in O
an O
hour N
instead O
of O
a O
day N
. O

Or H
you H
could O
just O
scoop O
them O
out H
when O
the O
color N
dissolves O
. O

Start O
with O
small O
amount N
of O
vodka N
and O
Skittles O
at O
first O
to O
experiment O
which O
combination N
of O
taste N
suits N
you H
best O
. O

You H
can O
carry O
this O
out H
with O
larger O
amount N
of O
vodka N
and O
Skittles O
once O
you H
have O
decided O
that O
you H
enjoy O
the O
taste N
. O

The O
lime O
green O
Skittles O
add O
a O
sourness N
to O
the O
drink N
, O
so O
if O
you H
want O
one N
that's O
that O
's H
sweet O
, O
leave O
the O
green O
ones N
out H
and O
add O
them O
to O
their O
own O
bottle N
for O
a O
sour O
lime O
vodka N
. O

Another O
approach N
is O
to O
buy O
five O
bottles N
of O
vodka N
and O
five O
bags N
of O
Skittles O
. O

Then O
separate O
the O
candy N
and O
use H
one N
flavor N
for O
each O
bottle N
. O

( O
Or H
get O
four O
bottles N
and O
an O
empty O
, O
to O
allow O
room N
for O
the O
skittles O
. O
) O

If O
using O
a O
t N
- O
shirt N
to O
strain O
, O
be O
sure O
fabric N
softener N
or O
a O
dryer N
sheet N
had O
not O
been O
used O
with O
it O
, O
lets O
you H
get O
some O
extra O
( O
unwanted O
) O
flavoring N
( O
and O
potentially O
toxic O
chemicals N
) O
. O

Warnings N

Drink O

Resumption N
of O
the O
session N
. O

I H
declare O
resumed O
the O
session N
of O
the O
European O
Parliament N
adjourned O
on O
Friday O
17 O
December O
1999 O
, O
and O
I H
would O
like O
once O
again O
to O
wish O
you H
a O
happy O
new O
year N
in O
the O
hope O
that O
you H
enjoyed O
a O
pleasant O
festive O
period N
. O

In O
the O
meantime N
, O
I H
should O
like O
to O
observe O
a O
minute O
's H
silence N
, O
as O
a O
number N
of O
Members H
have O
requested O
, O
on O
behalf N
of O
all O
the O
victims H
concerned O
, O
particularly O
those O
of O
the O
terrible O
storms N
, O
in O
the O
various O
countries N
of O
the O
European O
Union O
. O

Please O
rise N
, O
then O
, O
for O
this O
minute O
's H
silence N
. O

( O
The O
House O
rose O
and O
observed O
a O
minute O
's H
silence N
) O
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
on O
a O
point N
of O
order O
. O

You H
will O
be O
aware O
from O
the O
press N
and O
television N
that O
there O
have O
been O
a O
number N
of O
bomb N
explosions N
and O
killings N
in O
Sri O
Lanka O
. O

One O
of O
the O
people N
assassinated O
very O
recently O
in O
Sri O
Lanka O
was O
Mr N
Kumar H
Ponnambalam O
, O
who O
had O
visited O
the O
European O
Parliament N
just O
a O
few O
months N
ago O
. O

Would O
it O
be O
appropriate O
for O
you H
, O
Madam H
President H
, O
to O
write O
a O
letter N
to O
the O
Sri O
Lankan O
President H
expressing O
Parliament N
's H
regret O
at O
his O
and O
the O
other O
violent O
deaths N
in O
Sri O
Lanka O
and O
urging O
her O
to O
do O
everything O
she O
possibly O
can O
to O
seek O
a O
peaceful O
reconciliation N
to O
a O
very O
difficult O
situation N
? O

If O
the O
House O
agrees O
, O
I H
shall O
do O
as O
Mr N
Evans H
has O
suggested O
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
on O
a O
point N
of O
order O
. O

I H
would O
like O
your H
advice N
about O
Rule N
143 O
concerning O
inadmissibility N
. O

My H
question N
relates O
to O
something O
that O
will O
come O
up O
on O
Thursday O
and O
which O
I H
will O
then O
raise O
again O
. O

I H
believe O
that O
the O
principle N
of O
relative O
stability N
is O
a O
fundamental O
legal O
principle N
of O
the O
common O
fisheries N
policy N
and O
a O
proposal N
to O
subvert O
it O
would O
be O
legally O
inadmissible O
. O

I H
want O
to O
know O
whether O
one N
can O
raise O
an O
objection N
of O
that O
kind N
to O
what O
is O
merely O
a O
report N
, O
not O
a O
legislative O
proposal N
, O
and O
whether O
that O
is O
something O
I H
can O
competently O
do O
on O
Thursday O
. O

that O
is O
precisely O
the O
time N
when O
you H
may O
, O
if O
you H
wish O
, O
raise O
this O
question N
, O
i.e. O
on O
Thursday O
prior O
to O
the O
start O
of O
the O
presentation N
of O
the O
report N
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
coinciding O
with O
this O
year N
's H
first O
part N
- O
session N
of O
the O
European O
Parliament N
, O
a O
date N
has O
been O
set O
, O
unfortunately O
for O
next O
Thursday O
, O
in O
Texas H
in O
America O
, O
for O
the O
execution N
of O
a O
young O
34 O
year N
- O
old O
man H
who O
has O
been O
sentenced O
to O
death N
. O

However O
, O
I H
would O
ask O
you H
, O
in O
accordance N
with O
the O
line N
which O
is O
now O
constantly O
followed O
by O
the O
European O
Parliament N
and O
by O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
European O
Community N
, O
to O
make O
representations N
, O
using O
the O
weight N
of O
your H
prestigious O
office N
and O
the O
institution N
you H
represent O
, O
to O
the O
President H
and O
to O
the O
Governor H
of O
Texas H
, O
Mr N
Bush H
, O
who O
has O
the O
power N
to O
order O
a O
stay O
of O
execution N
and O
to O
reprieve N
the O
condemned O
person H
. O

This O
is O
all O
in O
accordance N
with O
the O
principles N
that O
we H
have O
always O
upheld O
. O

Thank O
you H
, O
Mr N
Segni O
, O
I H
shall O
do O
so O
gladly O
. O

Indeed O
, O
it O
is O
quite O
in O
keeping N
with O
the O
positions N
this O
House O
has O
always O
adopted O
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
I H
should O
like O
to O
draw O
your H
attention N
to O
a O
case N
in O
which O
this O
Parliament N
has O
consistently O
shown O
an O
interest N
. O

All O
of O
us H
here O
are O
pleased O
that O
the O
courts N
have O
acquitted O
him O
and O
made O
it O
clear N
that O
in O
Russia O
, O
too O
, O
access O
to O
environmental O
information N
is O
a O
constitutional O
right O
. O

Now O
, O
however O
, O
he O
is O
to O
go O
before O
the O
courts N
once O
more O
because O
the O
public O
prosecutor H
is O
appealing O
. O

We H
know O
, O
and O
we H
have O
stated O
as O
much O
in O
very O
many O
resolutions N
indeed O
, O
including O
specifically O
during O
the O
last O
plenary O
part N
- O
session N
of O
last O
year N
, O
that O
this O
is O
not O
solely O
a O
legal O
case N
and O
that O
it O
is O
wrong O
for O
Alexander H
Nikitin O
to O
be O
accused O
of O
criminal O
activity N
and O
treason N
because O
of O
our H
involvement N
as O
the O
beneficiaries H
of O
his O
findings N
. O

These O
findings N
form N
the O
basis N
of O
the O
European O
programmes N
to O
protect O
the O
Barents O
Sea N
, O
and O
that O
is O
why O
I H
would O
ask O
you H
to O
examine O
a O
draft N
letter N
setting N
out H
the O
most O
important O
facts N
and O
to O
make O
Parliament N
's H
position N
, O
as O
expressed O
in O
the O
resolutions N
which O
it O
has O
adopted O
, O
clear N
as O
far O
as O
Russia O
is O
concerned O
. O

Yes O
, O
Mrs N
Schroedter O
, O
I H
shall O
be O
pleased O
to O
look O
into O
the O
facts N
of O
this O
case N
when O
I H
have O
received O
your H
letter N
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
I H
would O
firstly O
like O
to O
compliment O
you H
on O
the O
fact N
that O
you H
have O
kept O
your H
word N
and O
that O
, O
during O
this O
first O
part N
- O
session N
of O
the O
new O
year N
, O
the O
number N
of O
television N
channels N
in O
our H
offices N
has O
indeed O
increased O
considerably O
. O

But O
, O
Madam H
President H
, O
my H
personal O
request N
has O
not O
been O
met O
. O

I H
would O
therefore O
once O
more O
ask O
you H
to O
ensure O
that O
we H
get O
a O
Dutch O
channel N
as O
well O
. O

Mrs N
Plooij O
- O
Van H
Gorsel O
, O
I H
can O
tell O
you H
that O
this O
matter N
is O
on O
the O
agenda N
for O
the O
Quaestors H
' O
meeting N
on O
Wednesday O
. O

It O
will O
, O
I H
hope O
, O
be O
examined O
in O
a O
positive N
light N
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
can O
you H
tell O
me H
why O
this O
Parliament N
does O
not O
adhere O
to O
the O
health N
and O
safety N
legislation N
that O
it O
actually O
passes O
? O

Why O
has O
no O
air N
quality N
test N
been O
done O
on O
this O
particular O
building N
since O
we H
were O
elected O
? O

Why O
has O
there O
been O
no O
Health N
and O
Safety N
Committee N
meeting N
since O
1998 O
? O

Why O
has O
there O
been O
no O
fire N
drill N
, O
either O
in O
the O
Brussels O
Parliament N
buildings N
or O
the O
Strasbourg O
Parliament N
buildings N
? O

Why O
are O
there O
no O
fire N
instructions N
? O

Why O
have O
the O
staircases N
not O
been O
improved O
since O
my H
accident N
? O

Why O
are O
no O
- O
smoking O
areas N
not O
enforced O
? O

Mrs N
Lynne O
, O
you H
are O
quite O
right O
and O
I H
shall O
check O
whether O
this O
has O
actually O
not O
been O
done O
. O

I H
shall O
also O
refer O
the O
matter N
to O
the O
College N
of O
Quaestors H
, O
and O
I H
am O
certain O
that O
they O
will O
be O
keen O
to O
ensure O
that O
we H
comply O
with O
the O
regulations N
we H
ourselves H
vote N
on O
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
Mrs N
Díez O
González H
and O
I H
had O
tabled O
questions N
on O
certain O
opinions N
of O
the O
Vice N
- O
President H
, O
Mrs N
De H
Palacio O
, O
which O
appeared O
in O
a O
Spanish O
newspaper N
. O

The O
competent O
services N
have O
not O
included O
them O
in O
the O
agenda N
on O
the O
grounds N
that O
they O
had O
been O
answered O
in O
a O
previous O
part N
- O
session N
. O

The O
questions N
answered O
previously O
referred O
to O
Mrs N
De H
Palacio O
's H
intervention N
, O
on O
another O
occasion N
, O
and O
not O
to O
these O
comments N
which O
appeared O
in O
the O
Abc O
newspaper N
on O
18 O
November O
. O

I H
admit O
that O
, O
at O
present N
, O
the O
matter N
seems O
to O
be O
somewhat O
confused O
. O

We H
shall O
therefore O
look O
into O
it O
properly O
to O
ensure O
that O
everything O
is O
as O
it O
should O
be O
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
I H
should O
like O
to O
know O
if O
there O
will O
be O
a O
clear N
message N
going O
out H
from O
Parliament N
this O
week N
about O
our H
discontent N
over O
today N
's H
decision N
refusing O
to O
renew O
the O
arms N
embargo N
on O
Indonesia O
, O
considering O
that O
the O
vast O
majority N
in O
this O
Parliament N
have O
endorsed O
the O
arms N
embargo N
in O
Indonesia O
in O
the O
past N
? O

Today N
's H
decision N
not O
to O
renew O
the O
embargo N
is O
extremely O
dangerous O
considering O
the O
situation N
there O
. O

So O
Parliament N
should O
send O
a O
message N
, O
since O
that O
is O
the O
wish O
of O
the O
vast O
majority N
. O

It O
is O
irresponsible O
of O
EU O
Member N
States O
to O
refuse O
to O
renew O
the O
embargo N
. O

As O
people N
have O
said O
, O
the O
situation N
there O
is O
extremely O
volatile O
. O

We H
do O
not O
know O
what O
is O
happening O
. O

In O
any O
event N
, O
this O
question N
is O
not O
presently O
included O
among O
the O
requests N
for O
topical O
and O
urgent O
debate N
on O
Thursday O
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
the O
presentation N
of O
the O
Prodi O
Commission N
's H
political O
programme N
for O
the O
whole O
legislature N
was O
initially O
a O
proposal N
by O
the O
Group N
of O
the O
Party O
of O
European O
Socialists H
which O
was O
unanimously O
approved O
by O
the O
Conference N
of O
Presidents H
in O
September O
and O
which O
was O
also O
explicitly O
accepted O
by O
President H
Prodi O
, O
who O
reiterated O
his O
commitment N
in O
his O
inaugural O
speech N
. O

This O
commitment N
is O
important O
because O
the O
Commission N
is O
a O
body N
with O
a O
monopoly N
of O
initiative N
in O
accordance N
with O
the O
Treaties N
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
basically O
dictates O
this O
Parliament N
's H
political O
and O
legislative O
activity N
for O
the O
next O
five O
years N
. O

I H
would O
also O
like O
to O
point N
out H
, O
Madam H
President H
, O
that O
this O
Parliament N
voted O
to O
express O
its O
confidence N
in O
President H
Prodi O
during O
the O
previous O
legislature N
. O

It O
did O
so O
again O
during O
this O
legislature N
, O
in O
July O
, O
and O
then O
, O
in O
September O
, O
it O
voted O
once O
more O
to O
approve O
the O
whole O
Commission N
. O

There O
has O
therefore O
been O
enough O
time N
for O
the O
Commission N
to O
prepare O
its O
programme N
and O
for O
us H
to O
become O
familiar O
with O
it O
and O
explain O
it O
to O
our H
citizens H
. O

To H
this O
end N
, O
I H
would O
like O
to O
remind O
you H
of O
the O
resolution N
of O
15 O
September O
, O
which O
recommended O
that O
the O
proposal N
be O
presented O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O

The O
events N
of O
last O
week N
- O
which O
originated O
outside O
the O
Conference N
of O
Presidents H
, O
that O
Conference N
being O
used O
simply O
to O
corroborate O
and O
ratify O
decisions N
taken O
elsewhere O
- O
present N
us H
with O
a O
dilemma N
. O

According O
to O
its O
President H
, O
it O
is O
in O
a O
position N
to O
do O
so O
. O

My H
Group N
believes O
that O
since O
a O
Parliament N
is O
meant O
to O
listen O
, O
debate N
and O
reflect O
, O
there O
can O
be O
no O
justification N
whatsoever O
for O
this O
delay N
and O
we H
believe O
that O
, O
if O
the O
Commission N
is O
ready O
to O
do O
so O
, O
we H
still O
have O
time N
to O
re-establish O
the O
original O
agreement N
between O
Parliament N
and O
the O
Commission N
and O
proceed O
in O
a O
manner N
which O
fulfils O
our H
duty N
to O
our H
fellow H
citizens H
. O

on O
the O
pretext N
that O
there O
is O
no O
text N
, O
on O
the O
one N
hand N
, O
the O
President H
of O
the O
Commission N
would O
be O
denied O
his O
right O
to O
speak O
in O
this O
Parliament N
and O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand N
, O
there O
would O
be O
a O
debate N
on O
a O
reform N
when O
Parliament N
had O
no O
prior O
knowledge N
of O
the O
texts N
on O
which O
it O
is O
based O
. O

Therefore O
, O
Madam H
President H
, O
I H
would O
ask O
you H
to O
request N
that O
the O
Commission N
express O
its O
opinion N
on O
this O
issue N
and O
that O
we H
then O
proceed O
to O
the O
vote N
. O

( O
Applause N
from O
the O
PSE O
Group N
) O
. O

I H
was O
told O
that O
large O
sections N
of O
the O
Socialist H
Group N
were O
also O
keen O
to O
have O
this O
item N
taken O
off O
the O
agenda N
, O
because O
at O
the O
vote N
in O
the O
Conference N
of O
Presidents H
no O
vote N
was O
received O
from O
the O
working O
group N
of O
Members H
of O
the O
Socialist H
Group N
responsible O
for O
this O
matter N
. O

I H
do O
not O
know O
whether O
this O
information N
is O
correct O
, O
but O
the O
PPE O
- O
DE O
Group N
would O
, O
in O
any O
case N
, O
be O
grateful O
if O
this O
item N
were O
removed O
because O
Parliament N
has O
addressed O
this O
issue N
several O
times N
already O
. O

Decisions N
have O
also O
been O
adopted O
against O
a O
tax N
of O
this O
kind N
. O

That O
is O
why O
my H
Group N
moves O
that O
this O
item N
be O
taken O
off O
the O
agenda N
. O

Thank O
you H
, O
Mr N
Poettering O
. O

We H
shall O
now O
hear O
Mr N
Wurtz O
speaking O
against O
this O
request N
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
I H
would O
firstly O
like O
to O
point N
out H
Mr N
Poettering O
's H
lack N
of O
logic N
. O

It O
is O
not O
a O
lot N
to O
ask O
. O

We H
shall O
proceed O
to O
vote N
on O
the O
PPE O
- O
DE O
Group N
's H
request N
that O
the O
oral O
question N
regarding O
the O
capital N
tax N
be O
withdrawn O
from O
the O
agenda N
. O

( O
Parliament N
rejected O
the O
request N
, O
with O
164 O
votes N
for O
, O
166 O
votes N
against O
and O
7 O
abstentions N
) O
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
I H
would O
like O
to O
thank O
Mr N
Poettering O
for O
advertising N
this O
debate N
. O

Thank O
you H
very O
much O
. O

My H
vote N
was O
" O
in O
favour N
" O
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
the O
Presidency N
has O
already O
declared O
the O
result N
of O
the O
vote N
. O

There O
is O
no O
room N
for O
amendments N
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
in O
the O
earlier O
vote N
- O
and O
I H
will O
abide O
by O
your H
ruling N
on O
this O
matter N
- O
on O
the O
question N
of O
the O
strategic O
plan N
of O
the O
Commission N
I H
indicated O
that O
I H
would O
like O
to O
speak O
in O
advance N
of O
the O
vote N
on O
behalf N
of O
my H
Group N
. O

I H
would O
appreciate O
it O
if O
, O
on O
the O
close O
of O
this O
item N
of O
business N
, O
I H
might O
be O
allowed O
to O
give O
an O
explanation N
of O
vote N
on O
behalf N
of O
my H
Group N
. O

This O
is O
an O
important O
matter N
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
I H
do O
not O
wish O
to O
reopen O
the O
debate N
, O
but O
I H
had O
also O
asked O
for O
the O
floor N
, O
to O
comment O
on O
Mr N
Barón O
Crespo O
's H
motion N
. O

You H
did O
not O
call O
me H
either O
. O

I H
regret O
this O
, O
but O
the O
vote N
has O
already O
been O
taken O
and O
the O
decision N
is O
made O
so O
let O
us H
leave O
the O
matter N
there O
. O

Even O
so O
, O
I H
think O
the O
positions N
are O
quite O
clear N
and O
they O
shall O
be O
entered O
in O
the O
Minutes N
. O

When O
we H
adopt O
the O
Minutes N
for O
today N
's H
sitting O
tomorrow N
, O
then O
any O
Members H
who O
think O
the O
positions N
have O
not O
been O
explained O
clearly O
enough O
may O
ask O
for O
amendments N
. O

This O
seems O
to O
me H
to O
be O
a O
workable O
solution N
. O

Of O
course N
, O
the O
Minutes N
for O
tomorrow N
's H
sitting O
will O
take O
into O
account O
any O
additional O
explanations N
. O

I H
think O
this O
is O
a O
better O
solution N
than O
proceeding O
now O
to O
extremely O
time-consuming O
explanations N
of O
votes N
. O

Mr N
Cox H
, O
Mr N
Hänsch O
, O
would O
this O
be O
acceptable O
to O
you H
? O

Madam H
President H
, O
if O
the O
vote N
records N
correctly O
how O
my H
Group N
voted O
I H
shall O
not O
, O
and O
cannot O
can O
not O
, O
object N
to O
that O
. O

If O
your H
ruling N
is O
that O
I H
cannot O
can O
not O
give O
an O
explanation N
of O
vote N
, O
I H
accept O
that O
but O
accept O
with O
reservations N
. O

If O
they O
do O
not O
properly O
reflect O
the O
positions N
adopted O
, O
then O
we H
may O
correct O
them O
, O
if O
necessary O
. O

( O
The O
order O
of O
business N
was O
adopted O
thus O
amended O
) O
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
we H
cannot O
can O
not O
and O
must O
not O
accept O
the O
fact N
that O
we H
hear O
ever O
more O
frequently O
of O
accidents N
causing O
major O
damage N
on O
our H
roads N
, O
but O
also O
on O
our H
railways N
and O
waterways N
, O
not O
solely O
but O
at O
least O
partly O
because O
those O
involved O
do O
not O
take O
the O
transport N
of O
dangerous O
goods N
seriously O
enough O
or O
because O
- O
as O
a O
result N
of O
ignorance N
or O
a O
lack N
of O
training N
on O
the O
part N
of O
the O
drivers N
or O
others O
responsible O
for O
the O
various O
vehicles N
- O
a O
minor O
accident N
has O
all O
too O
often O
become O
a O
major O
disaster N
. O

As O
an O
Austrian H
, O
I H
still O
have O
a O
vivid O
memory N
, O
as O
, O
I H
believe O
, O
we H
all O
do O
, O
of O
the O
catastrophe N
which O
cost O
so O
many O
human O
lives O
last O
year N
in O
the O
Tauern O
Tunnel N
, O
where O
subsequent O
work N
to O
rebuild O
the O
parts N
of O
the O
tunnel N
which O
had O
been O
destroyed O
in O
this O
fire N
continued O
for O
many O
months N
at O
huge O
expense N
. O

The O
renovation N
project N
, O
which O
lasted O
for O
months N
, O
cut O
off O
this O
important O
route N
between O
the O
north O
and O
south O
of O
Europe O
. O

The O
traffic N
which O
had O
to O
be O
diverted O
because O
of O
this O
stretched O
the O
patience N
of O
many O
thousands N
of O
people N
in O
the O
EU O
to O
the O
limit O
. O

In O
fact N
, O
all O
hell N
broke O
loose O
in O
some O
municipalities N
in O
my H
province N
. O

Prevention N
has O
to O
be O
our H
answer N
to O
disasters N
of O
this O
kind N
and O
this O
draft N
Directive N
is O
an O
important O
step O
towards O
well O
- O
trained O
safety N
advisers H
being O
available O
, O
so O
that O
the O
right O
action N
is O
taken O
in O
good O
time N
. O

All O
the O
same O
, O
we H
must O
not O
content N
ourselves H
with O
enacting O
European O
law N
to O
ensure O
greater O
safety N
. O

We H
also O
need O
to O
follow O
this O
up O
and O
make O
sure O
that O
our H
rules N
are O
transposed O
by O
the O
Member N
States O
in O
good O
time N
and O
- O
even O
more O
importantly O
- O
we H
need O
to O
ensure O
that O
they O
are O
also O
applied O
afterwards O
. O

We H
must O
not O
content N
ourselves H
with O
sealing O
another O
hole N
in O
the O
safety N
net O
and O
shutting O
our H
eyes N
to O
the O
fact N
that O
, O
where O
transport N
safety N
in O
Europe O
is O
concerned O
, O
there O
is O
still O
much O
more O
to O
be O
done O
. O

In O
this O
context N
, O
I H
should O
like O
to O
make O
a O
request N
and O
ask O
the O
Commissioner H
responsible O
, O
who O
is O
with O
us H
here O
today N
, O
to O
table N
an O
appropriate O
text N
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
with O
a O
view N
to O
continuing O
to O
make O
it O
safer O
for O
traffic N
to O
transit N
tunnels N
in O
the O
future N
, O
so O
that O
we H
in O
Europe O
do O
not O
have O
to O
experience N
any O
more O
such O
disasters N
on O
this O
scale N
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
first O
of O
all O
I H
should O
like O
to O
thank O
Mr N
Koch H
for O
his O
report N
which O
has O
, O
at O
its O
heart N
, O
the O
issue N
of O
transport N
safety N
. O

I H
congratulate O
him O
on O
his O
excellent O
report N
. O

the O
Paddington O
rail N
crash O
in O
London O
, O
the O
terrible O
rail N
crash O
in O
Norway O
, O
the O
two O
aviation N
crashes N
involving O
EU O
citizens H
and O
the O
natural O
disaster N
involving O
the O
Erika O
off O
Brittany H
- O
all O
within O
the O
last O
four O
months N
- O
remind O
us H
that O
transport N
safety N
can O
never O
be O
taken O
for O
granted O
and O
that O
those O
charged O
with O
protecting O
the O
public O
must O
be O
highly O
motivated O
and O
highly O
qualified O
. O

The O
rapporteur H
has O
pointed O
out H
to O
the O
House O
that O
in O
its O
common O
position N
the O
Council N
has O
accepted O
six O
of O
Parliament N
's H
ten O
amendments N
put O
forward O
at O
first O
reading O
and O
that O
the O
substance N
of O
Parliament N
's H
other O
amendments N
has O
been O
retained O
. O

My H
Group N
will O
therefore O
support N
the O
common O
position N
and O
looks O
forward O
to O
the O
enactment N
of O
the O
legislation N
which O
will O
provide O
us H
with O
yet O
another O
tool N
in O
our H
fight N
to O
make O
transport N
in O
the O
European O
Union O
as O
safe O
as O
possible O
. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
safety N
my H
Group N
will O
always O
support N
any O
initiatives N
to O
improve O
transport N
safety N
. O

We H
still O
have O
a O
lot N
of O
work N
to O
do O
in O
this O
area N
as O
recent O
events N
have O
proved O
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
I H
would O
like O
to O
make O
a O
few O
comments N
. O

I H
would O
like O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
to O
thank O
the O
rapporteur H
for O
his O
exceptionally O
accurate O
and O
technical O
work N
on O
the O
report N
and O
, O
secondly O
, O
the O
Commission N
for O
the O
proposal N
it O
has O
submitted O
. O

We H
are O
concerned O
here O
with O
the O
harmonisation N
of O
examination N
requirements N
but O
also O
, O
in O
fact N
, O
with O
minimum O
requirements N
. O

This O
is O
important O
, O
but O
so O
is O
enforcement N
and O
there O
are O
, O
of O
course N
, O
a O
number N
of O
reasons N
why O
we H
need O
to O
pay O
particular O
attention N
to O
this O
. O

Or H
ships N
from O
Eastern O
Europe O
which O
moor O
adjacent O
to O
ships N
over O
here O
, O
with O
all O
the O
obvious O
risks N
that O
this O
entails O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it O
has O
transpired O
that O
research N
in O
the O
ports N
in O
Belgium O
, O
Finland O
, O
but O
also O
in O
Japan O
has O
shown O
that O
50 O
% O
of O
containers N
with O
partially O
dangerous O
cargo N
are O
not O
delivered O
correctly O
for O
shipment N
. O

In O
short O
, O
the O
issue N
is O
an O
important O
one N
. O

If O
we H
look O
at O
the O
situation N
where O
safety N
advisers H
are O
concerned O
, O
in O
a O
number N
of O
countries N
it O
is O
compulsory O
to O
employ O
such O
safety N
advisers H
in O
companies N
as O
from O
1 O
January O
of O
this O
year N
. O

There O
will O
be O
major O
problems N
with O
enforcing O
this O
rule N
at O
present N
, O
especially O
with O
smaller O
companies N
, O
as O
these O
cannot O
can O
not O
afford O
safety N
advisors H
. O

These O
smaller O
companies N
either O
dispose O
of O
their O
cargo N
or O
mix N
it O
with O
other O
cargo N
, O
which O
causes N
problems N
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
also O
being O
requested O
that O
ISO O
9002 O
certificates N
possibly O
include O
the O
finer O
details N
of O
these O
activities N
in O
the O
form N
of O
annual O
reports N
and O
company N
analyses N
. O

The O
work N
is O
done O
. O

I H
would O
like O
to O
mention N
one N
final O
point N
. O

With O
regard N
to O
enforcement N
, O
proper O
agreements N
must O
also O
be O
concluded O
with O
the O
Eastern O
European O
countries N
because O
they O
will O
not O
enter O
into O
treaties N
which O
deal O
with O
this O
matter N
until O
1 O
July O
2001 O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
in O
eighteen O
months N
' O
time N
. O

This O
gives O
them O
a O
competitive O
edge N
for O
the O
interim O
period N
. O

This O
is O
not O
in O
itself O
anything O
dreadful O
, O
but O
we H
should O
prioritise O
particularly O
the O
safety N
aspects N
for O
goods N
transported O
by O
road N
, O
rail N
and O
inland O
waterways N
and O
incorporate O
these O
, O
as O
part N
of O
the O
acquis O
communautaire O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
and O
present N
them O
to O
the O
acceding O
states N
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
the O
importance N
of O
transport N
safety N
is O
highlighted O
on O
a O
regular O
basis N
in O
this O
Parliament N
and O
rightly O
so O
. O

The O
ever O
increasing O
volume N
of O
goods N
passing O
through O
Europe O
entails O
all O
kinds N
of O
risks N
, O
known O
and O
unknown O
, O
for O
employees H
and O
the O
social O
environment N
. O

Those O
having O
to O
deal O
with O
these O
risks N
should O
therefore O
meet O
stringent O
requirements N
. O

The O
relevant O
standards N
which O
have O
been O
laid O
down O
in O
another O
Directive N
, O
95 O
/ O
35 O
/ O
EC O
, O
seem O
sufficiently O
adequate O
to O
advise O
people N
in O
a O
responsible O
manner N
on O
the O
organisation N
of O
the O
transport N
of O
dangerous O
goods N
. O

I H
am O
very O
pleased O
that O
agreement N
has O
also O
been O
reached O
with O
the O
Council N
on O
minimum O
standards N
regarding O
examinations N
, O
although O
I H
would O
have O
preferred O
it O
if O
uniform N
, O
set O
standards N
and O
modules N
had O
been O
established O
, O
so O
that O
certificates N
would O
be O
of O
equal O
value N
internationally O
. O

This O
, O
however O
, O
does O
not O
seem O
feasible O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
amendment N
tabled O
by O
the O
rapporteur H
is O
perfectly O
logical O
and O
I H
can O
, O
therefore O
, O
give O
it O
my H
wholehearted O
support N
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
Commissioner H
, O
I H
should O
first O
like O
to O
congratulate O
Mr N
Koch H
on O
his O
reports N
which O
, O
though O
technical O
, O
are O
nonetheless O
of O
very O
great O
significance N
for O
safety N
. O

I H
should O
like O
to O
make O
just O
a O
few O
comments N
. O

Firstly O
, O
I H
should O
like O
to O
ask O
the O
Commissioner H
- O
and O
I H
am O
convinced O
that O
my H
request N
will O
fall N
on O
fertile O
ground N
- O
to O
ensure O
that O
more O
attention N
is O
paid O
to O
the O
issue N
of O
safety N
, O
be O
it O
on O
the O
roads N
, O
on O
the O
waterways N
or O
at O
sea N
. O

Considering O
that O
it O
is O
only O
today N
that O
we H
are O
dealing O
with O
a O
Commission N
proposal N
first O
made O
on O
19 O
March O
1998 O
, O
even O
though O
Parliament N
responded O
relatively O
quickly O
, O
this O
time N
lag N
is O
a O
little O
too O
long O
. O

My H
second N
point N
has O
already O
been O
mentioned O
: O

In O
principle N
, O
I H
believe O
that O
in O
many O
cases N
where O
transport N
is O
concerned O
we H
should O
be O
working O
towards O
increased O
flexibility N
and O
country N
- O
specific O
rules N
. O

However O
, O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
safety N
, O
I H
am O
rather O
sceptical O
because O
safety N
in O
Sweden O
, O
for O
example N
, O
is O
in O
principle N
no O
different O
from O
safety N
in O
Germany H
, O
Italy O
or O
Austria O
. O

Should O
flexibility N
of O
this O
kind N
result N
in O
there O
being O
inadequate O
rules N
in O
some O
countries N
then O
we H
should O
work N
towards O
greater O
harmonisation N
. O

My H
third O
point N
has O
also O
been O
mentioned O
already O
. O

As O
you H
know O
, O
like O
Mr N
Rack O
, O
I H
come O
from O
a O
transit N
country N
, O
where O
this O
issue N
plays N
a O
particularly O
important O
role N
. O

We H
do O
not O
want O
to O
make O
the O
conditions N
of O
competition N
worse O
for O
some O
countries N
unilaterally O
and O
improve O
them O
for O
countries N
such O
as O
Austria O
or O
other O
transit N
countries N
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
I H
would O
firstly O
like O
to O
congratulate O
the O
rapporteur H
, O
Mr N
Koch H
, O
on O
his O
magnificent O
work N
and O
his O
positive N
cooperation N
with O
the O
Commission N
with O
regard N
to O
improving O
the O
texts N
and O
presenting O
this O
report N
and O
this O
proposal N
; O

in O
the O
end N
there O
is O
only O
one N
amendment N
on O
the O
requirements N
for O
the O
aptitude N
examination N
for O
safety N
advisers H
in O
the O
transport N
of O
dangerous O
goods N
by O
road N
, O
rail N
or O
inland O
waterway N
. O

We H
understand O
that O
it O
is O
important O
that O
the O
two O
institutions N
- O
Parliament N
and O
Commission N
- O
cooperate O
and O
work N
together O
and O
that O
the O
current O
cooperation N
with O
the O
Committee N
on O
Regional O
Policy N
, O
and O
in O
particular O
the O
transport N
group N
, O
is O
magnificent O
. O

The O
common O
position N
includes O
practically O
all O
of O
the O
amendments N
accepted O
by O
the O
Commission N
and O
harmonises O
the O
minimum O
examination N
requirements N
for O
safety N
advisers H
and O
, O
at O
second N
reading O
, O
we H
can O
accept O
the O
amendment N
on O
the O
proposed O
date N
, O
which O
is O
much O
more O
realistic O
than O
the O
one N
originally O
suggested O
by O
the O
Commission N
, O
bearing O
in O
mind N
that O
we H
have O
now O
spent O
several O
years N
debating O
this O
question N
. O

Very O
briefly O
, O
I H
would O
like O
to O
thank O
the O
various O
Members H
for O
their O
interventions N
and O
to O
tell O
you H
that O
safety N
is O
one N
of O
the O
Commission N
's H
priorities N
in O
the O
field N
of O
transport N
. O

As O
Mr N
Simpson H
has O
said O
very O
correctly O
, O
this O
is O
a O
process N
which O
we H
can O
never O
take O
for O
granted O
or O
regard N
as O
having O
come O
to O
an O
end N
. O

The O
process N
of O
increasing O
safety N
margins N
and O
safety N
guarantees N
in O
transport N
is O
a O
process N
which O
must O
be O
improved O
day N
by O
day N
. O

In O
this O
regard N
, O
I H
would O
also O
like O
to O
refer O
very O
briefly O
to O
the O
problems N
of O
the O
tunnels N
, O
which O
Messrs O
Rack O
and O
Swoboda O
have O
referred O
to O
, O
which O
, O
in O
the O
case N
of O
Austria O
, O
is O
doubtless O
a O
very O
sensitive O
issue N
, O
and O
great O
effort N
should O
be O
made O
to O
improve O
their O
safety N
. O

In O
one N
of O
the O
worst O
accidents N
to O
have O
occurred O
recently O
, O
the O
goods N
being O
transported O
were O
not O
dangerous O
in O
themselves O
. O

Margarine N
and O
a O
few O
kilos N
of O
paint O
which O
, O
in O
principle N
, O
do O
not O
present N
risks N
, O
led O
to O
a O
genuine O
disaster N
. O

Therefore O
, O
we H
will O
have O
to O
see O
how O
the O
requirements N
guaranteeing O
the O
maximum O
degree N
of O
safety N
can O
be O
further O
improved O
. O

Finally O
, O
I H
would O
like O
to O
say O
that O
we H
have O
to O
consider O
safety N
in O
all O
types N
of O
transport N
. O

This O
week N
we H
will O
be O
holding O
a O
debate N
here O
on O
the O
safety N
of O
sea N
transport N
, O
in O
light N
of O
the O
Erika O
disaster N
, O
and O
in O
the O
course N
of O
this O
year N
we H
will O
have O
to O
discuss O
our H
objectives N
in O
terms N
of O
the O
safety N
of O
air N
transport N
. O

But O
I H
would O
like O
to O
say O
that O
safety N
is O
a O
priority N
objective N
for O
the O
Commission N
. O

As O
I H
will O
say O
in O
the O
debate N
on O
the O
Erika O
disaster N
, O
we H
do O
not O
wait N
until O
there O
is O
a O
disaster N
to O
deal O
with O
the O
question N
of O
safety N
, O
but O
we H
work N
on O
it O
even O
when O
there O
are O
no O
such O
circumstances N
, O
which O
simply O
serve O
to O
demonstrate O
the O
urgency N
for O
an O
effective O
response N
to O
this O
type N
of O
problem N
. O

I H
would O
like O
to O
repeat O
my H
appreciation N
to O
all O
the O
speakers H
and O
especially O
to O
the O
rapporteur H
, O
Mr N
Koch H
. O

The O
debate N
is O
closed O
. O

The O
vote N
will O
take O
place N
tomorrow N
at O
12 O
p.m. O
. O

of O

Mr N
President H
, O
Commissioner H
, O
ladies H
and O
gentlemen H
, O
the O
Directive N
on O
the O
approximation N
of O
the O
laws N
of O
the O
member N
states N
with O
regard N
to O
the O
transport N
of O
dangerous O
goods N
by O
road N
, O
which O
entered O
into O
force N
on O
1 O
January O
1997 O
, O
contains O
a O
number N
of O
transitional O
provisions N
which O
are O
only O
valid O
for O
a O
limited O
period N
of O
time N
, O
the O
term N
of O
validity N
being O
linked O
to O
the O
completion N
of O
specific O
standardisation N
work N
by O
the O
CEN O
, O
that O
is O
the O
European O
committee N
for O
standardisation N
. O

Delays N
in O
the O
CEN O
's H
work N
are O
now O
making O
it O
difficult O
to O
apply O
this O
very O
Directive N
. O

In O
particular O
, O
annexes N
cannot O
can O
not O
be O
adapted O
to O
take O
account O
of O
technical O
and O
industrial O
developments N
. O

I H
regret O
this O
since O
we H
are O
having O
to O
take O
action N
because O
others O
have O
not O
done O
their O
job N
. O

In O
this O
respect N
, O
I H
accept O
this O
proposal N
to O
amend O
Directive N
94 O
/ O
55 O
/ O
EC O
which O
has O
been O
tabled O
for O
discussion N
today N
. O

Should O
the O
European O
Union O
fail O
to O
take O
action N
, O
then O
Member N
States O
would O
be O
obliged O
to O
amend O
their O
national O
legislation N
for O
a O
very O
brief N
period N
, O
until O
the O
CEN O
completes O
its O
work N
, O
which O
would O
cause N
unnecessary O
cost O
and O
uncertainty N
. O

The O
amendment N
to O
the O
Directive N
on O
today N
's H
agenda N
does O
not O
therefore O
affect O
the O
existing O
harmonisation N
of O
the O
transport N
of O
dangerous O
goods N
in O
the O
community N
. O

It O
merely O
prolongs O
transitional O
rules N
by O
postponing O
deadlines N
, O
deletes O
provisions N
which O
are O
no O
longer O
applicable O
, O
and O
lays O
down O
the O
procedures N
for O
a O
) O
carrying O
out H
the O
ad O
hoc O
transportation N
of O
dangerous O
goods N
and O
b O
) O
enacting O
less O
stringent O
national O
regulations N
, O
in O
particular O
for O
the O
transport N
of O
very O
small O
amounts N
of O
dangerous O
goods N
within O
strictly O
defined O
local O
areas N
. O

The O
amendment N
to O
the O
Directive N
is O
consequently O
in O
full O
accordance N
with O
the O
principle N
of O
subsidiarity N
; O

the O
Member N
States O
obtain O
more O
powers N
. O

In O
so O
doing O
, O
it O
is O
supported O
by O
a O
committee N
of O
experts H
on O
the O
transport N
of O
dangerous O
goods N
under O
the O
regulatory O
procedure N
. O

The O
procedures N
for O
the O
exercise N
of O
these O
implementing O
powers N
conferred O
on O
the O
Commission N
were O
laid O
down O
afresh O
in O
the O
Council N
Decision O
of O
June O
1999 O
. O

Two O
of O
the O
amendments N
tabled O
and O
adopted O
unanimously O
by O
the O
committee N
relate O
precisely O
to O
this O
amended O
comitology O
procedure N
. O

We H
would O
like O
to O
ensure O
that O
there O
is O
a O
reference N
to O
this O
as O
early O
as O
the O
recitals N
and O
that O
the O
period N
within O
which O
the O
Council N
has O
to O
make O
a O
decision N
- O
which O
is O
not O
clearly O
worded O
- O
is O
set O
at O
a O
maximum O
of O
three O
months N
. O

In O
addition N
, O
the O
need O
for O
greater O
transparency N
has O
been O
pointed O
out H
. O

A H
final O
amendment N
is O
intended O
to O
ensure O
that O
tanks N
and O
tankers N
put O
into O
service N
between O
1 O
January O
1997 O
and O
the O
entry N
into O
force N
of O
this O
Directive N
may O
continue O
to O
be O
used O
provided O
that O
they O
have O
been O
constructed O
and O
maintained O
in O
accordance N
with O
it O
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
colleagues H
, O
a O
happy O
new O
year N
and O
millennium N
to O
you H
all O
. O

I H
would O
like O
to O
briefly O
comment O
on O
the O
Commission N
's H
proposal N
to O
amend O
the O
Directive N
on O
the O
transport N
of O
dangerous O
goods N
by O
road N
. O

It O
is O
good O
that O
this O
Directive N
should O
be O
established O
now O
, O
as O
, O
otherwise O
, O
member N
states N
would O
have O
to O
amend O
their O
national O
acts N
for O
a O
very O
short O
time N
, O
a O
period N
of O
transition N
, O
which O
would O
again O
mean O
unnecessary O
costs O
and O
which O
would O
once O
more O
increase O
concern N
with O
regard N
to O
EU O
bureaucracy N
. O

My H
amendments N
concern N
the O
frost N
- O
resistance N
ratings N
for O
tankers N
carrying O
these O
dangerous O
goods N
. O

According O
to O
the O
Commission N
's H
proposal N
-20º O
C N
would O
have O
been O
sufficient O
. O

On O
the O
shores N
of O
the O
Mediterranean N
, O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
imagine O
that O
in O
Lapland O
temperatures N
can O
fall N
considerably O
lower O
than O
that O
. O

There O
is O
support N
for O
the O
EU O
in O
Lapland O
also O
, O
so O
let O
us H
remember O
them O
. O

I H
have O
thus O
proposed O
that O
the O
frost N
rating O
be O
lowered O
to O
-40° O
C N
. O

This O
would O
be O
necessary O
to O
keep O
safety N
standards N
at O
the O
level N
they O
were O
in O
northern O
regions N
previously O
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
with O
your H
permission N
I H
should O
like O
to O
begin O
by O
expressing O
my H
admiration N
for O
the O
way N
in O
which O
you H
executed O
the O
quick O
changeover N
of O
the O
chairmanship N
just O
now O
during O
the O
debate N
. O

I H
thought O
that O
it O
was O
quite O
superb O
. O

On O
the O
subject O
at O
hand N
, O
I H
think O
that O
the O
people N
of O
Europe O
must O
be O
able O
to O
be O
confident O
that O
the O
goods N
- O
however O
dangerous O
they O
are O
- O
which O
are O
transported O
on O
Europe O
's H
roads N
, O
railways N
, O
and O
so O
on O
are O
as O
safe O
as O
possible O
. O

This O
Directive N
is O
a O
contribution N
to O
this O
. O

What O
we H
are O
doing O
today N
is O
essentially O
a O
nuisance N
. O

The O
rapporteur H
, O
Mr N
Koch H
, O
to O
whom O
we H
express O
our H
thanks N
for O
the O
work N
which O
he O
has O
done O
on O
this O
, O
has O
already O
pointed O
out H
that O
basically O
everything O
could O
have O
been O
somewhat O
more O
advanced O
had O
it O
not O
been O
for O
the O
inactivity N
on O
the O
part N
of O
the O
CEN O
, O
which O
has O
been O
very O
dilatory O
in O
drawing O
up O
and O
adapting O
the O
Directive N
. O

This O
is O
also O
important O
where O
the O
prerequisites N
for O
the O
internal O
market N
are O
concerned O
. O

If O
we H
are O
to O
get O
a O
common O
transport N
market N
genuinely O
up O
and O
running O
, O
it O
is O
important O
that O
we H
should O
not O
only O
have O
regulations N
but O
that O
these O
regulations N
should O
also O
, O
as O
far O
as O
possible O
, O
apply O
to O
every O
country N
. O

I H
should O
like O
to O
conclude O
by O
commenting O
on O
a O
third O
matter N
which O
is O
also O
of O
significance N
, O
namely O
an O
amendment N
tabled O
by O
Member N
of O
Parliament N
, O
Mr N
Ari H
Vatanen O
. O

By O
approving O
this O
amendment N
, O
we H
take O
account O
of O
the O
fact N
that O
it O
can O
be O
very O
cold O
in O
the O
northern O
parts N
of O
the O
European O
Union O
. O

This O
makes O
it O
necessary O
to O
also O
take O
account O
of O
the O
ways N
in O
which O
materials N
and O
packaging N
are O
affected O
by O
cold O
of O
this O
kind N
. O

It O
is O
good O
that O
, O
in O
establishing O
the O
present N
regulations N
, O
we H
can O
also O
be O
flexible O
. O

I H
hope O
that O
the O
Commission N
is O
able O
to O
accept O
the O
present N
amendment N
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
I H
would O
like O
to O
thank O
not O
only O
Mr N
Koch H
, O
but O
also O
the O
Vice N
- O
President H
of O
the O
Commission N
for O
the O
clear N
and O
unambiguous O
way N
in O
which O
they O
have O
declared O
their O
support N
for O
safety N
in O
the O
transport N
sector N
and O
acknowledged O
it O
as O
a O
priority N
. O

For O
one N
thing N
is O
clear N
: O

We H
all O
regret O
that O
the O
European O
Committee N
for O
Standardisation N
( O
CEN O
) O
has O
not O
been O
able O
, O
in O
the O
required O
time N
, O
to O
carry O
out H
the O
amendment N
of O
the O
provisions N
necessary O
for O
the O
required O
harmonisation N
within O
the O
European O
Union O
. O

This O
debate N
and O
the O
amendment N
of O
the O
Directive N
currently O
in O
force N
allow O
us H
to O
incorporate O
differentiating O
elements N
which O
demonstrate O
the O
diversity N
of O
this O
Europe O
of O
ours H
. O

A H
moment N
ago O
, O
Mr N
Vatanen O
spoke O
to O
us H
of O
lower O
temperatures N
, O
not O
of O
20 O
degrees N
below O
zero O
, O
but O
of O
40 O
degrees N
below O
zero O
. O

Of O
course N
, O
we H
accept O
that O
amendment N
- O
it O
is O
absolutely O
right O
- O
and O
I H
believe O
that O
we H
should O
incorporate O
specific O
circumstances N
which O
demonstrate O
the O
climatic O
diversity N
of O
the O
European O
Union O
, O
which O
sometimes O
take O
the O
form N
of O
specifics N
and O
of O
concrete O
requirements N
for O
the O
establishment N
of O
standards N
and O
characterisations N
of O
a O
technical O
nature N
. O

I H
would O
like O
to O
say O
, O
with O
regard N
to O
Mr N
Swoboda O
's H
comments N
on O
the O
activity N
of O
the O
CEN O
, O
that O
we H
are O
urging O
them O
to O
speed N
up O
their O
work N
as O
much O
as O
possible O
because O
it O
would O
be O
terrible O
if O
, O
despite O
the O
new O
deadline N
, O
we H
were O
to O
find O
ourselves H
after O
a O
year N
and O
a O
bit N
with O
the O
same O
difficulties N
because O
their O
work N
has O
not O
been O
concluded O
. O

The O
Commission N
accepts O
all O
of O
the O
contributions N
of O
the O
parliamentary O
committee N
and O
the O
rapporteur H
, O
Mr N
Koch H
, O
which O
are O
contained O
in O
the O
various O
amendments N
, O
specifically O
four O
. O

We H
therefore O
accept O
the O
four O
amendments N
which O
have O
been O
proposed O
. O

The O

item N

the O
report N
( O
A5-0108 O
/ O
1999 O
) O
by O
Mrs N
Schroedter O
, O
on O
behalf N
of O
the O
Committee N
on O
Regional O
Policy N
, O
Transport N
and O
Tourism N
, O
on O
the O
communication N
from O
the O
Commission N
in O
the O
field N
of O
the O
Structural O
Funds N
and O
their O
coordination N
with O
the O
Cohesion N
Fund N
: O

Mr N
President H
, O
it O
is O
particularly O
pleasing O
for O
me H
to O
make O
my H
first O
speech N
in O
the O
European O
Parliament N
on O
what O
is O
regarded O
as O
the O
most O
important O
issue N
within O
that O
part N
of O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
that O
I H
represent O
in O
this O
Parliament N
, O
namely O
Wales O
. O

A H
major O
part N
of O
Wales O
, O
as O
you H
know O
, O
has O
been O
granted O
Objective N
1 O
status N
under O
the O
Structural O
Funds N
programme N
. O

It O
is O
quite O
clear N
that O
many O
people N
within O
Wales O
are O
looking O
to O
the O
European O
Structural O
Funds N
programme N
to O
alleviate O
some O
of O
the O
great O
difficulties N
that O
we H
undoubtedly O
face N
. O

We H
have O
seen O
the O
gap N
between O
rich O
and O
poor O
widen O
. O

We H
are O
looking O
, O
therefore O
, O
within O
the O
Structural O
Funds N
programme N
not O
just O
to O
see O
industrial O
restructuring O
but O
also O
to O
see O
a O
wider O
improvement N
in O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
economic O
base N
within O
the O
Principality N
. O

That O
is O
why O
I H
want O
to O
highlight O
some O
of O
the O
issues N
that O
I H
believe O
the O
Commission N
must O
have O
at O
the O
forefront N
. O

We H
look O
to O
the O
Commission N
to O
deal O
with O
points O
in O
relation N
to O
additionality O
. O

We H
are O
dissatisfied O
with O
the O
fact N
that O
those O
figures N
seem O
to O
have O
been O
in O
some O
way N
hidden O
within O
UK O
figures N
. O

We H
look O
to O
the O
Commission N
also O
to O
ensure O
that O
there O
is O
matched O
funding N
for O
projects N
. O

We H
look O
to O
it O
to O
challenge N
the O
UK O
Government O
, O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
private O
sector N
, O
which O
surely O
must O
be O
providing O
the O
major O
impetus N
for O
Structural O
Funds N
expenditure N
, O
is O
involved O
in O
the O
planning O
stage N
. O

Finally O
, O
we H
ask O
that O
the O
Commission N
ensures O
that O
Structural O
Fund N
monies N
are O
spent O
in O
a O
way N
which O
is O
transparent O
. O

Too O
much O
of O
what O
takes O
place N
within O
this O
Parliament N
is O
not O
transparent O
. O

This O
is O
one N
area N
in O
which O
I H
believe O
the O
Commission N
can O
be O
a O
very O
great O
friend H
to O
Wales O
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
our H
committee N
views N
these O
issues N
very O
differently O
and O
, O
to O
start O
, O
I H
will O
speak O
from O
the O
point N
of O
view N
of O
research N
. O

We H
see O
it O
as O
a O
very O
positive N
sign N
that O
, O
in O
her O
own O
conclusions N
, O
the O
rapporteur H
has O
taken O
account O
of O
our H
committee N
's H
proposal N
that O
the O
Cohesion N
Fund N
countries N
should O
broaden O
the O
research N
infrastructure N
by O
locating O
universities N
and O
colleges N
in O
such O
a O
way N
that O
they O
would O
serve O
those O
who O
live O
in O
undeveloped O
regions N
better O
than O
now O
and O
make O
it O
easier O
for O
educated O
people N
to O
remain O
in O
their O
home N
districts N
. O

Another O
matter N
we H
would O
like O
to O
address N
, O
specifically O
from O
the O
point N
of O
view N
of O
industrial O
policy N
, O
is O
that O
we H
would O
have O
liked O
the O
Commission N
to O
pay O
more O
attention N
to O
the O
effects N
of O
services N
, O
electronic O
commerce N
and O
the O
growing O
use H
of O
the O
Internet N
, O
when O
they O
were O
planning O
the O
coordination N
of O
Structural O
Funds N
and O
Cohesion N
Funds N
. O

Poverty N
and O
wealth N
used O
to O
depend O
more O
on O
means N
of O
livelihood N
. O

In O
my H
opinion N
the O
committee N
drafting O
the O
report N
has O
not O
taken O
sufficient O
account O
of O
this O
, O
so O
on O
behalf N
of O
the O
Committee N
on O
Industry N
, O
External O
Trade N
, O
Research O
and O
Energy N
, O
I H
would O
draw O
the O
Commission N
's H
attention N
to O
this O
issue N
. O

Finally O
, O
as O
the O
committee N
representing O
energy N
, O
we H
would O
have O
liked O
the O
issue N
of O
support N
for O
renewable O
energy N
resources N
from O
Cohesion N
and O
Regional O
Development N
funds N
to O
have O
been O
emphasised O
still O
more O
, O
thus O
, O
through O
a O
process N
of O
coordination N
, O
increasing O
the O
use H
of O
renewables O
so O
that O
the O
scant O
funding N
resources N
in O
the O
energy N
programme N
might O
have O
been O
compensated O
by O
means N
of O
these O
more O
substantial O
sums N
. O

I H
would O
like O
to O
draw O
people N
's H
attention N
to O
Amendments N
Nos N
1 O
and O
2 O
which O
were O
agreed O
by O
the O
Committee N
on O
Employment N
and O
Social O
Affairs N
but O
not O
accepted O
by O
the O
Committee N
on O
Regional O
Policy N
, O
Transport N
and O
Tourism N
. O

These O
amendments N
deal O
with O
the O
social O
economy N
and O
the O
need O
to O
provide O
social O
risk N
capital N
and O
support N
financially O
local O
schemes N
to O
develop O
employment N
opportunities N
and O
strengthen O
social O
cohesion N
. O

In O
the O
past N
, O
this O
Parliament N
has O
viewed O
the O
social O
economy N
as O
an O
important O
potential N
provider H
of O
employment N
. O

These O
amendments N
also O
fit O
in O
with O
this O
Parliament N
's H
view N
that O
social O
exclusion N
is O
a O
serious O
issue N
needing O
constructive O
action N
. O

We H
hope O
that O
those O
considering O
rejection N
of O
these O
amendments N
have O
very O
powerful O
reasons N
to O
offer O
to O
both O
Parliament N
and O
their O
citizens H
who O
are O
seeking O
employment N
. O

In O
her O
report N
, O
Mrs N
Flautre O
also O
drew O
attention N
to O
an O
area N
where O
coordination N
is O
sorely O
lacking O
, O
yet O
desperately O
needed O
. O

The O
Commission N
proposals N
refer O
to O
the O
four O
pillars N
of O
employment N
strategy N
and O
the O
five O
fields N
of O
action N
of O
the O
European O
Social O
Fund N
. O

It O
could O
be O
said O
that O
the O
omission N
gives O
the O
impression N
that O
the O
Commission N
too O
has O
no O
idea N
how O
to O
provide O
maximum O
coordination N
between O
European O
Social O
Fund N
assistance N
, O
which O
is O
subject O
to O
review N
after O
three O
and O
a O
half O
years N
, O
and O
the O
Member N
States O
' O
annual O
national O
plans N
for O
employment N
. O

We H
hope O
that O
the O
Commission N
can O
reassure O
us H
that O
this O
was O
an O
oversight N
which O
is O
now O
being O
dealt O
with O
constructively O
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
Commissioner H
, O
the O
proposal N
presented O
by O
the O
Commission N
, O
in O
accordance N
with O
its O
mandate N
, O
is O
a O
reasonable O
starting O
point N
for O
the O
Committee N
on O
Agriculture O
and O
Rural O
Development N
. O

I H
would O
like O
to O
point N
out H
, O
however O
, O
that O
this O
starting O
point N
indicates O
to O
us H
the O
challenges N
which O
face N
us H
: O

maintaining O
a O
population N
in O
rural O
areas N
, O
given O
the O
changes N
taking O
place N
in O
all O
types N
of O
economic O
activity N
owing O
to O
agriculture N
's H
increasing O
lack N
of O
importance N
amongst O
the O
various O
sources N
of O
income N
for O
rural O
society N
. O

This O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
deficiencies N
in O
the O
networks N
of O
infrastructures N
and O
services N
and O
a O
generally O
very O
low O
level N
of O
employment N
, O
which O
furthermore O
is O
seasonal O
and O
lacks O
diversity N
, O
exacerbates O
the O
exodus N
from O
rural O
areas N
. O

The O
consequences N
do O
not O
inspire O
hope O
. O

It O
is O
the O
young O
people N
who O
are O
disappearing O
, O
who O
are O
getting O
an O
education N
and O
finding O
work N
outside O
of O
the O
rural O
areas N
, O
all O
of O
which O
has O
an O
unfavourable O
effect N
on O
those O
areas N
. O

This O
lack N
of O
infrastructure N
is O
also O
an O
obstacle N
to O
the O
establishment N
of O
companies N
and O
the O
creation N
of O
jobs N
. O

Agriculture O
only O
provides O
5.5 O
% O
of O
employment N
in O
the O
Union O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
three O
quarters N
of O
our H
farm N
workers H
are O
part-time O
and O
require O
supplements N
to O
their O
incomes N
. O

For O
this O
reason N
, O
one N
of O
the O
most O
important O
and O
essential O
objectives N
which O
we H
should O
set O
in O
the O
European O
Union O
is O
to O
make O
efforts N
to O
create O
new O
jobs N
in O
rural O
areas N
, O
outside O
of O
the O
agricultural O
sector N
, O
in O
sectors N
such O
as O
rural O
tourism N
, O
sport N
, O
culture N
, O
heritage N
conservation N
, O
the O
conversion N
of O
businesses N
, O
new O
technologies N
, O
services N
, O
etc. O
. O

However O
, O
even O
though O
the O
role N
of O
agriculture N
is O
not O
exclusive O
, O
it O
is O
still O
essential O
, O
not O
only O
to O
prevent O
economic O
and O
social O
disintegration N
and O
the O
creation N
of O
ghost H
towns N
, O
but O
also O
because O
farmers H
play O
a O
fundamental O
role N
in O
managing O
the O
land O
, O
in O
preserving O
biodiversity N
and O
in O
protecting O
the O
environment N
. O

It O
is O
important O
to O
prioritise O
general O
criteria N
for O
land O
planning O
and O
demographic O
equilibrium N
, O
and O
to O
bear O
in O
mind N
the O
conclusions N
of O
the O
Committee N
on O
Agriculture O
and O
Rural O
Development N
on O
the O
five O
fundamental O
issues N
, O
which O
have O
been O
only O
partly O
taken O
up O
by O
the O
Committee N
on O
Transport N
, O
Regional O
Policy N
and O
Tourism N
in O
its O
points O
16 O
and O
17 O
. O

In O
conclusion N
, O
I H
would O
ask O
the O
Commission N
to O
take O
these O
five O
points O
into O
account O
when O
establishing O
the O
conclusions N
on O
the O
four O
pillars N
because O
I H
believe O
that O
, O
for O
the O
European O
Union O
, O
maintaining O
the O
population N
in O
rural O
areas N
must O
be O
one N
of O
the O
priority N
objectives N
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
Commissioner H
, O
I H
would O
like O
to O
begin O
by O
thanking O
Mrs N
Schroedter O
, O
the O
rapporteur H
, O
for O
her O
work N
. O

I H
would O
also O
like O
to O
thank O
her O
for O
her O
willingness N
to O
enter O
into O
dialogue N
with O
the O
other O
political O
groups N
when O
compromise N
formulas N
have O
needed O
to O
be O
reached O
in O
the O
face N
of O
this O
avalanche N
of O
amendments N
- O
and O
perhaps O
there O
are O
more O
of O
them O
than O
we H
expected O
- O
but O
which O
genuinely O
reflect O
the O
importance N
of O
the O
report N
we H
are O
now O
discussing O
. O

We H
feel O
that O
it O
is O
important O
that O
the O
Commission N
takes O
account O
of O
the O
conclusions N
adopted O
by O
this O
Parliament N
, O
at O
least O
in O
spirit N
, O
because O
at O
this O
stage N
, O
it O
might O
seem O
as O
though O
what O
we H
are O
doing O
here O
is O
a O
useless O
exercise N
, O
and O
nothing N
but O
hot O
air N
. O

In O
our H
amendments N
, O
we H
have O
stated O
the O
importance N
of O
the O
necessary O
synergies N
being O
produced O
between O
the O
Structural O
Funds N
, O
the O
Cohesion N
Fund N
and O
Community N
initiatives N
, O
so O
that O
their O
application N
should O
be O
reflected O
, O
in O
the O
best O
and O
most O
profitable O
way N
, O
by O
the O
gradual O
elimination N
of O
disparities N
between O
regions N
and O
by O
the O
creation N
of O
jobs N
which O
are O
, O
when O
all O
is O
said O
and O
done O
, O
the O
two O
central O
purposes N
of O
the O
funds N
we H
are O
discussing O
. O

In O
order O
to O
achieve O
a O
more O
rapid O
and O
efficient O
boost N
for O
attaining O
these O
objectives N
, O
we H
think O
that O
those O
who O
generate O
employment N
, O
the O
real O
entrepreneurs H
and O
those O
who O
really O
guarantee N
new O
sources N
of O
employment N
, O
that O
is O
, O
businesspeople N
, O
must O
participate O
in O
this O
initiative N
. O

Small O
and O
medium-sized O
businesses N
, O
above O
all O
, O
need O
to O
take O
part N
in O
the O
distribution N
of O
these O
funds N
. O

If O
they O
do O
not O
, O
if O
businesspeople N
feel O
marginalised O
, O
if O
entrepreneurs H
cannot O
can O
not O
take O
part N
, O
not O
only O
in O
managing O
but O
also O
in O
receiving O
these O
funds N
, O
we H
will O
have O
missed O
an O
opportunity N
to O
attain O
our H
objectives N
more O
rapidly O
. O

Also O
, O
in O
order O
to O
attain O
our H
objectives N
, O
to O
overcome O
the O
disparities N
between O
regions N
and O
to O
seek O
out H
sources N
of O
employment N
, O
it O
is O
crucial O
to O
give O
our H
complete O
support N
to O
new O
technologies N
, O
to O
transport N
and O
communications N
networks N
and O
to O
renewable O
energies N
. O

All O
of O
this O
must O
be O
done O
- O
I H
repeat O
- O
with O
the O
participation N
of O
private O
business N
, O
which O
, O
by O
uniting O
its O
efforts N
with O
those O
of O
public O
administrations N
, O
but O
complementing O
them O
, O
never O
obstructing O
or O
excluding O
them O
, O
will O
lead O
to O
the O
creation N
of O
wealth N
in O
society N
and O
of O
jobs N
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
it O
is O
incumbent O
upon O
me H
to O
remind O
my H
colleague H
, O
Mr N
Evans H
, O
of O
why O
Wales O
actually O
achieved O
Objective N
1 O
status N
. O

It O
was O
because O
of O
the O
discredited O
policies N
of O
his O
own O
Conservative O
Party O
. O

Let O
me H
also O
remind O
him O
that O
when O
his O
party N
leader H
, O
Mr N
Hague H
, O
was O
Secretary H
of O
State N
for O
Wales O
, O
he O
broke O
every O
rule N
in O
the O
book O
on O
additionality O
which O
led O
to O
a O
stern O
letter N
from O
Commissioner H
Wulf O
- O
Mathies O
regarding O
regulatory O
requirements N
. O

I H
can O
tell O
you H
that O
the O
British O
Government O
is O
aware O
of O
its O
regulatory O
requirements N
on O
Objective N
1 O
additionality O
. O

I H
suggest O
Mr N
Evans H
goes O
back O
and O
reads O
the O
Regulation N
. O

My H
Group N
has O
made O
extensive O
amendments N
to O
both O
reports N
up O
for O
debate N
today N
. O

I H
want O
to O
focus O
our H
minds N
on O
the O
essential O
role N
of O
the O
guidelines N
. O

It O
is O
important O
to O
identify O
the O
skills N
and O
potential N
of O
our H
regions N
in O
the O
hi-tech O
sector N
. O

It O
is O
particularly O
important O
in O
the O
light N
of O
reports N
in O
the O
media N
that O
Europe O
is O
rapidly O
losing O
ground N
to O
the O
US O
in O
the O
hi-tech O
growth N
industries N
of O
the O
future N
. O

They O
should O
not O
be O
about O
creating O
additional O
layers N
of O
bureaucracy N
and O
red O
tape N
. O

The O
implementation N
and O
operation N
of O
the O
guidelines N
cannot O
can O
not O
be O
left O
to O
the O
personal O
interpretation N
of O
one N
or O
other O
desk N
officer H
, O
either O
in O
the O
Commission N
or O
in O
the O
civil O
service N
. O

There O
must O
be O
an O
internal O
coherence N
in O
the O
Commission N
directorate N
, O
while O
respecting O
the O
specific O
local O
and O
regional O
aspects N
of O
Commission N
programmes N
. O

The O
conclusion N
is O
that O
we H
must O
make O
the O
case N
for O
guidelines N
to O
be O
broad O
, O
indicative O
and O
flexible O
to O
assist O
our H
programme N
managers H
and O
fund O
- O
users H
and O
to O
get O
the O
maximum O
potential N
out H
of O
our H
new O
fields N
of O
regeneration N
. O

The O
rapporteur H
has O
also O
quite O
rightly O
stated O
that O
Parliament N
was O
not O
heard O
in O
time N
regarding O
the O
guidelines N
. O

Hopefully O
, O
the O
stands O
Parliament N
has O
taken O
will O
help O
, O
however O
, O
in O
the O
mid O
- O
term N
appraisal N
of O
the O
programmes N
and O
in O
their O
practical O
implementation N
. O

For O
the O
time N
, O
the O
report N
grew O
too O
large O
when O
it O
was O
being O
debated O
. O

At O
this O
stage N
it O
is O
more O
important O
to O
concentrate O
on O
assessing O
how O
we H
can O
use H
this O
process N
to O
steer O
Union O
regional O
policy N
, O
bearing O
in O
mind N
that O
the O
aim N
is O
to O
reduce O
regional O
inequality N
. O

Our H
Group N
emphasises O
the O
importance N
of O
the O
principle N
of O
subsidiarity N
, O
the O
responsibility N
of O
Member N
States O
and O
the O
role N
of O
local O
players H
in O
drafting O
and O
implementing O
programmes N
. O

It O
is O
especially O
important O
to O
get O
SMEs O
involved O
in O
the O
planning O
and O
implementation N
of O
programmes N
. O

Our H
Group N
also O
considers O
it O
important O
to O
take O
greater O
account O
of O
remote O
and O
peripheral O
areas N
and O
wishes O
to O
increase O
interaction N
between O
towns N
and O
rural O
areas N
. O

Projects N
implemented O
with O
support N
from O
the O
Union O
have O
had O
their O
effect N
watered O
down O
all O
too O
often O
by O
slow O
decision N
making O
and O
complicated O
administrative O
processes N
. O

Funds N
have O
often O
been O
granted O
for O
projects N
which O
have O
had O
no O
lasting O
benefit N
for O
the O
area N
concerned O
. O

Projects N
have O
to O
be O
carried O
out H
more O
efficiently O
, O
more O
flexibly O
and O
they O
have O
to O
be O
made O
more O
productive O
. O

While O
the O
report N
was O
being O
prepared O
, O
it O
was O
interesting O
to O
discuss O
the O
Union O
's H
regional O
policy N
in O
general O
. O

For O
us H
new O
members H
, O
it O
was O
the O
first O
time N
, O
and O
this O
was O
a O
very O
interesting O
process N
. O

This O
report N
is O
very O
good O
and O
our H
Group N
supports O
it O
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
Commissioner H
, O
as O
proof N
that O
this O
Parliament N
has O
not O
yet O
overcome O
its O
role N
as O
a O
consultative O
and O
subordinate O
institution N
, O
the O
excellent O
report N
by O
a O
fellow H
member N
of O
my H
Group N
, O
Elisabeth H
Schroedter O
, O
has O
not O
been O
able O
to O
reach O
plenary O
sitting O
because O
the O
plans N
for O
regional O
development N
for O
the O
period N
2000 O
- O
2006 O
for O
Objective N
1 O
regions N
have O
been O
sitting O
in O
the O
Commission N
's H
offices N
for O
several O
months N
. O

Bearing O
this O
in O
mind N
, O
this O
House O
should O
, O
in O
any O
event N
, O
demand N
that O
, O
before O
the O
Community N
support N
frameworks N
for O
the O
period N
in O
question N
are O
approved O
, O
they O
be O
studied O
and O
submitted O
for O
debate N
in O
this O
Parliament N
, O
specifically O
in O
light N
of O
the O
guidelines N
that O
we H
have O
presented O
today N
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
we H
should O
not O
forget O
that O
the O
main O
, O
strategic O
objective N
of O
the O
Structural O
and O
Cohesion N
Funds N
and O
of O
their O
coordination N
is O
to O
achieve O
economic O
and O
social O
cohesion N
. O

We H
are O
obliged O
to O
participate O
in O
drafting O
Directives N
and O
also O
in O
assessing O
their O
results N
. O

We H
are O
obliged O
to O
do O
so O
because O
we H
are O
the O
representatives H
of O
the O
citizens H
in O
a O
Europe O
of O
Citizens H
and O
not O
just O
in O
a O
Europe O
of O
States O
and O
of O
Regions N
. O

We H
feel O
that O
the O
Funds N
are O
a O
necessary O
but O
insufficient O
condition N
for O
achieving O
economic O
and O
social O
cohesion N
. O

We H
might O
be O
mistaken O
in O
using O
the O
gross O
domestic O
product N
per O
inhabitant H
as O
the O
sole O
indicator N
. O

Some O
speakers H
have O
already O
mentioned O
unemployment N
and O
the O
fall N
in O
population N
. O

We H
will O
have O
to O
study O
several O
indicators N
, O
which O
will O
enable O
us H
to O
see O
the O
current O
state N
of O
regional O
societies N
that O
are O
in O
a O
worse O
situation N
than O
others O
, O
and O
how O
they O
are O
evolving O
. O

It O
is O
clear N
from O
some O
of O
the O
reports N
that O
have O
been O
presented O
to O
Parliament N
's H
plenary O
sitting O
today N
that O
Europe O
's H
25 O
most O
prosperous O
regions N
enjoy O
a O
level N
of O
unemployment N
which O
is O
five O
times N
lower O
than O
in O
the O
25 O
least O
prosperous O
regions N
. O

This O
fact N
means N
that O
the O
European O
Parliament N
, O
the O
Commissioner H
and O
the O
Commission N
must O
act N
decisively O
and O
strategically O
. O

I H
agree O
that O
the O
European O
Parliament N
did O
not O
have O
the O
opportunity N
- O
or O
that O
it O
was O
not O
given O
the O
opportunity N
, O
as O
we H
had O
reached O
the O
end N
of O
the O
parliamentary O
term N
- O
to O
discuss O
the O
Directives N
. O

I H
do O
not O
think O
, O
however O
, O
that O
this O
report N
has O
come O
too O
late O
. O

We H
all O
agree O
that O
we H
should O
ask O
that O
, O
halfway O
through O
these O
programmes N
, O
when O
the O
assessment N
of O
the O
Directives N
is O
made O
, O
Parliament N
should O
be O
given O
an O
equally O
influential O
role N
on O
the O
grounds N
that O
we H
are O
the O
citizens H
' O
representatives H
. O

Our H
citizens H
cannot O
can O
not O
accept O
that O
the O
European O
Union O
takes O
decisions N
in O
a O
way N
that O
is O
, O
at O
least O
on O
the O
face N
of O
it O
, O
bureaucratic O
. O

They O
need O
to O
see O
the O
political O
dimension N
working O
, O
to O
see O
that O
officials O
accept O
their O
responsibilities N
and O
that O
there O
is O
communication N
with O
the O
citizens H
. O

This O
is O
what O
we H
are O
today N
asking O
the O
Commissioner H
for O
. O

I H
would O
like O
to O
think O
that O
, O
given O
his O
previous O
experience N
as O
a O
regional O
President H
, O
he O
will O
agree O
to O
propose O
indicators N
, O
and O
a O
strategy N
, O
which O
will O
favour N
economic O
and O
social O
cohesion N
and O
not O
just O
productivity N
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
I H
support N
the O
main O
proposals N
of O
the O
report N
concerning O
the O
administration N
of O
the O
Structural O
Funds N
and O
the O
Cohesion N
Fund N
for O
the O
period N
2000 O
- O
2006 O
and O
the O
main O
recommendations N
of O
the O
report N
which O
include O
the O
following O
: O

Member N
States O
are O
urged O
to O
attach O
greater O
importance N
to O
integrated O
strategies N
for O
revitalising O
relations N
between O
towns N
and O
rural O
areas N
. O

This O
process N
will O
continue O
in O
accordance N
with O
the O
financial O
spending N
guidelines N
laid O
down O
by O
the O
EU O
leaders H
at O
their O
Berlin O
Summit N
last O
year N
, O
which O
were O
supported O
by O
Parliament N
at O
its O
last O
May O
plenary O
part N
- O
session N
. O

Key H
EU O
programmes N
between O
1989 O
, O
1993 O
, O
1994 O
and O
1999 O
have O
certainly O
helped O
to O
improve O
the O
economic O
competitiveness N
of O
peripheral O
countries N
and O
Objective N
1 O
regions N
within O
Europe O
. O

In O
conclusion N
, O
while O
key N
infrastructure N
projects N
have O
been O
supported O
by O
the O
European O
Regional O
Development N
Fund N
and O
the O
Cohesion N
Fund N
, O
we H
should O
remember O
that O
the O
European O
Social O
Fund N
has O
played O
a O
very O
important O
role N
in O
helping O
the O
less O
well-off O
in O
our H
society N
. O

The O
Social O
Fund N
has O
certainly O
improved O
our H
third O
- O
level N
institutions N
, O
financed O
our H
post N
- O
leaving O
certificate N
programmes N
and O
put O
in O
place N
comprehensive O
schemes N
to O
help O
combat O
youth H
and O
long-term O
unemployment N
, O
assist O
early O
school N
leavers H
and O
promote O
higher O
standards N
of O
adult O
literacy N
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
on O
numerous O
occasions N
in O
the O
past N
I H
have O
disagreed O
with O
the O
rapporteur H
on O
her O
approach N
to O
regional O
policy N
issues N
. O

The O
second N
point N
I H
would O
like O
to O
make O
is O
that O
we H
would O
have O
preferred O
it O
if O
the O
guidelines N
had O
been O
added O
to O
the O
Regulation N
in O
the O
form N
of O
an O
annex N
, O
as O
we H
and O
Mrs N
Mccarthy O
, O
as O
rapporteurs H
for O
the O
general O
Regulation N
, O
had O
asked O
. O

I H
am O
raising O
the O
issue N
just O
to O
reiterate O
Parliament N
's H
position N
. O

They O
are O
particularly O
beneficial O
to O
the O
Member N
States O
, O
and O
I H
would O
particularly O
like O
to O
draw O
your H
attention N
to O
the O
emphasis N
the O
Commission N
has O
placed O
on O
the O
issues N
of O
sustainable O
development N
, O
job N
creation N
and O
, O
more O
particularly O
, O
on O
equal O
opportunities N
and O
transport N
issues N
. O

Personally O
, O
I H
at O
least O
am O
totally O
in O
favour N
of O
the O
guidelines N
. O

As O
an O
islander H
, O
however O
, O
I H
would O
like O
to O
express O
my H
dissatisfaction N
at O
the O
lack N
of O
recognition N
of O
island N
development N
. O

This O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time N
that O
this O
issue N
has O
not O
been O
given O
the O
consideration N
it O
deserves O
. O

Commissioner H
, O
we H
shall O
continue O
to O
raise O
the O
issue N
, O
as O
Article N
158 O
, O
paragraph N
1 O
, O
of O
the O
Treaty N
of O
Amsterdam O
provides O
for O
an O
integrated O
policy N
for O
islands N
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
Commission N
should O
address N
the O
issue N
once O
and O
for O
all O
. O

As O
for O
us H
in O
Parliament N
, O
I H
would O
like O
to O
remind O
you H
of O
the O
code N
of O
conduct O
between O
the O
Commission N
and O
Parliament N
which O
was O
signed O
in O
May O
. O

I H
am O
absolutely O
certain O
that O
this O
code N
will O
be O
observed O
and O
that O
Parliament N
will O
keep O
abreast O
of O
all O
the O
developments N
and O
details N
concerning O
the O
implementation N
of O
the O
programmes N
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
Commissioner H
, O
in O
this O
minute O
and O
a O
half O
I H
should O
like O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
to O
congratulate O
Mrs N
Schroedter O
. O

I H
know O
many O
have O
already O
done O
so O
, O
but O
she O
has O
indeed O
earned O
our H
praise N
for O
being O
particularly O
open O
and O
attentive O
to O
proposals N
from O
all O
sides N
, O
and O
I H
think O
it O
is O
this O
openness N
which O
has O
given O
her O
report N
the O
quality N
we H
see O
today N
. O

I H
share O
the O
regrets N
she O
expressed O
, O
namely O
that O
Parliament N
has O
become O
involved O
rather O
late O
in O
the O
day N
as O
regards O
these O
guidelines N
, O
since O
by O
now O
the O
procedure N
for O
negotiations N
with O
the O
states N
is O
so O
far O
advanced O
that O
I H
cannot O
can O
not O
see O
this O
report N
having O
any O
sort N
of O
immediate O
effect N
, O
which O
in O
my H
view N
is O
a O
pity N
. O

In O
brief N
, O
I H
would O
like O
to O
say O
that O
we H
are O
entering O
the O
period N
when O
we H
are O
called O
upon O
to O
manage O
the O
programming N
for O
2000 O
- O
2006 O
, O
which O
must O
be O
no O
routine N
period N
for O
the O
good O
reason N
that O
we H
have O
two O
major O
challenges N
to O
face N
. O

The O
first O
is O
the O
harmonisation N
of O
national O
development N
policies N
and O
regional O
development N
policies N
. O

Subsidies N
are O
not O
enough O
to O
ensure O
development N
when O
infrastructure N
and O
public O
services N
are O
lacking O
. O

We H
must O
ask O
ourselves H
a O
fundamental O
question N
: O

The O
second N
challenge N
is O
that O
of O
enlargement N
which O
will O
, O
of O
course N
, O
have O
a O
considerable O
impact N
, O
both O
in O
budgetary O
and O
geographical O
terms N
. O

These O
are O
two O
areas N
of O
action N
which O
I H
invite O
the O
Commissioner H
to O
set O
up O
and O
in O
which O
I H
would O
ask O
him O
to O
involve O
us H
. O

Finally O
, O
in O
this O
time N
of O
natural O
disasters N
, O
I H
would O
just O
like O
to O
mention N
the O
issue N
of O
the O
use H
of O
Structural O
Funds N
. O

As O
you H
know O
, O
it O
is O
up O
to O
each O
State N
to O
redistribute O
part N
of O
the O
total N
appropriation N
. O

Europe O
should O
not O
be O
completely O
absent O
, O
as O
the O
states N
tend O
to O
want O
. O

Public O
opinion N
and O
the O
press N
nowadays O
accuse O
us H
of O
being O
unavailable O
to O
give O
a O
response N
, O
even O
though O
we H
are O
going O
to O
be O
funding N
a O
large O
proportion N
of O
the O
national O
operations N
. O

I H
think O
we H
should O
be O
capable O
of O
saying O
this O
loud O
and O
clear N
. O

I H
also O
think O
we H
should O
ensure O
, O
or O
ask O
Member N
States O
to O
ensure O
, O
that O
there O
is O
some O
publicity N
given O
to O
European O
aid N
whenever O
it O
is O
used O
to O
repair N
damage N
caused O
by O
natural O
disasters N
or O
accidents N
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
the O
priority N
given O
to O
financial O
and O
monetary O
criteria N
reinforces O
the O
increase O
in O
inequalities N
of O
every O
shape N
and O
form N
. O

Well O
, O
the O
Structural O
Funds N
have O
helped O
to O
apply O
a O
brake N
to O
this O
process N
. O

Our H
project N
of O
a O
Europe O
that O
aims O
to O
satisfy O
social O
needs N
envisages O
the O
convergence N
of O
living O
conditions N
towards O
the O
highest O
common O
denominator N
. O

What O
we H
are O
proposing O
specifically O
is O
a O
unified O
capital N
tax N
, O
which O
would O
make O
it O
possible O
to O
boost N
the O
funds N
used O
to O
support N
the O
harmonisation N
of O
social O
protection N
systems N
and O
the O
reduction N
of O
working O
hours N
at O
European O
level N
. O

The O
Commission N
, O
however O
, O
though O
bound O
to O
issue N
guidelines N
, O
does O
so O
only O
reluctantly O
and O
in O
a O
vague O
manner N
. O

The O
report N
put O
forward O
today N
re-establishes O
its O
place N
in O
the O
political O
sphere N
. O

This O
is O
what O
persuades O
us H
to O
vote N
in O
favour N
of O
it O
. O

Over O
the O
coming O
years N
, O
faced O
with O
the O
challenges N
of O
globalisation N
and O
eastward O
enlargement N
, O
Europe O
will O
, O
more O
than O
ever O
before O
, O
require O
appropriate O
detailed O
guidance N
on O
how O
to O
plan N
and O
revitalise O
its O
economy N
. O

To H
this O
end N
, O
Europe O
as O
a O
whole O
, O
and O
each O
Member N
State N
individually O
, O
will O
have O
to O
make O
optimum O
use H
of O
all O
available O
resources N
and O
capacities N
, O
including O
the O
Structural O
Funds N
. O

For O
this O
to O
be O
possible O
, O
what O
we H
need O
from O
the O
European O
Commission N
are O
not O
just O
good O
intentions N
, O
but O
clearer O
guidelines N
and O
a O
firm O
commitment N
to O
monitoring N
the O
way N
these O
resources N
are O
used O
by O
the O
Member N
States O
. O

For O
example N
, O
in O
recent O
years N
Italy O
has O
had O
problems N
in O
utilising O
the O
Structural O
Funds N
, O
mainly O
because O
of O
excessive O
bureaucracy N
, O
insufficient O
information N
and O
a O
lack N
of O
involvement N
of O
economic O
and O
social O
operators H
at O
local O
level N
. O

There O
are O
, O
therefore O
, O
two O
points O
to O
which O
I H
would O
like O
to O
draw O
the O
Commission N
's H
attention N
. O

Firstly O
, O
we H
need O
to O
make O
the O
best O
possible O
use H
of O
consultation N
as O
a O
means N
of O
ensuring O
proper O
coordination N
and O
participation N
by O
all O
local O
and O
regional O
operators H
in O
decision N
- O
making O
, O
precisely O
so O
that O
imbalances N
and O
inequalities N
can O
be O
avoided O
. O

Before O
you H
sign N
up O
. O

Does O
it O
cost O
money N
to O
use H
Facebook O
? O

Is O
it O
true O
that O
Facebook O
is O
going O
to O
charge O
to O
use H
the O
site N
? O

Facebook O
is O
a O
free O
site N
and O
will O
never O
require O
that O
you H
pay O
to O
continue O
using O
the O
site N
. O

You H
do O
, O
however O
, O
have O
the O
option N
of O
purchasing O
Facebook O
credits N
, O
which O
can O
be O
used O
to O
send O
gifts N
or O
to O
purchase N
items N
on O
applications N
or O
games N
. O

What O
is O
the O
minimum O
age N
required O
to O

for O
Facebook O
? O

In O

be O
eligible O
to O
sign N
up O

must O
be O
13 O
years N
of O
age N

older O

Can O
I H
create O
a O
joint O
Facebook O
account O
or O
share O
a O
Facebook O
account O
with O
someone H
else O
? O

Facebook O
accounts O
are O
for O
individual O
use H
. O

This O
means N
that O
we H
don't O
do O
not O
allow O
joint O
accounts O
. O

Additionally O
, O
you H
can O
only O
sign N
up O
for O
one N
Facebook O
account O
per O
email N
address N
. O

Since O
each O
account O
belongs O
to O
one N
person H
, O
we H
require O
everyone O
to O
use H
their O
real O
name N
on O
their O
account O
. O

This O
way N
, O
you H
always O
know O
who O
you H
're O

The O
evaluation N
report N
of O
the O
Pericles O
Programme N
was O
submitted O
on O
30 O
November O
2004 O
. O

Since O
early O
Summer N
2003 O
, O
the O
number N
of O
counterfeit N
euro N
banknotes N
detected O
in O
circulation N
has O
stabilised O
at O
about O
50000 O
a O
month N
, O
a O
level N
below O
the O
pre O
- O
euro N
levels N
, O
lower O
than O
the O
US O
dollar N
and O
extremely O
low O
compared O
to O
the O
nine O
billion O
genuine O
euro N
banknotes N
in O
circulation N
. O

At O
the O
same O
time N
, O
the O
number N
of O
counterfeit N
euro N
coins N
is O
continuing O
to O
increase O
but O
also O
remains O
low O
by O
historical O
standards N
. O

In O
addition N
, O
the O
police N
forces N
have O
successfully O
conducted O
a O
number N
of O
operations N
to O
dismantle O
workshops N
and O
seize O
large O
numbers N
of O
counterfeit N
banknotes N
and O
coins N
before O
they O
enter O
into O
circulation N
. O

This O
overall O
favourable O
situation N
is O
the O
result N
of O
a O
long O
preparation N
at O
both O
legislative O
and O
institutional O
level N
and O
demonstrates O
the O
high O
level N
of O
cooperation N
achieved O
in O
EU O
and O
at O
international O
level N
. O

The O
Commission N
set O
out H
the O
basic O
ideas N
for O
the O
protection N
of O
the O
euro N
in O
a O
Communication N
it O
published O
as O
early O
as O
1998 O
[ O

] O
. O

And O
, O
in O
1999 O
Europol O
’s H
mandate N
was O
extended O
to O
include O
money N
counterfeiting O
[ O

] O
. O

With O
regard N
to O
criminal O
sanctions N
, O
the O
Commission N
has O
published O
two O
reports N
[ O

] O
on O
the O
implementation N
of O
the O
above-mentioned O
Framework N
Decision O
, O
which O
show O
a O
satisfactory O
level N
of O
implementation N
. O

With O
a O
view N
to O
ensuring O
the O
clear N
structure N
in O
the O
fight N
against O
currency N
counterfeiting O
as O
well O
as O
close O
cooperation N
and O
efficient O

National O
Central O
Offices N
( O

, O
the O

- O
for O

, O
and O
the O

. O

The O
Pericles O
programme N
is O
playing O
a O
significant O
role N
in O
achieving O
the O
present N
results N
in O
the O
protection N
of O
the O
euro N
and O
the O
fight N
against O
the O
crime N
of O
counterfeiting O
, O
through O
the O

of O

and O
the O
development N
of O

. O

Continuing O
vigilance N
is O
needed O
in O

to O
maintain O
and O
build O
on O
the O
results N
currently O
achieved O
in O
the O
fight N
against O
euro N

. O

Training O
and O
technical O
assistance N
plays N
an O
important O
role N
in O
this O
respect N
, O
hence O
the O
need O
to O
continue O
the O
Pericles O
programme N
. O

In O
line N
with O
Article N
13 O
of O
the O
Pericles O
Decision O
, O
the O
evaluation N
of O
the O
Pericles O
programme N
was O
assigned O
to O
the O
independent O
auditor H
of O
the O
European O
Anti O
- O
Fraud N
Office O
( O
OLAF O
) O
who O
submitted O
the O
evaluation N
report N
on O
30 O
November O
2004 O
. O

The O
evaluator H
examined O
the O
files N
of O
21 O
of O
the O
Pericles O
actions N
carried O
out H
until O
March O
2004 O
, O
on O
Member N
State N
or O
Commission N
initiative N
. O

Based O
on O
questionnaires N
to O
organisers H
and O
participants H
, O
as O
well O
as O
discussions N
with O
stake N
holders H
, O
he O
reached O
the O
following O
main O
conclusions N
[ O
6 O
] O
: O

- O
The O
programme N
has O
improved O
awareness N
of O
the O
Community N
dimension N
of O
the O
euro N
and O
has O
also O
developed O
a O
greater O
understanding N
amongst O
the O
participants H
of O
the O
related O
laws N
and O
instruments N
and O
in O
particular O
of O
the O
relevant O
Community N
and O
broader O
European O
law N
. O

- O
With O
regard N
to O
the O
range N
of O
information N
exchanges N
and O
methodologies N
/ O
measures N
, O
most O
have O
been O
presented O
in O
the O
various O
workshops N
, O
meetings N
and O
seminars N
. O

- O
The O
target N
groups N
for O
the O
programme N
have O
been O
reached O
in O
part N
with O
a O
very O
high O
participation N
by O
law N
enforcement N
officials O
; O

attendance N
by O
commercial O
banking N
sector N
, O
specialist H
lawyers H
or O
chambers N
of O
commerce N
was O
not O
sufficient O
. O

- O
The O
activities N
examined O
were O
considered O
relevant O
to O
and O
among O
the O
main O
objectives N
of O
the O
programme N
. O

- O
In O
terms N
of O
costs O
, O
the O
evaluator H
found O
that O
some O
of O
the O
projects N
were O
particularly O
costly O
and O
highlighted O
specific O
cost O
items N
. O

The O
evaluator H
made O
the O
following O
main O
recommendations N
: O

A H
second N
evaluation N
should O
take O
place N
after O
four O
years N
. O

- O
The O
programme N
should O
continue O
to O
be O
available O
to O
all O
Member N
States O
but O
a O
priority N
should O
be O
given O
( O
in O
the O
first O
instance N
) O
to O
those O
with O
low O
participation N
or O
who O
did O
not O
organise O
actions N
in O
the O
first O
programme N
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
new O
Member N
States O
. O

- O
Emphasis O
should O
be O
put O
on O
practical O
training N
. O

There O
should O
be O
a O
prioritisation O
in O
favour N
of O
staff N
exchanges N
and O
specific O
training N
, O
including O
case N
studies N
. O

These O
activities N
are O
also O
more O
cost O
efficient O
. O

- O
Co-operation O
between O
the O
European O
institutions N
/ O
bodies N
( O
Commission N
/ O
OLAF O
, O
ECB O
and O
Europol O
) O
should O
be O
further O
developed O
so O
as O
to O
eliminate O
any O
overlapping N
between O
different O
programmes N
and O
to O
further O
improve O
the O
co-ordination O
of O
the O
main O
actors H
( O
law N
enforcement N
, O
banks N
, O
prosecutors H
) O
in O
the O
fight N
against O
euro N
counterfeiting O
. O

- O
With O
regard N
to O
the O
effect N
of O
the O
programme N
on O
the O
convergence N
of O
high O
level N
training N
for O
trainers H
, O
it O
was O
not O
possible O
to O
make O
an O
assessment N
as O
there O
was O
not O
sufficient O
information N
on O
the O
link N
between O
national O
strategies N
and O
the O
activities N
under O
Pericles O
. O

- O
With O
a O
view N
to O
enabling O
the O
assessment N
of O
the O
effect N
of O
the O
programme N
, O
among O
others O
on O
the O
convergence N
of O
high O
level N
training N
for O
trainers H
, O
the O
evaluator H
recommends O
the O
preparation N
of O
a O
strategy N
document N
, O
to O
be O
finalised O
before O
the O
new O
Pericles O
enters O
into O
effect N
. O

The O
implementation N
of O
the O
Programme N
made O
a O
slow O
start O
, O
mainly O
due O
to O
its O
adoption N
in O
December O
2001 O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
first O
project N
under O
Pericles O
was O
only O
carried O
out H
in O
October O
2002 O
and O
the O
amount N
committed O
in O
2002 O
was O
just O
under O
40 O
% O
of O
the O
initial O
budget N
allocation N
( O
the O
allocation N
was O
reviewed O
downwards O
in O
the O
course N
of O
the O
year N
) O
. O

Subsequently O
, O
the O
programme N
took O
off O
and O
the O
budget N
allocation N
was O
completely O
committed O
in O
2003 O
and O
2004 O
. O

Intentions N
for O
2005 O
show O
that O
the O
remaining O
amount N
will O
also O
be O
completely O
consumed O
. O

Based O
on O
these O
statistics N
/ O
forecasts N
, O
the O
overall O
level N
of O
commitments N
during O
the O
period N
2002 O
- O
2005 O
will O
reach O
80 O
% O
of O
the O
initial O
reference N
amount N
. O

The O
main O
aggregates N
in O
the O
implementation N
of O
Pericles O
are O
shown O
on O
Table N
2 O
. O

In O
the O
course N
of O
the O
first O
three O
years N
of O
the O
programme N
38 O
projects N
were O
initiated O
; O

for O
2005 O
another O
18 O
actions N
are O
intended O
by O
the O
Member N
States O
and O
the O
Commission N
. O

Of O
the O
total N
56 O
projects N
, O
41 O
originate O
at O
the O
competent O
authorities H
of O
Member N
States O
, O
while O
15 O
are O
an O
initiative N
of O
the O
Commission N
/ O
OLAF O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
actions N
carried O
out H
are O
conferences N
, O
seminars N
and O
workshops N
, O
as O
well O
as O
specialised O
training N
courses N
. O

Staff N
exchange O
has O
, O
nonetheless O
, O
gained O
ground N
and O
has O
now O
become O
a O
standard O
feature N
of O
Pericles O
. O

Following O
enlargement N
, O
this O
type N
of O
activity N
is O
likely O
to O
develop O
further O
, O
which O
is O
also O
in O
line N
with O
the O
recommendation N
of O
the O
Pericles O
evaluator H
. O

Only O
one N
technical O
study O
was O
undertaken O
under O
the O
current O
Pericles O
, O
which O
is O
planned O
to O
continue O
at O
a O
broader O
level N
in O
2005 O
. O

The O
analysis N
of O
Pericles O
by O
type N
of O
project N
is O
shown O
in O
Table N
3 O
. O

Almost O
2600 O
persons H
participated O
in O
these O
events N
. O

In O
earlier O
periods N
the O
large O
majority N
of O
participants H
were O
law N
enforcement N
agents H
, O
reflecting O
the O
priority N
to O
establish O
closer O
professional O
ties N
for O
a O
more O
efficient O
fight N
against O
euro N
counterfeiting O
. O

In O
that O
respect N
, O
the O
evaluation N
report N
( O
p. N
10 O
and O
11 O
) O
shows N
that O
, O
until O
March O
2004 O
, O
65 O
% O
of O
participants H
were O
mainly O
from O
law N
enforcement N
agencies N
. O

As O
of O
2003 O
, O
a O
greater O
involvement N
of O
judiciary N
authorities H
is O
observed O
, O
while O
as O
of O
2004 O
and O
2005 O
, O
there O
is O
a O
more O
pronounced O
participation N
of O
the O
financial O
sector N
( O
public O
sector N
financial O
intermediaries H
, O
National O
Central O
Banks N
, O
commercial O
banking N
and O
other O
financial O
institutions N
) O
. O

This O
development N
is O
in O
line N
with O
the O
recommendation N
of O
the O
evaluator H
, O
while O
the O
organisation N
of O
more O
technical O
seminars N
is O
also O
being O
promoted O
. O

In O
terms N
of O
origin N
of O
the O
participants H
, O
the O
evaluation N
report N
notes N
that O
these O
came O
from O
76 O
countries N
, O
with O
a O
majority N
from O
Member N
States O
. O

It O
was O
noted O
that O
some O
countries N
showed O
a O
low O
level N
of O
participation N
, O
among O
them O
some O
of O
the O
euro N
area N
countries N
. O

This O
situation N
may O
reflect O
organisational O
rather O
than O
structural O
situations N
and O
an O
effort N
to O
balance O
it O
is O
currently O
under O
way N
. O

Some O
countries N
are O
more O
active O
in O
organising O
events N
, O
with O
Italy O
representing O
over O
21 O
% O
of O
the O
total N
number N
of O
activities N
. O

As O
of O
2005 O
, O
the O
new O
Member N
States O
became O
active O
in O
organising O
Pericles O
actions N
. O

As O
the O
evaluation N
report N
also O
mentions O
( O
p. N
14 O
) O
that O
the O
organisation N
of O
Pericles O
actions N
covered O
all O
the O
areas N
relevant O
to O
the O
protection N
of O
the O
euro N
: O

law N
enforcement N
, O
judicial O
, O
financial O
and O
technical O
and O
promoted O
particularly O
the O
creation N
of O
networks N
useful O
for O
achieving O
greater O
efficiency N
in O
the O
fight N
against O
the O
crime N
of O
counterfeiting O
. O

Contributions N
at O
the O

that O

And O
it O
can O
be O
a O
very O
complicated O
thing N
, O
what O
human O
health N

. O

And O
those O
simple O
themes N
aren't O
are O
not O
really O
themes N
about O
the O
complex O
science N
of O
what O
's H
going O
on O
, O
but O
things N
that O
we H
all O
pretty O
well O
know O
. O

And O
I H
'm O
going O
to O
start O
with O
this O
one N
: O

We H
know O
that O
, O
right O
? O

We H
've O
experienced O
that O
. O

That O
's H
the O
theme N
of O
my H
talk O
. O

And O
we H
're O
making O
the O
ocean N
pretty O
unhappy O
in O
a O
lot N
of O
different O
ways N

This O
is O

shot N

Cannery O
Row O

Cannery O
Row O
, O
at O
the O
time N
, O
had O
the O
biggest O
industrial O
canning O
operation N
on O
the O
west O
coast N
. O

We H
piled O
enormous O
amounts N
of O
pollution N
into O
the O
air N
and O
into O
the O
water N
. O

Rolf H
Bolin O
, O
who O
was O
a O
professor H
at O
the O
Hopkin O
's H
Marine O
Station O
where O
I H
work N
, O
wrote O
in O
the O
1940s O
that O
" O
The O
fumes N
from O
the O
scum N
floating O
on O
the O
inlets N
of O
the O
bay N
were O
so O
bad O
they O
turned O
lead O
- O
based O
paints N
black O
" O
. O

They O
say O
, O
" O
You H
know O
what O
you H
smell O
? O
" O
. O

That O
pollution N
was O
money N
to O
that O
community N
, O
and O
those O
people N
dealt O
with O
the O
pollution N
and O
absorbed O
it O
into O
their O
skin N
and O
into O
their O
bodies N
because O
they O
needed O
the O
money N
. O

We H
made O
the O
ocean N
unhappy O
; O

we H
made O
people N
very O
unhappy O
, O
and O
we H
made O
them O
unhealthy O
. O

The O
pyramid N
of O
ocean N
life N
. O

We H
see O
the O
base N
of O
the O
food N
chain N
, O
the O
plankton A
, O
the O
small O
things N
, O
and O
we H
see O
how O
those O
animals A
are O
food N
to O
animals A
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
pyramid N
, O
and O
on O
so O
up O
this O
diagram N
. O

And O
that O
flow N
, O
that O
flow N
of O
life N
, O
from O
the O
very O
base N
up O
to O
the O
very O
top N
, O
is O
the O
flow N
that O
ecologists H
see O
. O

Now O
why O
does O
that O
matter N
for O
human O
health N
? O

Because O
when O
we H
jam N
things N
in O
the O
bottom N
of O
that O
pyramid N
that O
shouldn't O
should O
not O
be O
there O
, O
some O
very O
frightening O
things N
happen O
. O

Now O
, O
to O
bring O
that O
home N
, O
I H
thought O
I H
'd O
invent O
a O
little O
game N
. O

We H
don't O
do O
not O
really O
have O
to O
play O
it O
; O

It O
's H
the O
Styrofoam O
and O
chocolate N
game N
. O

Imagine O
that O
when O
we H
got O
on O
this O
boat N
, O
we H
were O
all O
given O
two O
Styrofoam O
peanuts N
. O

What O
'll O
happen O
is O
that O
the O
Styrofoam O
peanuts N
will O
start O
moving O
through O
our H
society N
here O
, O
and O
they O
will O
accumulate O
in O
the O
drunkest O
, O
stingiest O
people N
. O

There O
's H
no O
mechanism N
in O
this O
game N
for O
them O
to O
go O
anywhere O
but O
into O
a O
bigger O
and O
bigger O
pile N
of O
indigestible O
Styrofoam O
peanuts N
. O

And O
that O
's H
exactly O
what O
happens O
with O
PCBs O
in O
this O
food N
pyramid N
: O

They O
accumulate O
into O
the O
top N
of O
it O
. O

Now O
suppose O
, O
instead O
of O
Styrofoam O
peanuts N
, O
we H
take O
these O
lovely O
little O
chocolates N
that O
we H
get O
and O
we H
had O
those O
instead O
. O

PCBs O
accumulate O
. O

PCBs O
accumulate O
in O
dolphins A
in O
Sarasota O
Bay N
, O
in O
Texas H
, O
in O
North H
Carolina O
. O

They O
get O
into O
the O
food N
chain N
. O

The O
dolphins A
eat O
the O
fish A
that O
have O
PCBs O
from O
the O
plankton A
, O
and O
those O
PCBs O
, O
being O
fat-soluble O
, O
accumulate O
in O
these O
dolphins A
. O

Now O
, O
a O
dolphin A
, O
mother H
dolphin A
, O
any O
dolphin A
- O
there O
's H
only O
one N
way N
that O
a O
PCB O
can O
get O
out H
of O
a O
dolphin A
. O

In O
mother H
's H
milk N
. O

Here O
's H
a O
diagram N
of O
the O
PCB O
load N
of O
dolphins A
in O
Sarasota O
Bay N
. O

Females A
after O
their O
first O
calf A
is O
already O
weaned O
: O

Those O
females H
, O
they O
're O
not O
trying O
to O
. O

The O
death N
rate N
in O
these O
dolphins A
, O
for O
the O
first O
calf A
born O
of O
every O
female O
dolphin A
, O
is O
60 O
to O
80 O
percent N
. O

Now O
, O
the O
mother H
then O
can O
go O
and O
reproduce O
, O
but O
what O
a O
terrible O
price N
to O
pay O
for O
the O
accumulation N
of O
this O
pollutant N
in O
these O
animals A
- O
the O
death N
of O
the O
first O
- O
born O
calf A
. O

There O
's H
another O
top N
predator A
in O
the O
ocean N
, O
it O
turns N
out H
. O

And O
we H
also O
are O
eating O
meat N
that O
comes O
from O
some O
of O
these O
same O
places N
. O

This O
is O
whale A
meat N
that O
I H
photographed O
in O
a O
grocery N
store N
in O
Tokyo O
- O
or O
is O
it O
? O

In O
fact N
, O
what O
we H
did O
a O
few O
years N
ago O
was O
learn O
how O
to O
smuggle O
a O
molecular O
biology N
lab N
into O
Tokyo O
and O
use H
it O
to O
genetically O
test N
the O
DNA N
out H
of O
whale A
meat N
samples N
and O
identify O
what O
they O
really O
were O
. O

And O
some O
of O
those O
whale A
meat N
samples N
were O
whale A
meat N
. O

Some O
of O
them O
were O
illegal O
whale A
meat N
, O
by O
the O
way N
. O

That O
's H
another O
story N
. O

But O
some O
of O
them O
were O
not O
whale A
meat N
at O
all O
. O

Even O
though O
they O
were O
labeled O
whale A
meat N
, O
they O
were O
dolphin A
meat N
. O

Some O
of O
them O
were O
dolphin A
liver N
. O

And O
those O
dolphin A
parts N
had O
a O
huge O
load N
of O
PCBs O
, O
dioxins N
and O
heavy O
metals N
. O

And O
that O
huge O
load N
was O
passing O
into O
the O
people N
that O
ate O
this O
meat N
. O

It O
turns N
out H
that O
a O
lot N
of O
dolphins A
are O
being O
sold O
as O
meat N
in O
the O
whale A
meat N
market N
around O
the O
world N
. O

That O
's H
a O
tragedy N
for O
those O
populations N
, O
but O
it O
's H
also O
a O
tragedy N
for O
the O
people N
eating O
them O
because O
they O
don't O
do O
not O
know O
that O
that O
's H
toxic O
meat N
. O

We H
had O
these O
data N
a O
few O
years N
ago O
. O

It O
had O
two O
- O
three O
- O
to O
- O
400 O
times N
the O
toxic O
loads N
ever O
allowed O
by O
the O
EPA O
. O

And O
I H
remember O
there O
sitting O
at O
my H
desk N
thinking O
, O
" O
Well O
, O
I H
know O
this O
" O
. O

" O
This O
is O
a O
great O
scientific O
discovery N
" O
, O
but O
it O
was O
so O
awful O

PRINCETON O
– O
How O
quickly O
emerging O
markets N
' O
fortunes N
have O
turned O
. O

Not O
long O
ago O
, O
they O
were O
touted O
as O
the O
salvation N
of O
the O
world N
economy N
– O
the O
dynamic O
engines N
of O
growth N
that O
would O
take O
over O
as O
the O
economies N
of O
the O
United O
States O
and O
Europe O
sputtered O
. O

But O
now O
the O
emerging O
- O
market N
blues N
are O
back O
. O

The O
beating N
that O
these O
countries N
' O
currencies N
have O
taken O
as O
the O
US O
Federal O
Reserve N
begins O
to O
tighten O
monetary O
policy N
is O
just O
the O
start O
; O

everywhere O
one N
looks O
, O
it O
seems O
, O
there O
are O
deep-seated O
problems N
. O

Argentina O
and O
Venezuela O
have O
run O
out H
of O
heterodox O
policy N
tricks N
. O

Brazil O
and O
India O
need O
new O
growth N
models N
. O

Turkey O
and O
Thailand O
are O
mired O
in O
political O
crises N
that O
reflect O
long O
- O
simmering O
domestic O
conflicts N
. O

This O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time N
that O
developing O
countries N
have O
been O
hit O
hard O
by O
abrupt O
mood N
swings N
in O
global O
financial O
markets N
. O

The O
surprise O
is O
that O
we H
are O
surprised O
. O

Economists H
, O
in O
particular O
, O
should O
have O
learned O
a O
few O
fundamental O
lessons N
long O
ago O
. O

First O
, O
emerging O
- O
market N
hype N
is O
just O
that O
. O

Instead O
, O
emerging O
markets N
' O
growth N
over O
the O
last O
two O
decades N
was O
based O
on O
a O
fortuitous O
( O
and O
temporary O
) O
set O
of O
external O
circumstances N
: O

high O
commodity N
prices N
, O
low O
interest N
rates N
, O
and O
seemingly O
endless O
buckets N
of O
foreign O
finance O
. O

Governments N
that O
enjoyed O
the O
rollercoaster O
ride O
on O
the O
way N
up O
should O
not O
have O
been O
surprised O
by O
the O
plunge N
that O
inevitably O
follows O
. O

In O
theory N
, O
market N
- O
determined O
currency N
values N
are O
supposed O
to O
isolate O
the O
domestic O
economy N
from O
the O
vagaries N
of O
international O
finance O
, O
rising O
when O
money N
floods O
in O
and O
falling O
when O
the O
flows N
are O
reversed O
. O

In O
reality N
, O
few O
economies N
can O
bear O
the O
requisite O
currency N
alignments N
without O
pain N
. O

Floating O
exchange O
rates N
may O
moderate O
the O
adjustment N
difficulties N
, O
but O
they O
do O
not O
eliminate O
them O
. O

Fourth O
, O
faith N
in O
global O
economic O
- O
policy N
coordination N
is O
misplaced O
. O

America O
's H
fiscal O
and O
monetary O
policies N
, O
for O
example N
, O
will O
always O
be O
driven O
by O
domestic O
considerations N
first O
( O
if O
not O
second N
and O
third O
as O
well O
) O
. O

And O
European O
countries N
can O
barely O
look O
after O
their O
own O
common O
interests N
, O
let O
alone O
the O
world N
's H
. O

For O
the O
most O
part N
, O
that O
is O
not O
a O
bad O
thing N
. O

The O
Fed H
's H
huge O
monthly O
purchases N
of O
long-term O
assets N
– O
so-called O
quantitative O
easing O
– O
have O
benefited O
the O
world N
as O
a O
whole O
by O
propping O
up O
demand N
and O
economic O
activity N
in O
the O
US O
. O

Without O
QE O
, O
which O
the O
Fed H
is O
now O
gradually O
tapering N
, O
world N
trade N
would O
have O
taken O
a O
much O
bigger O
hit O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
rest N
of O
the O
world N
will O
benefit N
when O
Europeans H
are O
able O
to O
get O
their O
policies N
right O
and O
boost N
their O
economies N
. O

In O
the O
midst N
of O
a O
foreign O
- O
capital N
bonanza N
, O
stagnant O
levels N
of O
private O
investment N
in O
tradable O
goods N
are O
a O
particularly O
powerful O
danger N
signal N
that O
no O
amount N
of O
government N
mythmaking O
should O
be O
allowed O
to O
override O
. O

Officials H
face N
a O
simple O
choice N
: O

maintain O
strong O
prudential O
controls N
on O
capital N
flows N
, O
or O
be O
prepared O
to O
invest O
a O
large O
share O
of O
resources N
in O
self O
- O
insurance N
by O
accumulating O
large O
foreign O
reserves N
. O

The O
deeper O
problem N
lies N
with O
the O
excessive O
financialization O
of O
the O
global O
economy N
that O
has O
occurred O
since O
the O
1990 O
' O
s H
. O

The O
policy N
dilemmas N
that O
have O
resulted O
– O
rising O
inequality N
, O
greater O
volatility N
, O
reduced O
room N
to O
manage O
the O
real O
economy N
– O
will O
continue O
to O
preoccupy O
policymakers O
in O
the O
decades N
ahead O
. O

It O
is O
true O
, O
but O
unhelpful O
, O
to O
say O
that O
governments N
have O
only O
themselves O

WASHINGTON O
, O
DC O
– O
In O
his O
recent O
State N
of O
the O
Union O
address N
, O
US O
President H
Barack H
Obama H
reiterated O
his O
ambition N
to O
complete O
the O
Trans O
- O
Pacific O
Partnership N
, O
a O
proposed O
trade N
agreement N
among O
the O
US O
and O
11 O
Pacific O
countries N
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
European O
Union O
and O
China O
are O
pressing O
to O
close O
their O
own O
deals N
in O
Asia O
and O
elsewhere O
. O

Some O
activists H
and O
government N
officials O
get O
the O
relationship N
between O
strong O
IP O
protection N
and O
economic O
growth N
backwards O
, O
claiming O
that O
IP O
rights N
are O
an O
obstacle N
to O
development N
, O
and O
thus O
should O
not O
be O
enforced O
until O
after O
countries N
achieve O
high O
- O
income N
status N
. O

This O
attitude N
is O
particularly O
prevalent O
in O
India O
, O
which O
recently O
put O
trade N
negotiations N
with O
the O
EU O
on O
hold O
, O
and O
it O
was O
central O
to O
the O
failure N
of O
the O
Doha O
Round N
of O
global O
trade N
talks N
. O

As O
Indian O
Commerce N
Minister H
Anand H
Sharma H
put O
it O
, O
" O
inherent O
flexibilities N
must O
be O
provided O
to O
developing O
countries N
. O

Instead O
of O
diluting O
IP O
rights N
, O
developing O
countries N
like O
India O
should O
recognize O
that O
strengthening O
IP O
protection N
is O
a O
prerequisite N
for O
attracting O
the O
foreign O
investment N
that O
they O
need O
to O
help O
their O
economies N
grow O
, O
create O
jobs N
, O
and O
improve O
their O
citizens H
' O
capacity N
to O
consume O
. O

Today N
, O
IP O
accounts O
for O
much O
of O
the O
value N
at O
large O
companies N
. O

One O
study O
found O
that O
in O
2009 O
, O
across O
a O
variety N
of O
industries N
in O
the O
US O
, O
intellectual O
capital N
– O
patents N
, O
copyrights N
, O
databases N
, O
brands N
, O
and O
organizational O
knowledge N
– O
held O
a O
44 O
% O
share O
of O
firms N
' O
overall O
market N
value N
. O

Developing O
countries N
have O
a O
lot N
to O
gain O
from O
attracting O
multinational O
firms N
. O

They O
also O
spawn O
new O
local O
companies N
that O
serve O
as O
suppliers H
, O
thereby O
boosting O
employment N
, O
augmenting O
workers H
' O
skills N
, O
improving O
productivity N
, O
and O
increasing O
government N
revenue N
. O

According O
to O
a O
new O
study O
by O
the O
economists H
Robert H
Shapiro H
and O
Aparna O
Mathur O
, O
if O
India O
achieved O
Chinese O
levels N
of O
IP O
protection N
, O
its O
annual O
FDI O
inflows N
would O
increase O
by O
33 O
% O
annually O
. O

In O
the O
pharmaceutical O
sector N
– O
which O
is O
particularly O
vulnerable O
to O
IP O
infringement N
– O
a O
stronger O
IP O
regime N
could O
increase O
FDI O
inflows N
from O
$ O
1.5 O
billion O
this O
year N
to O
$ O
8.3 O
billion O
in O
2020 O
, O
with O
pharmaceutical O
R&D O
doubling O
to O
$ O
1.3 O
billion O
over O
the O
same O
period N
. O

The O
increased O
FDI O
would O
create O
18,000 O
new O
jobs N
in O
the O
pharmaceutical O
industry N
. O

If O
India O
could O
transform O
its O
IP O
regime N
to O
resemble O
the O
US O
system N
, O
which O
is O
more O
robust O
than O
China O
's H
, O
the O
benefits N
would O
be O
even O
greater O
. O

Inward O
FDI O
could O
increase O
by O
as O
much O
as O
83 O
% O
annually O
by O
2020 O
; O

in O
the O
pharmaceutical O
industry N
alone O
, O
FDI O
could O
reach O
as O
much O
as O
$ O
77 O
billion O
, O
with O
R&D O
rising O
to O
$ O
4.2 O
billion O
and O
44,000 O
new O
jobs N
being O
created O
. O

The O
Indian O
government N
's H
ongoing O
assault N
on O
pharmaceutical O
IP O
makes O
these O
findings N
even O
more O
significant O
. O

Over O
the O
last O
two O
years N
, O
India O
has O
invalidated O
or O
otherwise O
attacked O
patents N
on O
15 O
drugs N
produced O
by O
international O
firms N
in O
order O
to O
make O
way N
for O
local O
champions H
, O
claiming O
that O
exclusivity O
enables O
companies N
to O
charge O
high O
prices N
that O
harm O
consumers H
. O

But O
drug N
patents N
and O
prices N
are O
not O
the O
main O
– O
or O
even O
a O
major O
– O
obstacle N
to O
patients H
' O
access O
to O
medical O
care N
in O
India O
. O

The O
bigger O
issue N
, O
as O
the O
IMS O
consultancy N
found O
last O
year N
, O
is O
the O
shortage N
of O
doctors H
, O
clinics N
, O
and O
hospitals N
, O
especially O
in O
rural O
areas N
. O

Even O
the O
public O
clinics N
and O
hospitals N
that O
do O
exist O
are O
often O
rendered O
useless O
by O
high O
rates N
of O
absenteeism N
by O
doctors H
. O

Furthermore O
, O
Indians H
lack N
access O
to O
insurance N
programs N
, O
particularly O
for O
outpatient H
care N
. O

This O
, O
coupled O
with O
the O
lack N
of O
a O
public O
safety N
net O
, O
makes O
health N
problems N
a O
leading N
source N
of O
economic O
hardship N
, O
even O
for O
middle-class O
families N
. O

Far O
from O
improving O
citizens H
' O
access O
to O
health N
care N
, O
weak O
IP O
protections N
are O
exacerbating O
India O
's H
formidable O
health N
- O
care N
challenges N
. O

It O
is O
equally O
important O
for O
trade N
negotiators H
worldwide O
to O
reject O
the O
notion N
that O
IP O
protection N
is O
a O
luxury O
that O
only O
rich O
countries N
can O
afford O
. O

The O
reality N
is O
that O
IP O
protection N
is O
an O
economic O
engine N
that O
developing O
- O
country N
citizens H
should O
not O
have O
to O
forego O
. O

The O
Banks N
that O
Ate O
the O
Economy N
. O

LONDON O
– O
Bank N
of O
England O
Governor H
Mark H
Carney O
surprised O
his O
audience N
at O
a O
conference N
late O
last O
year N
by O
speculating O
that O
banking N
assets N
in O
London O
could O
grow O
to O
more O
than O
nine O
times N
Britain O
's H
GDP O
by O
2050 O
. O

His O
forecast N
represented O
a O
simple O
extrapolation N
of O
two O
trends N
: O

continued O
financial O
deepening N
worldwide O
( O
that O
is O
, O
faster O
growth N
of O
financial O
assets N
than O
of O
the O
real O
economy N
) O
, O
and O
London O
's H
maintenance N
of O
its O
share O
of O
the O
global O
financial O
business N
. O

These O
may O
be O
reasonable O
assumptions N
, O
but O
the O
estimate N
was O
deeply O
unsettling O
to O
many O
. O

Hosting O
a O
huge O
financial O
center N
, O
with O
outsize N
domestic O
banks N
, O
can O
be O
costly O
to O
taxpayers H
. O

In O
Iceland O
and O
Ireland O
, O
banks N
outgrew O
their O
governments N
' O
ability N
to O
support N
them O
when O
needed O
. O

The O
result N
was O
disastrous O
. O

Quite O
apart O
from O
the O
potential N
bailout O
costs O
, O
some O
argue O
that O
financial O
hypertrophy N
harms O
the O
real O
economy N
by O
syphoning O
off O
talent N
and O
resources N
that O
could O
better O
be O
deployed O
elsewhere O
. O

But O
Carney O
argues O
that O
, O
on O
the O
contrary N
, O
the O
rest N
of O
the O
British O
economy N
benefits N
from O
having O
a O
global O
financial O
center N
in O
its O
midst N
. O

" O
Being O
at O
the O
heart N
of O
the O
global O
financial O
system N
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
broadens O
the O
investment N
opportunities N
for O
the O
institutions N
that O
look O
after O
British O
savings N
, O
and O
reinforces O
the O
ability N
of O
UK O
manufacturing N
and O
creative O
industries N
to O
compete O
globally O
. O

" O
That O
is O
certainly O
the O
assumption N
on O
which O
the O
London O
market N
has O
been O
built O
and O
the O
line N
that O
successive O
governments N
have O
peddled O
. O

But O
it O
is O
coming O
under O
fire N
. O

" O
He O
argues O
( O
in O
a O
speech N
revealingly O
entitled O
" O
The O
Contribution N
of O
the O
Financial O
Sector N
: O
Miracle O
or O
Mirage O
? O
" O
) O
that O
the O
financial O
sector N
's H
reported O
contribution N
to O
GDP O
has O
been O
significantly O
overrated O
. O

Two O
recent O
papers N
raise O
further O
doubts N
. O

In O
" O
The O
Growth N
of O
Modern O
Finance N
" O
, O
Robin H
Greenwood H
and O
David H
Scharfstein O
of O
Harvard O
Business N
School N
show O
that O
the O
share O
of O
finance O
in O
US O
GDP O
almost O
doubled O
between O
1980 O
and O
2006 O
, O
just O
before O
the O
onset N
of O
the O
financial O
crisis N
, O
from O
4.9 O
% O
to O
8.3 O
% O
. O

The O
two O
main O
factors N
driving O
that O
increase O
were O
the O
expansion N
of O
credit N
and O
the O
rapid O
rise N
in O
resources N
devoted O
to O
asset N
management N
( O
associated O
, O
not O
coincidentally O
, O
with O
the O
exponential O
growth N
in O
financial O
- O
sector N
incomes N
) O
. O

Greenwood H
and O
Scharfstein O
argue O
that O
increased O
financialization O
was O
a O
mixed O
blessing N
. O

There O
may O
have O
been O
more O
savings N
opportunities N
for O
households N
and O
more O
diverse O
funding N
sources N
for O
firms N
, O
but O
the O
added O
value N
of O
asset N
- O
management N
activity N
was O
illusory O
. O

Much O
of O
it O
involved O
costly O
churning O
of O
portfolios N
, O
while O
increased O
leverage N
implied O
fragility N
for O
the O
financial O
system N
as O
a O
whole O
and O
imposed O
severe O
social O
costs O
as O
over O
- O
exposed O
households N
subsequently O
went O
bankrupt O
. O

Stephen H
G. O
Cecchetti O
and O
Enisse O
Kharroubi O
of O
the O
Bank N
for O
International O
Settlements N
– O
the O
central O
banks N
' O
central O
bank N
– O
go O
further O
. O

They O
argue O
that O
rapid O
financial O
- O
sector N
growth N
reduces O
productivity N
growth N
in O
other O
sectors N
. O

Using O
a O
sample N
of O
20 O
developed O
countries N
, O
they O
find O
a O
negative O
correlation N
between O
the O
financial O
sector N
's H
share O
of O
GDP O
and O
the O
health N
of O
the O
real O
economy N
. O

But O
it O
is O
clear N
that O
financial O
firms N
compete O
with O
others O
for O
resources N
, O
and O
especially O
for O
skilled O
labor N
. O

Physicists H
or O
engineers H
with O
doctorates N
can O
choose O
to O
develop O
complex O
mathematical O
models N
of O
market N
movements N
for O
investment N
banks N
or O
hedge N
funds N
, O
where O
they O
are O
known O
colloquially O
as O
" O
rocket N
scientists H
. O

" O
Or H
they O
could O
use H
their O
talents N
to O
design N
, O
say O
, O
real O
rockets N
. O

Cecchetti O
and O
Kharroubi O
find O
evidence N
that O
it O
is O
indeed O
research N
- O
intensive O
firms N
that O
suffer O
most O
when O
finance O
is O
booming O
. O

And O
we H
are O
not O
just O
talking O
about O
the O
so-called O
" O
quants O
. O

" O
In O
the O
years N
before O
the O
2008 O
financial O
crisis N
, O
more O
than O
a O
third O
of O
Harvard O
MBAs O
, O
and O
a O
similar O
proportion N
of O
graduates H
of O
the O
London O
School N
of O
Economics N
, O
went O
to O
work N
for O
financial O
firms N
. O

( O
Some O
might O
cynically O
say O
that O
keeping N
MBAs O
and O
economists H
out H
of O
real O
businesses N
is O
a O
blessing N
, O
but O
I H
doubt O
that O
that O
is O
really O
true O
. O
) O

The O
authors H
find O
another O
intriguing O
effect N
, O
too O
. O

Periods N
of O
rapid O
growth N
in O
lending N
are O
often O
associated O
with O
construction N
booms N
, O
partly O
because O
real O
- O
estate N
assets N
are O
relatively O
easy O
to O
post N
as O
collateral O
for O
loans N
. O

But O
the O
rate N
of O
productivity N
growth N
in O
construction N
is O
low O
, O
and O
the O
value N
of O
many O
credit N
- O
fueled O
projects N
subsequently O
turns N
out H
to O
be O
low O
or O
negative O
. O

So O
, O
should O
Britons O
look O
forward O
with O
enthusiasm N
to O
the O
future N
sketched O
by O
Carney O
? O

Aspiring O
derivatives N
traders H
certainly O
will O
be O
more O
confident O
of O
their O
career N
prospects N
. O

And O
other O
parts N
of O
the O
economy N
that O
provide O
services N
to O
the O
financial O
sector N
– O
Porsche O
dealers N
and O
strip N
clubs N
, O
for O
example N
– O
will O
be O
similarly O
encouraged O
. O

Sustaining O
Ukraine O
's H
Breakthrough N
. O

NEW O
YORK O
– O
Following O
a O
crescendo N
of O
terrifying O
violence N
, O
the O
Ukrainian O
uprising N
has O
had O
a O
surprisingly O
positive N
outcome N
. O

Contrary O
to O
all O
rational O
expectations N
, O
a O
group N
of O
citizens H
armed O
with O
not O
much O
more O
than O
sticks N
and O
shields N
made O
of O
cardboard O
boxes N
and O
metal O
garbage N
- O
can O
lids N
overwhelmed O
a O
police N
force N
firing O
live O
ammunition N
. O

There O
were O
many O
casualties H
, O
but O
the O
citizens H
prevailed O
. O

This O
was O
one N
of O
those O
historic O
moments N
that O
leave O
a O
lasting O
imprint N
on O
a O
society N
's H
collective O
memory N
. O

How O
could O
such O
a O
thing N
happen O
? O

Quantum N
mechanics N
offers O
a O
fitting O
metaphor N
. O

similarly O
, O
human O
beings A
may O
behave O
both O
as O
individual O
particles N
and O
as O
components N
of O
a O
larger O
wave N
. O

In O
other O
words N
, O
the O
unpredictability N
of O
historical O
events N
like O
those O
in O
Ukraine O
has O
to O
do O
with O
an O
element N
of O
uncertainty N
in O
human O
identity N
. O

People N
's H
identity N
is O
made O
up O
of O
individual O
elements N
and O
elements N
of O
larger O
units N
to O
which O
they O
belong O
, O
and O
peoples N
' O
impact N
on O
reality N
depends O
on O
which O
elements N
dominate O
their O
behavior N
. O

When O
civilians H
launched O
a O
suicidal O
attack N
on O
an O
armed O
force N
in O
Kyiv O
on O
February O
20 O
, O
their O
sense N
of O
representing O
" O
the O
nation N
" O
far O
outweighed O
their O
concern N
with O
their O
individual O
mortality N
. O

The O
result N
was O
to O
swing O
a O
deeply O
divided O
society N
from O
the O
verge N
of O
civil O
war N
to O
an O
unprecedented O
sense N
of O
unity N
. O

Whether O
that O
unity N
endures O
will O
depend O
on O
how O
Europe O
responds O
. O

Ukrainians N
have O
demonstrated O
their O
allegiance N
to O
a O
European O
Union O
that O
is O
itself O
hopelessly O
divided O
, O
with O
the O
euro N
crisis N
pitting O
creditor H
and O
debtor H
countries N
against O
one N
another O
. O

That O
is O
why O
the O
EU O
was O
hopelessly O
outmaneuvered O
by O
Russia O
in O
the O
negotiations N
with O
Ukraine O
over O
an O
Association N
Agreement N
. O

True O
to O
form N
, O
the O
EU O
under O
German O
leadership N
offered O
far O
too O
little O
and O
demanded O
far O
too O
much O
from O
Ukraine O
. O

Now O
, O
after O
the O
Ukrainian O
people N
's H
commitment N
to O
closer O
ties N
with O
Europe O
fueled O
a O
successful O
popular O
insurrection N
, O
the O
EU O
, O
along O
with O
the O
International O
Monetary O
Fund N
, O
is O
putting O
together O
a O
multibillion O
- O
dollar N
rescue N
package N
to O
save O
the O
country N
from O
financial O
collapse N
. O

But O
that O
will O
not O
be O
sufficient O
to O
sustain O
the O
national O
unity N
that O
Ukraine O
will O
need O
in O
the O
coming O
years N
. O

I H
established O
the O
Renaissance O
Foundation N
in O
Ukraine O
in O
1990 O
– O
before O
the O
country N
achieved O
independence N
. O

The O
foundation N
did O
not O
participate O
in O
the O
recent O
uprising N
, O
but O
it O
did O
serve O
as O
a O
defender H
of O
those O
targeted O
by O
official O
repression N
. O

The O
foundation N
is O
now O
ready O
to O
support N
Ukrainians N
' O
strongly O
felt N
desire N
to O
establish O
resilient O
democratic O
institutions N
( O
above O
all O
, O
an O

But O
Ukraine O
will O
need O

assistance N
that O
only O
the O
EU O
can O
provide O
: O

management N
expertise N
and O
access O
to O
markets N
. O

In O
the O
remarkable O
transformation N
of O
Central O
Europe O
's H
economies N
in O
the O
1990 O
' O
s H
, O
management N
expertise N
and O
market N
access O
resulted O
from O
massive O
investments N
by O
German O
and O
other O
EU O
- O
based O
companies N
, O
which O
integrated O
local O
producers H
into O
their O
global O
value N
chains N
. O

Ukraine O
, O
with O
its O
high O
- O
quality N
human O
capital N
and O
diversified O
economy N
, O
is O
a O
potentially O
attractive O
investment N
destination N
. O

But O
realizing O
this O
potential N
requires O
improving O
the O
business N
climate N
across O
the O
economy N
as O
a O
whole O
and O
within O
individual O
sectors N
– O
particularly O
by O
addressing O
the O
endemic O
corruption N
and O
weak O
rule N
of O
law N
that O
are O
deterring O
foreign O
and O
domestic O
investors H
alike O
. O

In O
addition N
to O
encouraging O
foreign O
direct O
investment N
, O
the O
EU O
could O
provide O
support N
to O
train N
local O
companies N
' O
managers H
and O
help O
them O
develop O
their O
business N
strategies N
, O
with O
service N
providers H
remunerated O
by O
equity N
stakes N
or O
profit N
- O
sharing N
. O

An O
effective O
way N
to O
roll O
out H
such O
support N
to O
a O
large O
number N
of O
companies N
would O
be O
to O
combine O
it O
with O
credit N
lines N
provided O
by O
commercial O
banks N
. O

To H
encourage O
participation N
, O
the O
European O
Bank N
for O
Reconstruction N
and O
Development N
( O
EBRD O
) O
could O
invest O
in O
companies N
alongside O
foreign O
and O
local O
investors H
, O
as O
it O
did O
in O
Central O
Europe O
. O

Ukraine O
would O
thus O
open O
its O
domestic O
market N
to O
goods N
manufactured O
or O
assembled O
by O
European O
companies N
' O
wholly O
- O
or O
partly O
- O
owned O
subsidiaries N
, O
while O
the O
EU O
would O
increase O
market N
access O
for O
Ukrainian O
companies N
and O
help O
them O
integrate O
into O
global O
markets N
. O

I H
hope O
and O
trust N
that O
Europe O
under O
German O
leadership N
will O
rise N
to O
the O
occasion N
. O

I H
have O
been O
arguing O
for O
several O
years N
that O
Germany H
should O
accept O
the O
responsibilities N
and O
liabilities N
of O
its O
dominant O
position N
in O
Europe O
. O

Today N
, O
Ukraine O
needs N
a O
modern-day O
equivalent N
of O
the O
Marshall H
Plan N
, O
by O
which O
the O
United O
States O
helped O
to O
reconstruct O
Europe O
after O
World N
War N
II O
. O

Germany H
ought O
to O
play O
the O
same O
role N
today N
as O
the O
US O
did O
then O
. O

I H
must O
, O
however O
, O
end N
with O
a O
word N
of O
caution N
. O

The O
Marshall H
Plan N
did O
not O
include O
the O
Soviet O
bloc N
, O
thereby O
reinforcing O
the O
Cold O
War N
division N
of O
Europe O
. O

A H
replay N
of O
the O
Cold O
War N
would O
cause N
immense O
damage N
to O
both O
Russia O
and O
Europe O
, O
and O
most O
of O
all O
to O
Ukraine O
, O
which O
is O
situated O
between O
them O
. O

Ukraine O
depends O
on O
Russian O
gas N
, O
and O
it O
needs N
access O
to O
European O
markets N
for O
its O
products N
; O

it O
must O
have O
good O
relations N
with O
both O
sides N
. O

Chancellor H
Angela H
Merkel O
must O
reach O
out H
to O
President H
Vladimir H
Putin H
to O
ensure O
that O
Russia O
is O
a O
partner H
, O
not O
an O
opponent H
, O
in O
the O
Ukrainian O
renaissance N

China O
's H
Growth N
Puzzle N
. O

Perceptions N
of O
resilience N
have O
given O
way N
to O
fears N
of O
vulnerability N
. O

The O
US O
Federal O
Reserve N
's H
tapering N
of O
its O
unprecedented O
liquidity N
injections N
has O
been O
an O
obvious O
and O
important O
trigger N
. O

Emerging O
economies N
that O
are O
overly O
dependent O
on O
global O
capital N
flows N
– O
particularly O
India O
, O
Indonesia O
, O
Brazil O
, O
South O
Africa O
, O
and O
Turkey O
– O
are O
finding O
it O
tougher O
to O
finance O
economic O
growth N
. O

In O
the O
throes N
of O
crisis N
, O
generalization N
is O
the O
norm N
; O

in O
the O
end N
, O
however O
, O
it O
pays O
to O
differentiate O
. O

Unlike O
the O
deficit N
- O
prone O
emerging O
economies N
that O
are O
now O
in O
trouble N
– O
whose O
imbalances N
are O
strikingly O
reminiscent O
of O
those O
in O
the O
Asian O
economies N
that O
were O
hit O
by O
the O
late-1990 O
' O
s H
financial O
crisis N
– O
China O
runs O
a O
current O
- O
account O
surplus O
. O

As O
a O
result N
, O
there O
is O
no O
risk N
of O
portfolio N
outflows N
resulting O
from O
the O
Fed H
's H
tapering N
of O
its O
monthly O
asset N
purchases N
. O

And O
, O
of O
course N
, O
China O
's H
outsize N
backstop N
of O
$ O
3.8 O
trillion N
in O
foreign O
- O
exchange O
reserves N
provides O
ample O
insurance N
in O
the O
event N
of O
intensified O
financial O
contagion N
. O

It O
is O
neither O
desirable O
nor O
feasible O
for O
China O
to O
return O
to O
the O
trajectory N
of O
10 O
% O
annual O
growth N
that O
it O
achieved O
in O
the O
three O
decades N
after O
1980 O
. O

Yet O
a O
superficial O
fixation N
on O
China O
's H
headline N
GDP O
growth N
persists O
, O
so O
that O
a O
25 O
% O
deceleration N
, O
to O
a O
7 O
- O
8 O
% O
annual O
rate N
, O
is O
perceived O
as O
somehow O
heralding O
the O
end N
of O
the O
modern O
world N
's H
greatest O
development N
story N
. O

This O
knee N
- O
jerk N
reaction N
presumes O
that O
China O
's H
current O
slowdown N
is O
but O
a O
prelude N
to O
more O
growth N
disappointments N
to O
come O
– O
a O
presumption N
that O
reflects O
widespread O
and O
longstanding O
fears N
of O
a O
broad O
array N
of O
disaster N
scenarios N
, O
ranging O
from O
social O
unrest N
and O
environmental O
catastrophes N
to O
housing N
bubbles N
and O
shadow N
- O
banking N
blow-ups O
. O

While O
these O
concerns O
should O
not O
be O
dismissed O
out H
of O
hand N
, O
none N
of O
them O
is O
the O
source N
of O
the O
current O
slowdown N
. O

Instead O
, O
lower O
growth N
rates N
are O
the O
natural O
result N
of O
the O
long O
- O
awaited O
rebalancing O
of O
the O
Chinese O
economy N
. O

In O
other O
words N
, O
what O
we H
are O
witnessing O
is O
the O
effect N
of O
a O
major O
shift N
from O
hyper O
- O
growth N
led O
by O
exports N
and O
investment N
( O
thanks N
to O
a O
vibrant O
manufacturing N
sector N
) O
to O
a O
model N
that O
is O
much O
more O
reliant O
on O
the O
slower O
but O
steadier O
growth N
dynamic O
of O
consumer H
spending N
and O
services N
. O

Indeed O
, O
in O
2013 O
, O
the O
Chinese O
services N
sector N
became O
the O
economy N
's H
largest O
, O
surpassing O
the O
combined O
share O
of O
the O
manufacturing N
and O
construction N
sectors N
. O

The O
codependency O
construct O
is O
rooted O
in O
the O
psychopathology N
of O
human O
relationships N
whereby O
two O
partners H
, O
whether O
out H
of O
need O
or O
convenience N
, O
draw O
unhealthy O
support N
from O
each O
other O
. O

Ultimately O
, O
codependency O
leads O
to O
a O
loss N
of O
identity N
, O
serious O
frictions N
, O
and O
often O
a O
nasty O
breakup N
– O
unless O
one N
or O
both O
of O
the O
partners H
becomes O
more O
self-reliant O
and O
strikes O
out H
on O
his O
or O
her O
own O
. O

The O
economic O
analogue N
of O
codependency O
applies O
especially O
well O
to O
the O
US O
and O
China O
. O

China O
's H
export N
- O
led O
growth N
miracle N
would O
not O
have O
started O
in O
the O
1980 O
' O
s H
without O
the O
American O
consumer H
. O

The O
US O
, O
for O
its O
part N
, O
relied O
on O
cheap O
goods N
made O
in O
China O
to O
stretch O
hard-pressed O
consumers H
' O
purchasing O
power N
. O

It O
also O
became O
dependent O
on O
China O
's H
savings N
surplus O
to O
finance O
its O
own O
savings N
shortfall N
( O
the O
world N
's H
largest O
) O
, O
and O
took O
advantage N
of O
China O
's H
voracious O
demand N
for O
US O
Treasury O
securities N
to O
help O
fund O
massive O
budget N
deficits N
and O
subsidize O
low O
domestic O
interest N
rates N
. O

Frictions N
between O
the O
two O
partners H
have O
developed O
over O
a O
wide O
range N
of O
issues N
, O
including O
trade N
, O
the O
renminbi O
's H
exchange O
rate N
, O
regional O
security N
, O
intellectual O
property N
, O
and O
cyber O
attacks N
, O
among O
others O
. O

And O
, O
just O
as O
a O
psychologist H
would O
predict O
, O
one N
of O
the O
partners H
, O
China O
, O
has O
decided O
to O
go O
its O
own O
way N
. O

China O
's H
rebalancing O
will O
enable O
it O
to O
absorb O
its O
surplus O
savings N
, O
which O
will O
be O
put O
to O
work N
building N
a O
social O
safety N
net O
and O
boosting O
Chinese O
households N
' O
wherewithal N
. O

As O
a O
result N
, O
China O
will O
no O
longer O
be O
inclined O
to O
lend O
its O
capital N
to O
the O
US O
. O

For O
a O
growth N
- O
starved O
US O
economy N
, O
the O
transformation N
of O
its O
codependent O
partner H
could O
well O
be O
a O
fork N
in O
the O
road N
. O

One O
path N
is O
quite O
risky O
: O

The O
other O
path N
holds O
great O
opportunity N
: O

In O
doing O
so O
, O
the O
US O
could O
draw O
support N
from O
exports N
, O
especially O
to O
a O
rebalanced O
China O
– O
currently O
its O
third O
- O
largest O
and O
fastest O
- O
growing O
major O
export N
market N
. O

Compared O
with O
other O
emerging O
economies N
, O
China O
is O
cut O
from O
a O
different O
cloth N
. O

China O
emerged O
from O
the O
late-1990 O
' O
s H
Asian O
financial O
crisis N
as O
the O
region N
's H
most O
resilient O
economy N
, O
and O
I H
suspect O
the O
same O
will O
be O
true O
this O
time N
. O

Malthus O

CAMBRIDGE O
– O
The O
promise N
that O
each O
generation N
will O
be O
better O
off O
than O
the O
last O
is O
a O
fundamental O
tenet N
of O
modern O
society N
. O

By O
and O
large O
, O
most O
advanced O
economies N
have O
fulfilled O
this O
promise N
, O
with O
living O
standards N
rising O
over O
recent O
generations A
, O
despite O
setbacks N
from O
wars N
and O
financial O
crises N
. O

In O
the O
developing O
world N
, O
too O
, O
the O
vast O
majority N
of O
people N
have O
started O
to O
experience N
sustained O
improvement N
in O
living O
standards N
and O
are O
rapidly O
developing O
similar O
growth N
expectations N
. O

But O
will O
future N
generations A
, O
particularly O
in O
advanced O
economies N
, O
realize O
such O
expectations N
? O

So O
far O
, O
every O
prediction N
in O
the O
modern O
era N
that O
mankind N
's H
lot N
will O
worsen O
, O
from O
Thomas H
Malthus O
to O
Karl H
Marx H
, O
has O
turned O
out H
to O
be O
spectacularly O
wrong O
. O

Technological O
progress N
has O
trumped O
obstacles N
to O
economic O
growth N
. O

Periodic O
political O
rebalancing O
, O
sometimes O
peaceful O
, O
sometimes O
not O
, O
has O
ensured O
that O
the O
vast O
majority N
of O
people N
have O
benefited O
, O
albeit O
some O
far O
more O
than O
others O
. O

As O
a O
result N
, O
Malthus O
's H
concerns O
about O
mass O
starvation N
have O
failed O
to O
materialize O
in O
any O
peaceful O
capitalist O
economy N
. O

And O
, O
despite O
a O
disconcerting O
fall N
in O
labor N
's H
share O
of O
income N
in O
recent O
decades N
, O
the O
long-run O
picture N
still O
defies O
Marx H
's H
prediction N
that O
capitalism N
would O
prove O
immiserating O
for O
workers H
. O

Living O
standards N
around O
the O
world N
continue O
to O
rise N
. O

But O
past N
growth N
performance N
is O
no O
guarantee N
that O
a O
broadly O
similar O
trajectory N
can O
be O
maintained O
throughout O
this O
century N
. O

Leaving O
aside O
potential N
geopolitical O
disruptions N
, O
there O
are O
some O
formidable O
challenges N
to O
overcome O
, O
mostly O
stemming O
from O
political O
underperformance O
and O
dysfunction N
. O

The O
first O
set O
of O
issues N
includes O
slow O
- O
burn O
problems N
involving O
externalities N
, O
the O
leading N
example N
being O
environmental O
degradation N
. O

When O
property N
rights N
are O
ill-defined O
, O
as O
in O
the O
case N
of O
air N
and O
water N
, O
government N
must O
step O
in O
to O
provide O
appropriate O
Regulation N
. O

I H
do O
not O
envy O
future N
generations A
for O
having O
to O
address N
the O
possible O
ramifications N
of O
global O
warming O
and O
fresh O
- O
water N
depletion N
. O

A H
second N
set O
of O
problems N
concerns O
the O
need O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
economic O
system N
is O
perceived O
as O
fundamentally O
fair O
, O
which O
is O
the O
key N
to O
its O
political O
sustainability N
. O

Inequality N
can O
corrupt O
and O
paralyze O
a O
country N
's H
political O
system N
– O
and O
economic O
growth N
along O
with O
it O
. O

The O
third O
problem N
is O
that O
of O
aging N
populations N
, O
an O
issue N
that O
would O
pose O
tough O
challenges N
even O
for O
the O
best O
- O
designed O
political O
system N
. O

Soaring O
public O
debts N
surely O
exacerbate O
the O
problem N
, O
because O
future N
generations A
are O
being O
asked O
both O
to O
service N
our H
debt N
and O
to O
pay O
for O
our H
retirements N
. O

The O
final O
challenge N
concerns O
a O
wide O
array N
of O
issues N
that O
require O
Regulation N
of O
rapidly O
evolving O
technologies N
by O
governments N
that O
do O
not O
necessarily O
have O
the O
competence N
or O
resources N
to O
do O
so O
effectively O
. O

We H
have O
already O
seen O
where O
poor O
Regulation N
of O
rapidly O
evolving O
financial O
markets N
can O
lead O
. O

There O
are O
parallel O
shortcomings N
in O
many O
other O
markets N
. O

A H
leading N
example N
is O
food N
supply N
– O
an O
area N
where O
technology N
has O
continually O
produced O
ever O
- O
more O
highly O
processed O
and O
genetically O
refined O
food N
that O
scientists H
are O
only O
beginning O
to O
assess O
. O

What O
is O
known O
so O
far O
is O
that O
childhood N
obesity N
has O
become O
an O
epidemic N
in O
many O
countries N
, O
with O
an O
alarming O
rise N
in O
rates N
of O
type N
2 O
diabetes N
and O
coronary O
disease N
implying O
a O
significant O
negative O
impact N
on O
life N
expectancy N
in O
future N
generations A
. O

Many O
leading N
health N
researchers H
, O
including O
Kelly H
Brownell O
, O
David H
Ludwig H
, O
and O
Walter H
Willett O
, O
have O
documented O
these O
problems N
. O

Government O
interventions N
to O
date N
, O
mainly O
in O
the O
form N
of O
enhanced O
education N
, O
have O
proved O
largely O
ineffective O
. O

Self-destructive O
addiction N
to O
processed O
foods N
, O
which O
economists H
would O
describe O
as O
an O
" O
internality N
" O
, O
can O
lower O
quality N
of O
life N
for O
those O
afflicted O
, O
and O
can O
eventually O
lead O
to O
externalities N
for O
society N
, O
such O
as O
higher O
health N
- O
care N
costs O
. O

Again O
, O
despite O
a O
rising O
chorus N
of O
concern N
from O
researchers H
, O
political O
markets N
have O
seemed O
frozen O
. O

Addressing O
inequality N
requires O
greater O
redistribution N
through O
national O
tax N
systems N
, O
together O
with O
enhanced O
programs N
for O
adult O
education N
, O
presumably O
making O
heavy O
use H
of O
new O
technologies N
. O

The O
negative O
effects N
of O
falling O
population N
growth N
can O
be O
mitigated O
by O
easing O
restrictions N
on O
international O
migration N
, O
and O
by O
encouraging O
more O
women H
and O
retirees H
to O
enter O
or O
stay O
in O
the O
workforce N
. O

But O
how O
long O
it O
will O
take O
for O
governments N
to O
act N
is O
a O
wide-open O
question N
. O

Capitalist O
economies N
have O
been O
spectacularly O
efficient O
at O
enabling O
growing O
consumption N
of O
private O
goods N
, O
at O
least O
over O
the O
long O
run O
. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
public O
goods N
– O
such O
as O
education N
, O
the O
environment N
, O
health N
care N
, O
and O
equal O
opportunity N
– O
the O
record N
is O
not O
quite O
as O
impressive O
, O
and O
the O
political O
obstacles N
to O
improvement N
have O
seemed O
to O
grow O
as O
capitalist O
economies N
have O
matured O
. O

Will H
each O
future N
generation N
continue O
to O
enjoy O
a O
better O
quality N
of O
life N
than O
its O
immediate O
predecessor H
? O

In O
developing O
countries N
that O
have O
not O
yet O
reached O
the O
technological O
frontier N
, O
the O
answer N
is O
almost O
certainly O
yes O
. O

The O
Innovation N
Enigma N
. O

NEW O
YORK O
– O
Around O
the O
world N
, O
there O
is O
enormous O
enthusiasm N
for O
the O
type N
of O
technological O
innovation N
symbolized O
by O
Silicon O
Valley N
. O

In O
this O
view N
, O
America O
's H
ingenuity N
represents O
its O
true O
comparative O
advantage N
, O
which O
others O
strive O
to O
imitate O
. O

But O
there O
is O
a O
puzzle N
: O

it O
is O
difficult O
to O
detect O
the O
benefits N
of O
this O
innovation N
in O
GDP O
statistics N
. O

What O
is O
happening O
today N
is O
analogous O
to O
developments N
a O
few O
decades N
ago O
, O
early O
in O
the O
era N
of O
personal O
computers N
. O

In O
1987 O
, O
economist H
Robert H
Solow O
– O
awarded O
the O
Nobel O
Prize N
for O
his O
pioneering O
work N
on O
growth N
– O
lamented O
that O
" O
You H
can O
see O
the O
computer N
age N
everywhere O
but O
in O
the O
productivity N
statistics N
. O

" O
There O
are O
several O
possible O
explanations N
for O
this O
. O

Perhaps O
GDP O
does O
not O
really O
capture O
the O
improvements N
in O
living O
standards N
that O
computer N
- O
age N
innovation N
is O
engendering O
. O

As O
it O
turns N
out H
, O
there O
is O
some O
truth N
in O
both O
perspectives N
. O

Recall O
how O
a O
few O
years N
ago O
, O
just O
before O
the O
collapse N
of O
Lehman O
Brothers O
, O
the O
financial O
sector N
prided O
itself O
on O
its O
innovativeness N
. O

Given O
that O
financial O
institutions N
had O
been O
attracting O
the O
best O
and O
brightest O
from O
around O
the O
world N
, O
one N
would O
have O
expected O
nothing N
less O
. O

But O
, O
upon O
closer O
inspection N
, O
it O
became O
clear N
that O
most O
of O
this O
innovation N
involved O
devising O
better O
ways N
of O
scamming O
others O
, O
manipulating O
markets N
without O
getting O
caught O
( O
at O
least O
for O
a O
long O
time N
) O
, O
and O
exploiting O
market N
power N
. O

In O
this O
period N
, O
when O
resources N
flowed O
to O
this O
" O
innovative O
" O
sector N
, O
GDP O
growth N
was O
markedly O
lower O
than O
it O
was O
before O
. O

Even O
in O
the O
best O
of O
times N
, O
it O
did O
not O
lead O
to O
an O
increase O
in O
living O
standards N
( O
except O
for O
the O
bankers H
) O
, O
and O
it O
eventually O
led O
to O
the O
crisis N
from O
which O
we H
are O
only O
now O
recovering O
. O

The O
net O
social O
contribution N
of O
all O
of O
this O
" O
innovation N
" O
was O
negative O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
dot-com O
bubble N
that O
preceded O
this O
period N
was O
marked O
by O
innovation N
– O
Web N
sites N
through O
which O
one N
could O
order O
dog A
food N
and O
soft O
drinks N
online O
. O

At O
least O
this O
era N
left O
a O
legacy N
of O
efficient O
search N
engines N
and O
a O
fiber-optic O
infrastructure N
. O

But O
it O
is O
not O
an O
easy O
matter N
to O
assess O
how O
the O
time N
savings N
implied O
by O
online O
shopping O
, O
or O
the O
cost O
savings N
that O
might O
result N
from O
increased O
competition N
( O
owing O
to O
greater O
ease N
of O
price N
comparison N
online O
) O
, O
affects O
our H
standard O
of O
living O
. O

Two O
things N
should O
be O
clear N
. O

First O
, O
the O
profitability N
of O
an O
innovation N
may O
not O
be O
a O
good O
measure N
of O
its O
net O
contribution N
to O
our H
standard O
of O
living O
. O

In O
our H
winner H
- O
takes O
- O
all O
economy N
, O
an O
innovator H
who O
develops O
a O
better O
Web N
site N
for O
online O
dog A
- O
food N
purchases N
and O
deliveries N
may O
attract O
everyone O
around O
the O
world N
who O
uses O
the O
Internet N
to O
order O
dog A
food N
, O
making O
enormous O
profits N
in O
the O
process N
. O

But O
without O
the O
delivery N
service N
, O
much O
of O
those O
profits N
simply O
would O
have O
gone O
to O
others O
. O

The O
Web N
site N
's H
net O
contribution N
to O
economic O
growth N
may O
in O
fact N
be O
relatively O
small O
. O

Moreover O
, O
if O
an O
innovation N
, O
such O
as O
ATMs N
in O
banking N
, O
leads O
to O
increased O
unemployment N
, O
none N
of O
the O
social O
cost O
– O
neither O
the O
suffering N
of O
those O
who O
are O
laid O
off O
nor O
the O
increased O
fiscal O
cost O
of O
paying O
them O
unemployment N
benefits N
– O
is O
reflected O
in O
firms N
' O
profitability N
. O

Likewise O
, O
our H
GDP O
metric N
does O
not O
reflect O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
increased O
insecurity N
individuals H
may O
feel O
with O
the O
increased O
risk N
of O
a O
loss N
of O
a O
job N
. O

Equally O
important O
, O
it O
often O
does O
not O
accurately O
reflect O
the O
improvement N
in O
societal O
wellbeing N
resulting O
from O
innovation N
. O

In O
a O
simpler O
world N
, O
where O
innovation N
simply O
meant O
lowering O
the O
cost O
of O
production N
of O
, O
say O
, O
an O
automobile N
, O
it O
was O
easy O
to O
assess O
an O
innovation N
's H
value N
. O

And O
this O
is O
even O
more O
apparent O
in O
other O
arenas N
: O

How O
do O
we H
accurately O
assess O
the O
fact N
that O
, O
owing O
to O
medical O
progress N
, O
heart N
surgery N
is O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
successful O
now O
than O
in O
the O
past N
, O
leading N
to O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O
life N
expectancy N
and O
quality N
of O
life N
? O

Still O
, O
one N
cannot O
can O
not O
avoid O
the O
uneasy O
feeling O
that O
, O
when O
all O
is O
said O
and O
done O
, O
the O
contribution N
of O
recent O
technological O
innovations N
to O
long-term O
growth N
in O
living O
standards N
may O
be O
substantially O
less O
than O
the O
enthusiasts H
claim O
. O

A H
lot N
of O
intellectual O
effort N
has O
been O
devoted O
to O
devising O
better O
ways N
of O
maximizing O
advertising N
and O
marketing N
budgets N
– O
targeting O
customers H
, O
especially O
the O
affluent O
, O
who O
might O
actually O
buy O
the O
product N
. O

But O
standards N
of O
living O
might O
have O
been O
raised O
even O
more O
if O
all O
of O
this O
innovative O
talent N
had O
been O
allocated O
to O
more O
fundamental O
research N
– O
or O
even O
to O
more O
applied O
research N
that O
could O
have O
led O
to O
new O
products N
. O

Yes O
, O
being O
better O
connected O
with O
each O
other O
, O
through O
Facebook O
or O
Twitter H
, O
is O
valuable O
. O

But O
how O
can O
we H
compare O
these O
innovations N
with O
those O
like O
the O
laser N
, O
the O
transistor N
, O
the O
Turing O
machine N
, O
and O
the O
mapping N
of O
the O
human O
genome N
, O
each O
of O
which O
has O
led O
to O
a O
flood N
of O
transformative O
products N
? O

Of O
course N
, O
there O
are O
grounds N
for O
a O
sigh N
of O
relief N
. O

Although O
we H
may O
not O
know O
how O
much O
recent O
technological O
innovations N
are O
contributing O
to O
our H
wellbeing N
, O
at O
least O
we H
know O
that O
, O
unlike O
the O
wave N
of O
financial O
innovations N
that O
marked O
the O
pre O
- O
crisis N
global O
economy N
, O
the O
effect N
is O
positive N
. O

The O
Maternal O
Thread N
of O
Life N
. O

ISLAMABAD O
– O
Last O
month N
, O
Oxford O
University N
's H
Green H
Templeton O
College N
held O
its O
annual O
Emerging O
Markets N
Symposium N
at O
Egrove O
Park H
. O

The O
theme N
this O
year N
was O
" O
Maternal O
and O
Child H
Health N
and O
Nutrition N
. O
" O

The O
final O
slide N
of O
the O
opening N
presentation N
, O
delivered O
by O
GTC O
fellow H
Stephen H
Kennedy H
, O
was O
a O
cartoon N
depicting O
two O
young O
contestants H
set O
to O
begin O
a O
race N
: O

one N
was O
strong O
and O
healthy O
, O
while O
the O
other O
was O
emaciated O
, O
shackled O
, O
carrying O
the O
baggage N
of O
disease N
, O
and O
confronting O
the O
massive O
barrier N
of O
malnutrition N
. O

The O
message N
was O
clear N
: O

not O
everyone O
begins O
life N
with O
the O
same O
chance N
of O
success N
. O

Of O
course N
, O
this O
is O
not O
a O
groundbreaking O
insight N
. O

The O
impact N
of O
factors N
like O
poverty N
, O
maternal O
literacy N
, O
sanitation N
, O
and O
housing N
conditions N
on O
children H
's H
health N
– O
and O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
on O
social O
and O
economic O
outcomes N
– O
is O
well O
documented O
. O

The O
problem N
is O
that O
these O
factors N
are O
not O
amenable O
to O
isolated O
public O
- O
health N
interventions N
. O

But O
another O
, O
less O
widely O
discussed O
social O
determinant N
– O
maternal O
nutrition N
– O
could O
be O
. O

Since O
Hippocrates O
, O
people N
have O
been O
discussing O
how O
" O
nature N
" O
and O
" O
nurture N
" O
interact O
to O
shape N
a O
person H
's H
development N
. O

Indeed O
, O
even O
in O
ancient O
civilizations N
, O
adequate O
maternal O
nutrition N
was O
considered O
essential O
to O
ensuring O
future N
generations A
' O
survival N
and O
prosperity N
. O

But O
poverty N
and O
ignorance N
can O
thwart O
even O
the O
best O
intentions N
. O

The O
consequences N
of O
maternal O
malnutrition N
are O
far O
- O
reaching O
, O
including O
higher O
child H
- O
mortality N
rates N
, O
more O
birth N
defects N
, O
increased O
susceptibility N
to O
infection N
, O
and O
specific O
nutritional O
deficiencies N
that O
can O
lock O
a O
child H
into O
a O
vicious O
cycle N
of O
poor O
health N
early O
in O
life N
. O

Moreover O
, O
intrauterine O
malnutrition N
can O
increase O
the O
risk N
of O
chronic O
conditions N
like O
obesity N
, O
diabetes N
, O
and O
cardiovascular O
disease N
during O
adulthood N
. O

They O
were O
surprised O
by O
evidence N
that O
babies H
grow O
in O
the O
same O
way N
worldwide O
, O
as O
long O
as O
they O
receive O
the O
same O
care N
and O
are O
not O
constrained O
by O
environmental O
factors N
– O
evidence N
that O
challenged O
the O
widely O
held O
notion N
that O
ethnicity N
and O
gender N
are O
major O
determinants N
of O
a O
child H
's H
development N
. O

In O
fact N
, O
upon O
hearing O
the O
evidence N
, O
a O
former O
Pakistani O
prime O
minister H
confessed O
that O
he O
would O
have O
been O
more O
proactive O
in O
this O
area N
had O
he O
known O
while O
he O
was O
in O
office N
what O
he O
knows O
now O
. O

The O
meeting N
's H
participants H
agreed O
that O
strong O
efforts N
to O
support N
pre O
- O
conception N
care N
in O
the O
context N
of O
maternal O
- O
and O
child H
- O
health N
services N
were O
vital O
. O

After O
all O
, O
if O
an O
adequately O
nourished O
mother H
provides O
critical O
health N
benefits N
to O
her O
offspring H
throughout O
their O
lives O
, O
women H
can O
be O
viewed O
as O
the O
custodians H
of O
future N
generations A
' O
health N
. O

These O
inter O
- O
generational O
biological O
connections N
are O
particularly O
pronounced O
in O
the O
case N
of O
female O
children H
. O

The O
influence N
of O
the O
levels N
and O
composition N
of O
maternal O
nutrition N
on O
a O
female O
fetus A
will O
carry O
through O
to O
adulthood N
, O
when O
she O
, O
too O
, O
becomes O
a O
mother H
. O

Given O
how O
few O
scientists H
have O
recognized O
the O
extent N
to O
which O
a O
woman H
's H
eggs N
shape N
her O
grandchildren H
's H
prospects N
, O
it O
is O
not O
surprising O
that O
policymakers O
remain O
so O
oblivious O
to O
the O
long-term O
impact N
of O
women H
's H
health N
. O

But O
the O
evidence N
is O
clear N
, O
and O
it O
demands O
action N
. O

The O
good O
news N
is O
that O
there O
are O
solutions N
. O

Conditional O
cash N
transfers N
, O
text N
- O
message N
- O
based O
initiatives N
, O
school N
- O
based O
food N
programs N
, O
vitamin N
- O
fortification N
schemes N
, O
and O
local O
leadership N
have O
all O
proved O
effective O
in O
improving O
maternal O
nutrition N
. O

Such O
initiatives N
should O
be O
backed O
by O
policies N
that O
foster O
positive N
nutritional O
choices N
. O

Compelling O
policymakers O
to O
implement O
such O
policies N
will O
require O
a O
new O
set O
of O
skills N
that O
draws O
upon O
lessons N
from O
around O
the O
world N
. O

In O
Brazil O
, O
a O
television N
program N
on O
the O
role N
that O
folic O
- O
acid O
supplementation N
could O
play O
in O
the O
prevention N
of O
spina O
bifida O
( O
a O
congenital O
neural O
tube N
defect N
) O
immediately O
grabbed O
politicians H
' O
attention N
. O

Initiatives N
aimed O
at O
enhancing O
the O
public O
's H
knowledge N
of O
nutrition N
are O
also O
crucial O
– O
not O
least O
because O
they O
can O
motivate O
citizens H
to O
pressure O
their O
governments N
to O
take O
action N
. O

To H
this O
end N
, O
entertainment N
media N
like O
soap N
operas N
, O
which O
have O
emerged O
as O
important O
tools N
for O
empowering O
women H
in O
conservative O
Middle O
Eastern O
societies N
, O
could O
be O
employed O
. O

Forums N
like O
the O
Emerging O
Market N
Symposium N
can O
help O
to O
bridge N
the O
increasingly O
obvious O
gap N
between O
science N
and O
public O
policy N
. O

But O
, O
without O
strong O
domestic O
support N
for O
change O
, O
the O
impact N
of O
such O
meetings N
is O
limited O
. O

It O
is O
time N
to O
demand N
action N
– O
and O
past N
time N
for O
policymakers O
to O
deliver O

South O
Korea O
's H
Feminine O
Future N
. O

Over O
the O
last O
half O
- O
century N
, O
South O
Korea O
has O
made O
considerable O
economic O
progress N
, O
with O
per O
capita O
income N
increasing O
from O
a O
mere O
$ O
80 O
dollars N
in O
1960 O
to O
more O
than O
$ O
22,000 O
last O
year N
. O

But O
its O
potential N
for O
sustained O
growth N
is O
faltering O
, O
owing O
to O
the O
imminent O
decline N
of O
its O
working O
- O
age N
population N
– O
projected O
to O
fall N
by O
25 O
% O
by O
2050 O
– O
and O
rising O
competition N
from O
China O
and O
other O
emerging O
economies N
. O

In O
order O
to O
improve O
its O
prospects N
, O
South O
Korea O
must O
pursue O
economic O
reform N
and O
restructuring O
, O
with O
an O
emphasis N
on O
maximizing O
its O
human O
- O
capital N
resources N
– O
especially O
women H
. O

South O
Korea O
's H
success N
over O
the O
last O
five O
decades N
owes O
much O
to O
the O
rapid O
growth N
of O
its O
well O
- O
educated O
labor N
force N
. O

From O
1960 O
to O
2010 O
, O
the O
share O
of O
adults H
with O
a O
secondary O
education N
soared O
from O
20 O
% O
to O
an O
impressive O
87 O
% O
. O

By O
boosting O
productivity N
, O
increasing O
returns O
on O
investment N
, O
and O
facilitating O
technological O
adaption N
and O
innovation N
, O
South O
Korea O
's H
abundance N
of O
well O
- O
educated O
workers H
has O
served O
as O
the O
foundation N
for O
its O
export N
- O
oriented O
development N
strategy N
. O

But O
women H
remain O
underutilized O
, O
to O
the O
detriment N
of O
the O
entire O

Indeed O
, O
any O
effective O
South O

must O
create O
more O
and O
better O
economic O
opportunities N
for O
women H
, O
in O
part N
by O
establishing O
more O
accommodating O
working O
environments N
and O
instituting O
a O
more O
diverse O
and O
flexible O
education N
system N
. O

To H
its O
credit N
, O
South O
Korea O
has O
built O
a O
relatively O
gender N
- O
equal O
society N
. O

The O
country N
elected O
its O
first O
female O
President H
, O
Park H
Geun O
- O
hye O
, O
in O
2012 O
. O

But O
a O
significant O
gender N
gap N
remains O
in O
terms N
of O
the O
return O
on O
human O
capital N
. O

According O
to O
OECD O
data N
, O
only O
55 O
% O
of O
South O
Korean O
women H
aged O
15 O
- O
64 O
are O
in O
the O
labor N
force N
, O
compared O
to O
an O
average O
of O
65 O
% O
in O
the O
advanced O
economies N
. O

South O
Korea O
's H
male O
labor N
- O
force N
participation N
rate N
, O
by O
contrast N
, O
stands O
at O
about O
77 O
% O
– O
close O
to O
the O
OECD O
average O
of O
79 O
% O
. O

The O
labor N
- O
participation N
rate N
for O
women H
with O
post N
- O
secondary O
education N
is O
64 O
% O
, O
far O
exceeding O
the O
35 O
% O
rate N
for O
those O
with O
only O
a O
primary O
or O
middle O
- O
school N
education N
. O

But O
, O
even O
for O
South O
Korea O
's H
most O
highly O
educated O
and O
capable O
female O
workers H
, O
child H
rearing N
is O
a O
major O
career N
obstacle N
. O

In O
fact N
, O
South O
Korean O
women H
participate O
in O
the O
labor N
force N
at O
roughly O
the O
average O
rate N
for O
the O
OECD O
while O
they O
are O
in O
their O
late O
twenties N
. O

The O
problem N
is O
that O
the O
rate N
drops O
sharply O
from O
71 O
% O
to O
57 O
% O
among O
women H
in O
their O
30 O
' O
s H
, O
as O
inflexible O
working O
environments N
and O
a O
lack N
of O
affordable O
childcare N
undermine O
their O
ability N
to O
continue O
investing O
in O
their O
careers N
. O

The O
good O
news N
is O
that O
Park H
's H
government N
is O
working O
to O
change O
this O
. O

But O
it O
is O
less O
clear N
how O
the O
government N
will O
create O
additional O
jobs N
for O
women H
. O

It O
could O
, O
for O
example N
, O
split O
full-time O
jobs N
into O
multiple O
part-time O
positions N
, O
and O
offer O
incentives N
for O
workers H
to O
reduce O
their O
hours N
. O

But O
, O
given O
that O
South O
Korea O
's H
workforce N
already O
includes O
a O
substantial O
share O
of O
non O
- O
regular O
workers H
, O
increasing O
temporary O
employment N
may O
not O
contribute O
to O
economic O
growth N
. O

A H
better O
approach N
would O
entail O
creating O
high O
- O
quality N
jobs N
in O
modern O
service N
industries N
. O

As O
it O
stands O
, O
while O
the O
services N
sector N
accounts O
for O
more O
than O
70 O
% O
of O
employment N
in O
South O
Korea O
, O
its O
productivity N
- O
growth N
rate N
remains O
much O
lower O
than O
that O
of O
the O
manufacturing N
sector N
. O

Too O
many O
people N
are O
working O
in O
traditional O
, O
low O
- O
productivity N
service N
industries N
, O
such O
as O
wholesale N
, O
retail N
trade N
, O
and O
restaurants N
, O
leaving O
modern O
, O
high O
- O
productivity N
services N
like O
communications N
, O
health N
, O
financial O
intermediation N
, O
and O
business N
services N
underdeveloped O
. O

It O
is O
also O
important O
to O
narrow O
the O
mismatch N
between O
women H
's H
abilities N
and O
their O
career N
paths N
. O

The O
current O
system N
tends O
to O
reinforce O
gender N
roles N
, O
encouraging O
children H
to O
follow O
culturally O
framed O
paths N
, O
instead O
of O
nurturing O
their O
individual O
interests N
and O
potential N
. O

For O
example N
, O
female O
university N
students H
are O
much O
more O
likely O
to O
study O
humanities N
than O
the O
so-called O
" O
STEM N
" O
subjects N
( O
science N
, O
technology N
, O
engineering N
, O
and O
mathematics N
) O
– O
key N
drivers N
of O
productivity N
gains N
, O
innovation N
, O
and O
economic O
growth N
. O

Efforts N
by O
primary O
and O
secondary O
schools N
could O
help O
to O
foster O
more O
diverse O
interests N
among O
female O
students H
, O
giving O
talented O
young O
women H
the O
tools N
they O
need O
to O
make O
important O
contributions N
to O
key N
economic O
sectors N
. O

Of O
course N
, O
the O
potential N
of O
educated O
, O
empowered O
women H
to O
drive O
sustained O
economic O
growth N
is O
not O
limited O
to O
South O
Korea O
. O

Japanese O
Prime O
Minister H
Shinzo O
Abe H
, O
too O
, O
has O
identified O
increased O
female O
labor N
- O
force N
participation N
as O
critical O
to O
efforts N
to O
revive O
his O
country N
's H
long O
- O
dormant O
economy N
. O

Closing O
Africa O
's H
Agricultural O
Gender N
Gap N
. O

SEATTLE O
– O
Africa O
's H
GDP O
is O
now O
growing O
faster O
than O
any O
other O
continent N
's H
. O

When O
many O
people N
think O
about O
the O
engines N
driving O
that O
growth N
, O
they O
imagine O
commodities N
like O
oil N
, O
gold N
, O
and O
cocoa N
, O
or O
maybe O
industries N
like O
banking N
and O
telecommunications N
. O

I H
think O
of O
a O
woman H
named O
Joyce H
Sandir O
. O

Joyce H
is O
a O
farmer H
who O
grows O
bananas A
, O
vegetables N
, O
and O
maize A
on O
a O
small O
plot N
of O
land O
in O
rural O
Tanzania O
. O

When O
I H
met O
her O
in O
2012 O
, O
she O
had O
just O
harvested O
her O
first O
crop N
of O
maize A
grown O
from O
a O
seed N
specifically O
adapted O
for O
Tanzania O
's H
climate N
. O

As O
Joyce H
's H
story N
demonstrates O
, O
agriculture N
is O
crucial O
to O
Africa O
's H
future N
. O

Research O
shows N
that O
increasing O
agricultural O
productivity N
is O
the O
most O
effective O
way N
to O
reduce O
poverty N
in O
sub-Saharan O
Africa O
. O

In O
fact N
, O
agriculture N
offers O
the O
continent N
its O
best O
opportunity N
to O
turn O
a O
vicious O
cycle N
of O
poverty N
into O
a O
virtuous O
cycle N
of O
development N
. O

That O
is O
why O
leaders H
and O
policymakers O
from O
across O
the O
continent N
have O
declared O
2014 O
Africa O
's H
Year O
of O
Agriculture O
and O
Food O
Security N
. O

Joyce H
's H
story N
is O
relevant O
for O
another O
reason N
, O
too O
. O

She O
is O
important O
to O
Africa O
's H
future N
not O
only O
because O
she O
is O
a O
farmer H
, O
but O
also O
because O
she O
is O
a O
woman H
. O

The O
world N
has O
had O
evidence N
of O
this O
gender N
gap N
since O
at O
least O
2011 O
, O
but O
only O
limited O
data N
about O
its O
scope N
, O
shape N
, O
and O
causes N
. O

To H
help O
us H
better O
understand O
the O
problem N
, O
the O
World N
Bank N
and O
the O
ONE O
Campaign N
recently O
conducted O
an O
unprecedented O
analysis N
of O
the O
challenges N
facing O
women H
farmers H
. O

Their O
report N
highlights O
one N
stark O
fact N
from O
the O
start O
: O

The O
gender N
gap N
is O
real O
, O
and O
in O
some O
cases N
it O
is O
extreme O
. O

When O
we H
compare O
male O
and O
female O
farmers H
with O
similar O
land O
sizes N
across O
similar O
settings N
, O
the O
productivity N
gap N
can O
be O
as O
high O
as O
66 O
% O
, O
as O
it O
is O
in O
Niger O
. O

Previously O
, O
experts H
believed O
that O
women H
's H
farms N
produced O
less O
because O
women H
have O
less O
access O
to O
inputs N
like O
fertilizer N
, O
water N
, O
and O
even O
information N
. O

But O
we H
now O
know O
that O
the O
story N
is O
much O
more O
complicated O
. O

With O
the O
new O
data N
in O
hand N
, O
we H
can O
see O
that O
, O
surprisingly O
, O
the O
productivity N
gap N
persists O
even O
when O
women H
have O
equal O
access O
to O
inputs N
. O

The O
precise O
reasons N
vary O
from O
country N
to O
country N
– O
but O
many O
of O
them O
stem O
from O
entrenched O
cultural O
norms N
that O
prevent O
women H
from O
reaching O
their O
full O
potential N
. O

For O
example N
, O
the O
report N
found O
that O
women H
face N
obstacles N
mobilizing O
the O
labor N
they O
need O
to O
help O
their O
farms N
flourish O
. O

Women H
usually O
have O
more O
childcare N
and O
household N
responsibilities N
than O
men H
, O
which O
make O
it O
difficult O
for O
them O
to O
devote O
as O
much O
time N
to O
farm N
work N
, O
or O
even O
to O
supervise O
hired O
labor N
. O

The O
problem N
is O
compounded O
by O
the O
fact N
that O
women H
are O
also O
likely O
to O
have O
less O
income N
to O
hire O
laborers H
in O
the O
first O
place N
. O

In O
some O
places N
, O
that O
may O
mean O
teaching O
agricultural O
extension N
workers H
how O
to O
make O
their O
messages N
more O
relevant O
to O
female O
audiences N
, O
or O
encouraging O
them O
to O
visit O
when O
women H
are O
most O
likely O
to O
be O
at O
home N
. O

In O
other O
places N
, O
it O
may O
mean O
increasing O
women H
's H
access O
to O
markets N
, O
or O
introducing O
labor N
- O
saving O
tools N
to O
help O
them O
get O
the O
highest O
yield N
from O
their O
land O
. O

It O
may O
also O
require O
establishing O
community N
childcare N
centers N
, O
so O
that O
women H
farmers H
have O
the O
option N
to O
spend O
more O
time N
farming O
. O

In O
every O
case N
, O
it O
will O
require O
African O
policymakers O
to O
start O
recognizing O
women H
farmers H
as O
the O
essential O
economic O
partners H
that O
they O
are O
. O

This O
June O
, O
leaders H
from O
all O
over O
Africa O
will O
meet O
in O
Malabo O
, O
Equatorial O
Guinea O
, O
to O
set O
the O
agenda N
for O
agricultural O
policy N
in O
the O
next O
decade N
. O

If O
Africa O
's H
agricultural O
sector N
is O
to O
achieve O
its O
promise N
– O
and O
if O
Africa O
's H
economic O
growth N
is O
to O
continue O
– O
policymakers O
should O
take O
into O
account O
the O
needs N
of O
farmers H
like O
Joyce H
. O

The O
Importance N
of O
Being O
Boring O
. O

WASHINGTON O
, O
DC O
– O
The O
International O
Monetary O
Fund N
is O
an O
immensely O
useful O
organization N
, O
able O
to O
deliver O
substantial O
amounts N
of O
financial O
and O
technical O
assistance N
at O
short O
notice O
to O
almost O
any O
place N
in O
the O
world N
. O

It O
also O
has O
the O
great O
advantage N
of O
almost O
always O
being O
perceived O
as O
incredibly O
boring O
. O

Unfortunately O
for O
the O
IMF O
, O
it O
now O
needs N
a O
slightly O
higher O
public O
profile N
to O
convince O
the O
US O
Congress N
to O
agree O
to O
some O
important O
reforms N
. O

The O
Ukrainian O
crisis N
may O
prove O
helpful O
, O
though O
that O
appears O
less O
likely O
now O
– O
which O
may O
be O
a O
good O
thing N
to O
the O
extent N
that O
one N
unintended O
consequence N
could O
be O
a O
loan N
to O
Ukraine O
that O
is O
larger O
than O
it O
really O
needs N
. O

From O
1918 O
to O
1939 O
, O
international O
economic O
cooperation N
was O
hard O
to O
come O
by O
– O
in O
large O
part N
because O
all O
of O
the O
attempted O
deals N
were O
put O
together O
at O
high O
- O
profile N
international O
conferences N
. O

Following O
the O
creation N
of O
the O
IMF O
in O
1944 O
, O
many O
of O
the O
same O
decisions N
became O
routine N
, O
a O
lot N
less O
interesting O
, O
and O
much O
easier O
to O
implement O
. O

The O
IMF O
rarely O
makes O
front N
- O
page N
headlines N
in O
the O
United O
States O
or O
other O
big O
countries N
, O
except O
when O
there O
is O
a O
racy O
personal O
dimension N
. O

The O
last O
time N
that O
many O
read O
a O
news N
story N
about O
the O
Fund N
may O
have O
been O
when O
then O
- O
Managing O
Director O
Dominique H
Strauss H
Kahn H
was O
forced O
out H
in O
May O
2011 O
, O
following O
accusations N
that O
he O
sexually O
assaulted O
an O
employee H
in O
a O
New H
York H
hotel N
. O

Since O
then O
, O
his O
successor N
, O
Christine H
Lagarde O
, O
has O
helped O
to O
restore O
the O
Fund N
's H
reputation N
– O
and O
to O
return O
coverage N
of O
its O
programs N
and O
activities N
to O
newspapers N
' O
dry H
and O
unemotional O
business N
sections N
. O

( O
When O
I H
worked O
at O
the O
IMF O
in O
the O
2000 O
' O
s H
, O
page N
- O
three O
coverage N
of O
our H
events N
by O
leading N
newspapers N
was O
typically O
viewed O
as O
preferable O
to O
top N
billing N
) O
. O

Of O
course N
, O
in O
countries N
receiving O
assistance N
– O
such O
as O
Greece O
in O
the O
last O
few O
years N
– O
the O
IMF O
excites O
great O
passion N
. O

But O
in O
the O
halls N
of O
the O
US O
Congress N
, O
few O
people N
pay O
any O
attention N
. O

In O
the O
highly O
charged O
partisan O
atmosphere N
of O
Washington H
, O
DC O
, O
this O
is O
without O
question N
almost O
always O
an O
advantage N
. O

Imagine O
if O
the O
disbursement N
of O
all O
assistance N
to O
countries N
in O
trouble N
required O
Congressional O
approval N
, O
let O
alone O
spending N
from O
the O
US O
budget N
. O

The O
reality N
is O
that O
it O
stands O
for O
and O
operationalizes O
US O
power N
, O
in O
cooperation N
with O
America O
's H
closest O
allies N
. O

Anyone O
who O
doubts N
that O
should O
review N
a O
recent O
letter N
orchestrated O
by O
the O
Bretton O
Woods H
Committee N
, O
addressed O
to O
Congressional O
leaders H
on O
behalf N
of O
an O
impressive O
array N
of O
former O
Republican O
and O
Democratic O
cabinet N
secretaries H
. O

" O
The O
US O
does O
not O
dictate O
what O
happens O
at O
the O
IMF O
, O
but O
it O
does O
have O
a O
disproportionate O
influence N
. O

Given O
the O
Fund N
's H
origins N
in O
helping O
to O
rebuild O
Europe O
after O
World N
War N
II O
, O
European O
countries N
are O
also O
very O
well O
represented O
on O
its O
executive O
board N
and O
in O
terms N
of O
ownership N
shares N
( O
and O
thus O
voting O
weight N
on O
important O
decisions N
) O
. O

One O
major O
goal N
in O
recent O
decades N
has O
been O
to O
shift N
representation N
at O
the O
IMF O
somewhat O
away O
from O
Europe O
and O
toward O
the O
world N
's H
emerging O
markets N
. O

( O
For O
the O
technical O
details N
, O
I H
recommend O
a O
recent O
paper N
by O
Edwin H
M. O
Truman H
, O
my H
colleague H
at O
the O
Peterson H
Institute N
for O
International O
Economics N
. O
) O

These O
reforms N
need O
to O
be O
agreed O
, O
in O
legislative O
form N
, O
by O
the O
US O
Congress N
before O
they O
can O
take O
effect N
. O

For O
whatever O
reason N
, O
President H
Barack H
Obama H
's H
administration N
did O
not O
push O
this O
item N
hard O
in O
2013 O
and O
early O
2014 O
– O
and O
the O
agenda N
of O
encouraging O
further O
IMF O
reform N
has O
therefore O
languished O
. O

The O
Obama H
administration N
proposed O
to O
tie N
IMF O
reform N
to O
the O
presumably O
imminent O
approval N
by O
Congress N
of O
funding N
for O
Ukraine O
. O

This O
is O
sensible O
legislative O
tactics N
but O
not O
appealing O
as O
an O
economic O
strategy N
. O

But O
the O
bigger O
problem N
is O
that O
Ukraine O
does O
not O
really O
need O
a O
massive O
loan N
from O
the O
IMF O
. O

What O
Ukraine O
needs N
is O
a O
sharp O
reduction N
in O
corruption N
, O
as O
well O
as O
real O
legitimacy N
( O
through O
the O
ballot N
box N
) O
for O
people N
who O
want O
to O
rein O
in O
the O
influence N
of O
oligarchs H
– O
a O
group N
that O
has O
sapped O
the O
economy N
through O
plunder N
and O
incompetence N
over O
the O
past N
two O
decades N
. O

IMF O
reform N

he O
could O
not O

grasp O
that O
rising O

well O
go O

a O

The O

problems N

, O
while O
Marx H
's H
belief N
that O
capital N

were O
substitutes N
, O
not O

was O
a O
mistake N

for O

it O

Think O
of O
it O
this O
way N

Humans A
have O
five O
core N
competencies N
as O
far O
as O
the O
world N
of O
work N
is O
concerned O
: O

· O
Moving O
things N
with O
large O
muscles N
. O

· O
Finely O
manipulating O
things N
with O
small O
muscles N
. O

· O
Using O
hands N
, O
mouths N
, O
brains N
, O
eyes N
, O
and O
ears N
to O
ensure O
that O
ongoing O
processes N
and O
procedures N
happen O
the O
way N
that O
they O
are O
supposed O
to O
. O

· O
Engaging O
in O
social O
reciprocity N
and O
negotiation N
to O
keep O
us H
all O
pulling O
in O
the O
same O
direction N
. O

· O
Thinking O
up O
new O
things N
– O
activities N
that O
produce O
outcomes N
that O
are O
necessary O
, O
convenient O
, O
or O
luxurious O
– O
for O
us H
to O
do O
. O

How O
many O
of O
us H
can O
be O
employed O
in O
personal O
services N
, O
and O
how O
can O
such O
jobs N
be O
highly O
paid O
( O
in O
absolute O
terms N
) O
? O

The O
optimistic O
view N
is O
that O
those O
, O
like O
me H
, O
who O
find O
ourselves H
fearing O
the O
relative O
wage N
distribution N
of O
the O
future N
as O
a O
source N
of O
mammoth O
inequality N
and O
power N
imbalance N
simply O
suffer O
from O
a O
failure N
of O
imagination N
. O

Marx H
did O
not O
see O
how O
the O
replacement H
of O
textile O
workers H
by O
automatic O
looms N
could O
possibly O
do O
anything O
other O
than O
lower O
workers H
' O
wages N
. O

After O
all O
, O
the O
volume N
of O
production N
could O
not O
possibly O
expand O
enough O
to O
reemploy O
everyone O
who O
lost O
their O
job N
as O
a O
handloom N
weaver H
as O
a O
machine N
- O
minder H
or O
a O
carpet N
- O
seller H
, O
could O
it O
? O

It O
could O
, O
but O
Marx H
's H
mistake N
was O
not O
a O
new O
one N
. O

A H
century N
earlier O
, O
the O
French O
physiocrats O
Quesnay O
, O
Turgot O
, O
and O
Condorcet O
did O
not O
see O
how O
the O
share O
of O
the O
French O
labor N
force N
employed O
in O
agriculture N
could O
possibly O
fall N
below O
50 O
% O
without O
producing O
social O
ruin N
. O

After O
all O
, O
in O
a O
world N
of O
solid N
farmers H
, O
useful O
craftsmen H
, O
dissolute O
aristocrats H
, O
and O
flunkies H
, O
demand N
for O
manufactured O
items N
and O
flunkies H
was O
limited O
by O
how O
much O
of O
each O
aristocrats H
could O
use H
. O

Thus O
, O
a O
decline N
in O
the O
number N
of O
farmers H
could O
produce O
no O
outcome N
other O
than O
poverty N
and O
widespread O
beggary N
. O

Neither O
Marx H
nor O
the O
physiocrats O
could O
imagine O
the O
great O
many O
well O
- O
paid O
things N
that O
we H
could O
find O
to O
do O
once O
we H
no O
longer O
needed O
to O
employ O
60 O
% O
of O
the O
labor N
force N
in O
agriculture N
and O
another O
20 O
% O
in O
hand N
spinning N
, O
handloom N
weaving N
, O
and O
land O
transport N
via O
horse A
and O
cart N
. O

And O
today N
, O
the O
optimistic O
view N
is O
that O
those O
with O
excess O
wealth N
will O
continue O
to O
think O
of O
lots N
of O
things N
for O
everyone O
else O
to O
do O
to O
make O
their O
lives O
more O
convenient O
and O
luxurious O
, O
and O
that O
the O
ingenuity N
of O
the O
rich O
will O
outstrip O
the O
supply N
of O
labor N
by O
the O
poor O
and O
turn O
the O
poor O
into O
the O
middle O
class N
. O

But O
, O
given O
the O
rapid O
development N
of O
technologies N
of O
governance N
and O
control N
, O
the O
pessimistic O
view N
deserves O
attention N
. O

In O
this O
scenario N
, O
pieces N
of O
option N
three O
remain O
stubbornly O
impervious O
to O
artificial O
intelligence N
and O
continue O
to O
be O
mind N
- O
numbingly O
boring O
, O
while O
option N
four O
– O
engaging O
in O
social O
reciprocity N
and O
negotiation N
– O
remains O
limited O
. O

The O

Temptation N

There O
is O
nothing N
phony O
, O
however O
, O
about O
the O
efforts N
we H
Ukrainians N
are O
now O
making O
to O
defend O
our H
country N
and O
our H
democracy N
. O

Our H
young O
men H
and O
women H
are O
volunteering O
for O
military O
service N
like O
never O
before O
. O

Our H
government N
has O
negotiated O
a O
standby O
loan N
agreement N
with O
the O
International O
Monetary O
Fund N
that O
will O
give O
us H
some O
of O
the O
tools N
that O
we H
need O
to O
get O
our H
financial O
and O

house N

That O
agreement N

also O
impose O

but O
Ukrainians N
are O
willing O
to O
pay O
the O
price N
in O
order O
to O
preserve O
our H
independence N

After O
a O
time N
of O
neglect N
, O
a O
time N
when O
we H
– O
like O
the O
rest N
of O
Europe O
– O
believed O
that O
the O
continent N

would O
never O
again O
be O
changed O
by O
force N

we H
are O
also O
increasing O

despite O
our H

precarious O
state N

There O
will O
be O
no O
more O
surrendering O

Ukrainian O
territory N

Most O

despite O
the O
Russian O
army N
massed O
against O
us H
, O
we H
are O
embarking O
on O
an O
election N
campaign N

Russian O
President H
Vladimir H
Putin H
's H
recent O
phone N
call O
to O
US O
President H
Barack H
Obama H
to O
seek O
renewed O
diplomatic O
talks N
, O
followed O
by O
a O
Russian O
white O
paper N
on O
how O
to O
resolve O
a O
crisis N
of O
the O
Kremlin O
's H
making O
, O
is O
in O
fact N
a O
peace N
offensive O
that O
is O
offensive O
to O
peace N
. O

Putin H
's H
gambit N
is O
akin O
to O
the O
infamous O
Yalta O
Conference N
in O
1945 O
, O
where O
Joseph H
Stalin H
made O
Winston H
Churchill H
and O
Franklin H
D. O
Roosevelt H
complicit O
in O
a O
division N
of O
Europe O
that O
enslaved O
half O
of O
the O
continent N
for O
almost O
a O
half O
- O
century N
. O

Today N
, O
Putin H
is O
seeking O
to O
make O
the O
West O
complicit O
in O
the O
dismemberment N
of O
Ukraine O
by O
negotiating O
a O
Kremlin O
- O
designed O
federal O
constitution N
that O
would O
create O
a O
dozen N
Crimeas O
– O
bite N
- O
size N
chunks N
that O
Russia O
could O
devour O
more O
easily O
later O
. O

Of O
course N
, O
federalism N
sounds N
like O
a O
good O
thing N
. O

Devolving O
political O
power N
closer O
to O
where O
people N
actually O
live O
is O
always O
, O
appealing O
and O
usually O
effective O
. O

But O
the O
wellbeing N
of O
Ukrainian O
democracy N
is O
not O
what O
Putin H
has O
in O
mind N
; O

for O
him O
, O
a O
federal O
system N
is O
a O
means N
for O
the O
Kremlin O
to O
make O
political O
mischief N
and O
ultimately O
incorporate O
Ukraine O
's H
eastern O
and O
southern O
regions N
into O
the O
Russian O
Federation N
. O

To H
paraphrase O
Clausewitz O
, O
federalism N
for O
Putin H
is O
annexation N
by O
other O
means N
. O

One O
has O
only O
to O
look O
at O
the O
Russian O
proposal N
's H
fine O
print N
: O

Ukraine O
's H
new O
federal O
units N
would O
have O
a O
powerful O
say O
over O
" O
Ukraine O
's H
foreign O
- O
policy N
direction N
. O

" O
That O
provision N
would O
enable O
Putin H
to O
try O
to O
coerce O
and O
manipulate O
Russian O
- O
speaking O
regions N
into O
vetoing O
the O
country N
's H
European O
future N
. O

Ukraine O
's H
constitutional O
structure N
is O
for O
Ukraine O
's H
citizens H
alone O
to O
decide O
. O

Russia O
can O
have O
no O
say O
in O
it O
– O
and O
nor O
should O
other O
countries N
, O
however O
helpful O
they O
wish O
to O
be O
. O

Ukraine O
is O
not O
Bosnia O
, O
where O
the O
constitution N
emerged O
out H
of O
peace N
talks N
that O
ended O
years N
of O
bloody O
warfare N
following O
the O
breakup N
of O
Yugoslavia O
. O

Nor O
is O
it O
Kosovo O
, O
which O
became O
independent O
at O
the O
same O
time N
that O
its O
governmental O
structures N
were O
being O
forged O
. O

Ukraine O
is O
a O
fully O
sovereign O
state N
, O
recognized O
as O
such O
by O
the O
world N
, O
including O
Russia O
. O

To H
buy O
into O
Putin H
's H
sham O
federalism N
is O
to O
accept O
the O
lies N
that O
the O
Kremlin O
has O
been O
spewing O
about O
Ukraine O
's H
current O
interim O
government N
and O
the O
brave O
men H
and O
women H
who O
ousted O
Yanukovych O
. O

Putin H
's H
factotums H
claim O
that O
Ukraine O
's H
Russian O
speakers H
are O
under O
threat N
, O
but O
they O
cannot O
can O
not O
point N
to O
a O
single O
example N
of O
persecution N
that O
might O
bear O
this O
out H
. O

No O
Russian O
- O
speaking O
refugees H
from O
eastern O
Ukraine O
or O
Crimea O
have O
fled O
into O
Russia O
, O
and O
no O
Russian O
- O
speaker N
has O
sought O
political O
asylum N
anywhere O
else O
outside O
the O
country N
. O

The O
reason N
is O
simple O
: O

there O
is O
no O
oppression N
of O
Russian O
speakers H
in O
Ukraine O
, O
and O
there O
never O
has O
been O
. O

Ukraine O
's H
government N
under O
Yanukovych O
was O
incompetent O
, O
corrupt O
, O
and O
mendacious O
. O

But O
it O
was O
an O
equal O
- O
opportunity N
oppressor H
. O

So O
should O
Ukraine O
really O
be O
forced O
to O
create O
a O
new O
constitutional O
order O
based O
on O
the O
Big O
Lie N
? O

What O
we H
need O
is O
a O
competent O
, O
efficient O
, O
and O
corruption N
- O
free O
government N
. O

And O
with O
Europe O
's H
help O
and O
technical O
assistance N
, O
we H
will O
establish O
one N
. O

The O
desire N
of O
diplomats H
to O
find O
a O
peaceful O
solution N
to O
Ukraine O
's H
crisis N
is O
understandable O
. O

But O
the O
terms N
that O
Russia O
is O
demanding O
, O
if O
accepted O
by O
the O
West O
, O
would O
fatally O
undermine O
Ukraine O
's H
sovereignty N
; O

worse O
, O
accepting O
Russia O
's H
terms N
would O
ratify O
the O
idea N
that O
powerful O
countries N
may O
bully H
less O
powerful O
neighbors H
into O
doing O
their O
bidding N
, O
to O
the O
point N
of O
surrendering O
their O
independence N
. O

Ukraine O
will O
stand O
up O
to O
the O
bully H
– O
on O
our H
own O
, O
if O
necessary O
. O

We H
refuse O
to O
play O
the O
part N

hapless O

Menace N

STANFORD O
– O
Mosquito O
- O
borne O
diseases N
kill O
millions N
of O
people N
annually O
, O
and O
cause N
suffering N
for O
many O
more O
. O

In O
2012 O
, O
there O
were O
an O
estimated O
207 O
million O
cases N
of O
malaria N
, O
leading N
to O
some O
627,000 O
deaths N
. O

Dengue O
fever N
is O
a O
leading N
cause N
of O
illness N
and O
death N
in O
the O
tropics N
and O
subtropics N
, O
with O
as O
many O
as O
100 O
million O
people N
infected O
each O
year N
. O

It O
takes O
only O
one N
bite N
from O
a O
disease N
- O
carrying O
mosquito A
to O
transmit O
a O
debilitating O
or O
deadly O
infection N
– O
and O
mosquitoes A
breed O
and O
multiply O
with O
astonishing O
speed N
. O

Given O
that O
there O
are O
no O
vaccines N
or O
drug N
treatments N
for O
illnesses N
like O
dengue O
fever N
and O
West O
Nile O
virus N
, O
and O
that O
treatments N
for O
diseases N
like O
malaria N
are O
difficult O
to O
access O
in O
many O
at O
- O
risk N
areas N
, O
more O
effective O
mechanisms N
for O
controlling O
mosquito A
populations N
are O
desperately O
needed O
. O

The O
good O
news N
is O
that O
a O
promising O
new O
technology N
is O
ready O
for O
field-testing O
. O

It O
is O
now O
up O
to O
government N
agencies N
to O
facilitate O
its O
development N
. O

Today N
, O
the O
dominant O
method N
for O
reducing O
insect A
populations N
– O
the O
so-called O
" O
sterile O
insect A
technique N
" O
( O
SIT O
) O
– O
relies O
on O
radiation N
to O
sterilize O
males A
, O
which O
are O
then O
released O
into O
infested O
areas N
to O
mate O
. O

But O
this O
approach N
, O
which O
has O
been O
used O
since O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
last O
century N
, O
has O
not O
been O
effective O
with O
mosquitoes A
, O
owing O
to O
their O
fragility N
. O

Advances N
in O
molecular O
biology N
offer O
analogous O
– O
but O
far O
more O
sophisticated O
– O
solutions N
. O

Using O
molecular O
genetic O
- O
engineering N
techniques N
, O
the O
British O
company N
Oxitec O
has O
created O
a O
new O
way N
to O
control N
the O
mosquito A
species A
that O
transmits O
dengue O
fever N
. O

Male O
mosquitoes A
do O
not O
bite N
, O
so O
their O
release N
presents O
no O
health N
risk N
, O
and O
, O
because O
their O
progeny H
die O
, O
no O
genetically O
engineered O
mosquitoes A
persist O
in O
the O
environment N
. O

If O
the O
males A
are O
released O
over O
a O
period N
of O
several O
months N
, O
this O
would O
, O
in O
theory N
, O
result N
in O
a O
marked O
reduction N
in O
the O
mosquito A
population N
. O

All O
that O
is O
needed O
now O
is O
to O
determine O
whether O
it O
works O
in O
practice O
. O

Scientific O
research N
to O
develop O
products N
like O
irradiated O
sterile O
insects A
or O
the O
Oxitec O
mosquitoes A
proceeds O
progressively O
from O
more O
to O
less O
contained O
conditions N
– O
from O
the O
laboratory N
to O
confined O
trials N
to O
limited O
field N
trials N
. O

Now O
that O
Oxitec O
has O
conducted O
promising O
field N
trials N
in O
the O
Cayman O
Islands N
, O
Malaysia O
, O
and O
Brazil O
, O
it O
is O
preparing O
to O
conduct O
trials N
in O
other O
countries N
, O
including O
the O
United O
States O
. O

In O
order O
to O
determine O
the O
appropriate O
level N
of O
oversight N
, O
government N
bodies N
would O
presumably O
conduct O
a O
science N
- O
based O
risk N
analysis N
. O

The O
fact N
is O
that O
molecular O
genetic O
engineering N
is O
more O
precise O
and O
predictable O
than O
older O
, O
cruder O
techniques N

As O
a O
result N
, O
research N
and O
development N
in O
genetic O
engineering N
is O
more O
expensive O
, O
discouraging O
investment N

hampering O
innovation N
. O

This O
is O
all O
the O
more O
problematic O
in O
the O

PRINCETON O
– O
German O
Finance N
Minister H
Wolfgang H
Schäuble O
recently O
declared O
that O
the O
European O
Union O
has O
" O
moved O
sovereignty N
to O
the O
European O
level N
" O
– O
a O
startling O
claim O
, O
given O
that O
European O
governments N
seem O
to O
be O
pursuing O
their O
national O
interests N
more O
aggressively O
than O
at O
any O
time N
since O
World N
War N
II O
. O

Was O
Schauble O
's H
statement N
supposed O
to O
serve O
as O
a O
rallying O
cry N
for O
greater O
European O
solidarity N
? O

While O
Schauble O
's H
strategy N
may O
sound N
appealing O
, O
it O
is O
, O
at O
best O
, O
the O
symbolic O
garb N
of O
progress N
. O

For O
starters H
, O
the O
common O
funds N
are O
meager O
, O
with O
no O
prospect N
of O
being O
increased O
– O
not O
least O
because O
of O
Germany H
's H
unrelenting O
opposition N
. O

Likewise O
, O
so O
long O
as O
member N
countries N
maintain O
fiscal O
sovereignty N
, O
a O
new O
mechanism N
to O
facilitate O
finger N
- O
wagging O
at O
countries N
that O
defy O
European O
budget N
rules N
will O
change O
nothing N
. O

Over O
the O
last O
two O
decades N
, O
every O
effort N
to O
discipline O
the O
EU O
's H
fiscal O
delinquents H
has O
failed O
, O
owing O
to O
the O
lack N
of O
enforcement N
authority N
. O

Even O
as O
Germany H
's H
Bundesbank O
fiercely O
( O
and O
rightly O
) O
opposed O
the O
OMT O
program N
for O
its O
focus O
on O
countries N
' O
solvency N
, O
rather O
than O
liquidity N
risk N
– O
thus O
creating O
a O
backdoor N
fiscal O
union N
– O
the O
government N
was O
relieved O
that O
the O
German O
Constitutional O
Court N
, O
assessing O
the O
scheme N
's H
legality N
, O
ultimately O
passed O
the O
buck N
to O
the O
European O
Court N
of O
Justice H
. O

The O
EU O
is O
an O
inspiring O
political O
structure N
that O
seeks O
to O
break O
the O
mold N
of O
the O
nineteenth O
- O
century N
nation N
- O
state N
. O

But O
progress N
toward O
that O
idealistic O
vision N
cannot O
can O
not O
continue O
to O
depend O
on O
shopworn O
symbolism N
. O

The O
euro N
was O
the O
most O
audacious O
of O
those O
symbols N
– O
a O
construct O
of O
dubious O
economic O
value N
, O
with O
well O
- O
documented O
fragilities N
. O

Its O
adoption N
was O
an O
act N
of O
economic O
hubris N
that O
has O
imposed O
costs O
well O
beyond O
Europe O
's H
borders N
. O

Today N
, O
European O
leaders H
are O
indulging O
in O
triumphalism O
, O
viewing O
the O
current O
economic O
reprieve N
as O
a O
validation N
of O
failed O
transnational O
governance N
structures N
. O

But O
the O
depth N
and O
persistence N
of O
the O
ongoing O
crisis N
have O
exposed O
the O
euro N
's H
fundamental O
fragilities N
, O
and O
should O
serve O
as O
a O
warning N
that O
today N
's H
technocratic O
Band N
- O
Aids O
may O
not O
hold O
in O
the O
face N
of O
another O
shock N
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
bold O
action N
to O
address N
these O
fragilities N
seems O
more O
distant O
than O
ever O
. O

Balzac O
( O
20 O
May O
1799 O
- O
18 O
August O
1850 O
) O
was O
a O
French O
novelist H
and O
playwright H
. O

His O
magnum N
opus N
was O
a O
sequence N
of O
short O
stories N
and O
novels N
collectively O
entitled O
La O
Comédie O
humaine O
, O
which O
presents O
a O
panorama N
of O
French O
life N
in O
the O
years N
after O
the O
1815 O
fall N
of O
Napoleon H
Bonaparte H
. O

Due O
to O
his O
keen O
observation N
of O
detail N
and O
unfiltered O
representation N
of O
society N
, O
Balzac O
is O
regarded O
as O
one N
of O
the O
founders H
of O
realism N
in O
European O
literature N
. O

His O
writing N
influenced O
many O
subsequent O
novelists H
such O
as O
Marcel H
Proust O
, O
Émile O
Zola O
, O
Charles H
Dickens H
, O
Edgar H
Allan H
Poe H
, O

, O
and O
Italo O
Calvino O
, O
and O
philosophers H
such O
as O
Friedrich H
Engels O
and O
Karl H
Marx H
. O

Many O
of O
Balzac O
's H
works O
have O
been O
made O
into O
or O
have O
inspired O
films N
, O
and O
they O
are O
a O
continuing O
source N
of O
inspiration N
for O
writers H
, O
filmmakers H
and O
critics H
. O

An O
enthusiastic O
reader H
and O
independent O
thinker H
as O
a O
child H
, O
Balzac O
had O
trouble N
adapting O
to O
the O
teaching O
style N
of O
his O
grammar N
school N
. O

His O
willful O
nature N
caused O
trouble N
throughout O
his O
life N
and O
frustrated O
his O
ambitions N
to O
succeed O
in O
the O
world N
of O
business N
. O

When O
he O
finished O
school N
, O
Balzac O
was O
an O
apprentice H
in O
a O
law N
office N
, O
but O
he O
turned O
his O
back O
on O
the O
study O
of O
law N
after O
wearying O
of O
its O
inhumanity N
and O
banal O
routine N
. O

Before O
and O
during O
his O
career N
as O
a O
writer H
, O
he O
attempted O
to O
be O
a O
publisher N
, O
printer H
, O
businessman H
, O
critic H
, O
and O
politician H
; O

he O
failed O
in O
all O
of O
these O
efforts N
. O

La O
Comédie O
humaine O
reflects O
his O
real O
- O
life N
difficulties N
, O
and O
includes O
scenes N
from O
his O
own O
experience N
. O

Balzac O
suffered O
from O
health N
problems N
throughout O
his O
life N
, O
possibly O
due O
to O
his O
intense O
writing N
schedule N
. O

His O
relationship N
with O
his O
family H
was O
often O
strained O
by O
financial O
and O
personal O
difficulties N
, O
and O
he O
ended O
several O
friendships N
over O
critical O
reviews N
. O

In O
1850 O
he O
married O
Ewelina O
Hanska O
, O
his O
longtime O
love O
; O

he O
died O
five O
months N
later O
. O

Honoré O
De H
Balzac O
was O
born O
into O
a O
family H
which O
had O
struggled O
nobly O
to O
achieve O
respectability N
. O

His O
father H
, O
born O
Bernard H

was O
one N
of O
eleven O
children H
from O
a O
poor O
family H
in O
Tarn O
, O
a O
region N
in O
the O
south O
of O
France O
. O

In O
1760 O
the O
elder H
Balzac O
set O
off O
for O
Paris H
with O
only O
a O
louis H
coin N
in O
his O
pocket N
, O
determined O
to O
improve O
his O
social O
standing N
; O

by O
1776 O
he O
had O
become O
Secretary H
to O
the O
King H
's H
Council N
and O
a O
Freemason H
. O

He O
had O
also O
changed O
his O
name N
to O
that O
of O
an O
ancient O
noble O
family H
, O
and O
added O
- O
without O
any O
official O
cause N

the O
nobiliary O
particle N
De H

After O
the O
Reign N

Terror O
( O
1793 O
– O
94 O
) O
, O
he O
was O
sent O
to O

his O
brother H

As O
an O
infant H
Balzac O
was O
sent O
to O
a O
wet-nurse H
; O

the O
following O
year N
he O
was O
joined O
by O
his O
sister H

they O
spent O
four O
years N
away O
from O
home N

( O
Although O
Genevan O

influential O
book O
Émile O
convinced O
many O
mothers H
of O
the O
time N
to O
nurse O
their O
own O
children H
, O
sending O
babies H
to O
wet-nurses H
was O
still O
common O
among O
the O
middle O
and O
upper O
classes N
. O
) O

When O
the O
Balzac O
children H
returned O
home N
, O
they O
were O
kept O
at O
a O
frigid O
distance N
by O
their O
parents H
, O
which O
affected O
the O
author H
- O
to O
- O
be O
significantly O
. O

His O
1835 O
novel N
Le O
Lys O
dans O
La O
Vallée O
features O
a O
cruel O
governess H
named O
Miss O
Caroline H
, O
modeled O
after O
his O
own O
caregiver H
. O

At O
age N
ten O
Balzac O
was O
sent O
to O
the O
Oratorian O
grammar N
school N
in O
Vendôme O
, O
where O
he O
studied O
for O
seven O
years N
. O

His O
father H
, O
seeking O
to O
instill O
the O
same O
hardscrabble O
work N
ethic N
which O
had O
gained O
him O
the O
esteem N
of O
society N
, O
intentionally O
gave O
little O
spending N
money N
to O
the O
boy H
. O

This O
made O
him O
the O
object N
of O
ridicule N
among O
his O
much O
wealthier O
schoolmates H
. O

As O
a O
result N
, O
he O
was O
frequently O
sent O
to O
the O
" O
alcove N
, O
" O
a O
punishment N
cell N
reserved O
for O
disobedient O
students H
. O

Balzac O
worked O
these O
scenes N
from O
his O
boyhood N
- O
as O
he O
did O
many O
aspects N
of O
his O
life N
and O
the O
lives O
of O
those O
around O
him O
- O
into O
La O
Comédie O
Humaine O
. O

" O
He O
devoured O
books N
of O
every O
kind N
, O
feeding O
indiscriminately O
on O
religious O
works O
, O
history N
and O
literature N
, O
philosophy N
and O
physics N
. O

He O
had O
told O
me H
that O
he O
found O
indescribable O
delight N
in O
reading O
dictionaries N
for O
lack N
of O
other O
books N
. O

" O
Balzac O
often O
fell O
ill O
, O
finally O
causing O
the O
headmaster H
to O
contact O
his O
family H
with O
news N
of O
a O
" O
sort N
of O
a O
coma N
" O
. O

When O
he O
returned O
home N
, O
his O
grandmother H
said O
: O

" O
Look O
how O
the O
academy N
returns O
the O
pretty O
ones N
we H
send O
them O
! O

" O
Balzac O
himself O
attributed O
his O
condition N
to O
" O
intellectual O
congestion N
" O
, O
but O
his O
extended O
confinement N
in O
the O
" O
alcove N
" O
was O
surely O
a O
factor N
. O

( O
Meanwhile O
, O
his O
father H
had O
been O
writing N
a O
treatise N
on O
" O
the O
means N
of O
preventing O
thefts N
and O
murders O
, O
and O
of O
restoring O
the O
men H
who O
commit O
them O
to O
a O
useful O
role N
in O
society N
" O
, O
in O
which O
he O
heaped O
disdain N
on O
prison N
as O
a O
form N
of O
crime N
prevention N
. O
) O

In O
1814 O
the O
Balzac O
family H
moved O
to O
Paris H
, O
and O
Honoré O
was O
sent O
to O
private O
tutors H
and O
schools N
for O
the O
next O
two O
and O
a O
half O
years N
. O

This O
was O
an O
unhappy O
time N
in O
his O
life N
, O
during O
which O
he O
attempted O
suicide N
on O
a O
bridge N
over O
the O
Loire O
River N
. O

In O
1816 O
Balzac O
entered O
the O
Sorbonne O
, O
where O
he O
studied O
under O
three O
famous O
professors H
. O

François H
Guizot O
, O
who O
later O
became O
Prime O
Minister H
, O
was O
Professor O
of O
Modern O
History N
. O

Abel H
- O
François H
Villemain O
, O
a O
recent O
arrival H
from O
the O
Collège O
Charlemagne O
, O
lectured O
on O
French O
and O
classical O
literature N
. O

And O
- O
most O
influential O
of O
all O
- O
Victor H
Cousin O
's H
courses N
on O
philosophy N
encouraged O
his O
students H
to O
think O
independently O
. O

Once O
his O
studies N
were O
completed O
, O
Balzac O
was O
persuaded O
by O
his O
father H
to O
follow O
him O
into O
the O
law N
; O

for O
three O
years N
he O
trained O
and O
worked O
at O
the O
office N
of O
Victor H
Passez O
, O
a O
family H
friend H
. O

During O
this O
time N
Balzac O
began O
to O
understand O
the O
vagaries N
of O
human O
nature N
. O

In O
his O
1840 O
novel N
Le O
Notaire O
, O
he O
wrote O
that O
a O
young O
person H
in O
the O
legal O
profession N
sees O
" O
the O
oily O
wheels N
of O
every O
fortune N
, O
the O
hideous O
wrangling O
of O
heirs H
over O
corpses N
not O
yet O
cold O
, O
the O
human O
heart N
grappling O
with O
the O
Penal O
Code N
. O
" O

In O
1819 O
Passez O
offered O
to O
make O
Balzac O
his O
successor N
, O
but O
his O
apprentice H
had O
enough O
of O
the O
law N
. O

He O
despaired O
of O
being O
" O
a O
clerk H
, O
a O
machine N
, O
a O
riding N
- O
school N
hack H
, O
eating O
and O
drinking O
and O
sleeping O
at O
fixed O
hours N
. O

I H
should O
be O
like O
everyone O
else O
. O

And O
that O
's H
what O
they O
call O
living O
, O
that O
life N
at O
the O
grindstone N
, O
doing O
the O
same O
thing N
over O
and O
over O
again O
.... O

I H
am O
hungry O
and O
nothing N
is O
offered O
to O
appease O
my H
appetite N
. O

" O
He O
announced O
his O
intention N
to O
be O
a O
writer H
. O

The O
loss N
of O
this O
opportunity N
caused O
serious O
discord N
in O
the O
Balzac O
household N
, O
although O
Honoré O
was O
not O
turned O
away O
entirely O
. O

Instead O
, O
in O
April O
1819 O
he O
was O
allowed O
to O
live O
in O
the O
French O
capital N
- O
as O
English O
critic H
George H
Saintsbury O
describes O
it O
- O
" O
in O
a O
garret N
furnished O
in O
the O
most O
Spartan O
fashion N
, O
with O
a O
starvation N
allowance N
and O
an O
old O
woman H
to O
look O
after O
him O
" O
, O
while O
the O
rest N
of O
the O
family H
moved O
to O
a O
house N
twenty O
miles N
[ O
32 O
km N
] O
outside O
Paris H
. O

Balzac O
's H
first O
project N
was O
a O
libretto N
for O
a O
comic O
opera N
called O
Le O
Corsaire O
, O
based O
on O
Lord H
Byron H
's H
The O
Corsair H
. O

Realizing O
he O
would O
have O
trouble N
finding O
a O
composer H
, O
however O
, O
he O
turned O
to O
other O
pursuits N
. O

In O
1820 O
Balzac O
completed O
the O
five O
- O
act N
verse N
tragedy N
Cromwell H
. O

Although O
it O
pales O
in O
comparison N

later O
works O
, O
some O
critics H
consider O
it O
a O
quality N

When O
he O
finished O
, O
Balzac O
went O
to O
Villeparisis O
and O
read O
the O
entire O
work N
to O
his O
family H
; O

they O
were O
unimpressed O
. O

He O
followed O
this O
effort N
by O
starting O
( O
but O
never O
finishing N
) O
three O
novels N
: O

Sténie O
, O
Falthurne O
, O
and O
Corsino O
. O

In O
1821 O
Balzac O
met O
the O
enterprising O
Auguste H
Lepoitevin O
, O
who O
convinced O
the O
author H
to O
write O
short O
stories N
, O
which O
Lepoitevin O
would O
then O
sell O
to O
publishers N
. O

Balzac O
quickly O
turned O
to O
longer O
works O
, O
and O
by O
1826 O
he O
had O
written O
nine O
novels N
, O
all O
published O
under O
pseudonyms N
and O
often O
produced O
in O
collaboration N
with O
other O
writers H
. O

For O
example N
, O
the O
scandalous O
novel N
Vicaire O
des O
Ardennes O
( O
1822 O
) O
- O
banned O
for O
its O
depiction N
of O
nearly O
- O
incestuous O
relations N
and O
, O
more O
egregiously O
, O
of O
a O
married O
priest H
- O
attributed O
to O
a O
' O
Horace H
De H
Saint H
- O
Aubin O
' O
. O

These O
books N
were O
potboiler N
novels N
, O
designed O
to O
sell O
quickly O
and O
titillate O
audiences N
. O

In O
Saintsbury O
's H
view N
, O
" O
They O
are O
curiously O
, O
interestingly O
, O
almost O
enthrallingly O
bad O
. O

Biographer O
Graham H
Robb O
suggests O
that O
as O
he O
discovered O
the O
Novel N
, O
Balzac O
discovered O
himself O
. O

During O
this O
time N
Balzac O
wrote O
two O
pamphlets N
in O
support N
of O
primogeniture N
and O
the O
Society N
of O
Jesus H
. O

The O
latter N
, O
regarding O
the O
Jesuit H
order O
, O
illustrated O
his O
lifelong O
admiration N
for O
the O
Catholic H
Church N
. O

In O
the O
preface N
to O
La O
Comédie O
Humaine O
he O
wrote O
: O

" O
Christianity O
, O
and O
especially O
Catholicism N
, O
being O
a O
complete O
repression N
of O
man H
's H
depraved O
tendencies N
, O
is O
the O
greatest O
element N
in O
Social O
Order N
. O
" O

His O
first O
venture N
was O
a O
publishing O
enterprise N
which O
turned O
out H
cheap O
one N
- O
volume N
editions N
of O
French O
classics N
including O
the O
works O
of O
Molière O
. O

This O
business N
failed O
miserably O
, O
with O
many O
of O
the O
books N
" O
sold O
as O
waste O
paper N
" O
. O

Balzac O
had O
better O
luck N
publishing O
the O
memoirs N
of O
Laure O
Junot O
, O
Duchess O
of O
Abrantès O
- O
with O
whom O
he O
also O
had O
an O
affair N
. O

Balzac O
borrowed O
money N
from O
his O
family H
and O
friends H
, O
and O
tried O
to O
build O
a O
printing O
business N
, O
then O
a O
typefounder O
enterprise N
. O

His O
inexperience N
and O
lack N
of O
capital N
caused O
his O
ruin N
in O
these O
trades N
. O

He O
gave O
the O
businesses N
to O
a O
friend H
( O
who O
made O
them O
successful O
) O
but O
carried O
the O
debts N
for O
many O
years N
. O

As O
of O
April O
1828 O
Balzac O
owed O
50,000 O
francs N
to O
his O
mother H
. O

Balzac O
never O
lost O
his O
penchant N
for O
une O
bonne O
spéculation O
. O

It O
resurfaced O
painfully O
later O
when O
- O
as O
a O
renowned O
and O
busy O
author H
- O
he O
traveled O
to O
Sardinia O
in O
the O
hopes N
of O
reprocessing O
the O
slag N
from O
the O
Roman H
mines H
in O
that O
country N
. O

After O
writing N
several O
novels N
, O
in O
1832 O
Balzac O
conceived O
the O
idea N
for O
an O
enormous O
series N
of O
books N
that O
would O
paint O
a O
panoramic O
portrait N
of O
" O
all O
aspects N
of O
society N
. O

" O
I H
am O
about O
to O
become O
a O
genius N
. O

" O
Although O
he O
originally O
called O
it O
Etudes O
des O
Mœurs O
( O
Study N
of O
Mores O
) O
, O
it O
eventually O
became O
known O
as O
La O
Comédie O
Humaine O
, O
and O
he O
included O
in O
it O
all O
the O
fiction N
that O
he O
had O
published O
in O
his O
lifetime N
under O
his O
own O
name N
. O

This O
was O
to O
be O
Balzac O
's H
life N
work N
and O
his O
greatest O
achievement N
. O

After O
the O
collapse N
of O
his O
businesses N
, O
Balzac O
traveled O
to O
Brittany H
and O
stayed O
with O
the O
De H
Pommereul O
family H
outside O
Fougères O
. O

There O
he O
drew O
inspiration N
for O
Les H
Chouans O
( O
1829 O
) O
, O
a O
tale N
of O
love O
gone O
wrong O
amid O
the O
Chouan O
royalist H
forces N
. O

This O
was O
the O
first O
book O
Balzac O
released O
under O
his O
own O
name N
, O
and O
it O
gave O
him O
what O
one N
critic H
called O
" O
passage N
into O
the O
Promised O
Land N
" O
. O

It O
established O
him O
as O
an O
author H
of O
note N
( O
even O
if O
the O
surface N
owes O
a O
debt N
to O
Walter H
Scott H
) O
and O
provided O
him O
with O
a O
name N
outside O
his O
past N
pseudonyms N
. O

Soon O
afterwards O
, O
around O
the O
time N
of O
his O
father H
's H
death N
, O
Balzac O
wrote O
El H
Verdugo O
- O
about O
a O
30 O
- O
year N
- O
old O
man H
who O
kills O
his O
father H
( O
Balzac O
was O
30 O
years N
old O
at O
the O
time N
) O
. O

This O
was O
the O
first O
work N
signed O
" O
Honoré O
De H
Balzac O
" O
. O

Like O
his O
father H
, O
he O
added O
the O
aristocratic O
- O
sounding O
particle N
to O
help O
him O
fit O
into O
respected O
society N
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
choice N
based O
on O
skill N
, O
not O
birthright N
. O

" O
The O
aristocracy N
and O
authority N
of O
talent N
are O
more O
substantial O
than O
the O
aristocracy N
of O
names N
and O
material O
power N
" O
, O
he O
wrote O
in O
1830 O
. O

The O
timing N
of O
the O
decision N
was O
also O
significant O
; O

" O
The O
disappearance N
of O
the O
father H
coincides O
with O
the O
adoption N
of O
the O
nobiliary O
particle N
. O

" O
Just O
as O
his O
father H
had O
worked O
his O
way N
up O
from O
poverty N
into O
respectable O
society N
, O
Balzac O
considered O
toil N
and O
effort N
his O
real O
mark N
of O
nobility N
. O

When O
the O
July O
Revolution N
overthrew O
Charles H
X O
in O
1830 O
, O
Balzac O
declared O
himself O
a O
Legitimist O
, O
supporting O
Charles H
' O
House O
of O
Bourbon O
- O
but O
with O
qualifications N
. O

He O
felt N
that O
the O
new O
July O
Monarchy O
( O
which O
claimed O
widespread O
popular O
support N
) O
was O
disorganized O
and O
unprincipled O
, O
in O
need O
of O
a O
mediator H
to O
keep O
the O
political O
peace N
between O
the O
King H
and O
insurgent O
forces N
. O

But O
after O
a O
near O
- O
fatal O
accident N
in O
1832 O
( O
he O
slipped O
and O
his O
head N
on O
the O
street N
) O
, O
Balzac O
decided O
not O
to O
stand O
for O
election N
. O

1831 O
saw O
the O
success N
of O
La O
Peau O
De H
Chagrin O
( O
The O
Wild O
Ass H
's H
Skin N
or O
The O
Magic O
skin N
) O
, O
a O
fable N
- O
like O
tale N
about O
a O
despondent O
young O
man H
named O
Raphaël O
De H
Valentin O
who O
finds O
an O
animal A
skin N
which O
promises O
great O
power N
and O
wealth N
. O

He O
obtains O
these O
things N
, O
but O
loses O
the O
ability N
to O
manage O
them O
. O

Balzac O
meant O
the O
story N
to O
bear O
witness N
to O
the O
treacherous O
turns N
of O
life N
, O
its O
" O
serpentine O
motion N
. O

" O
In O
1833 O
Balzac O
released O
Eugénie O
Grandet O
, O
his O
first O
best-selling O
novel N
. O

The O
tale N
of O
a O
young O
lady H
who O
inherits O
her O
father H
's H
miserliness N
, O
it O
also O
became O
the O
most O
critically O
acclaimed O
book O
of O
his O
career N
. O

The O
writing N
is O
simple O
, O
yet O
the O
individuals H
( O
especially O
the O
bourgeois O
title N
character A
) O
are O
dynamic O
and O
complex O
. O

Today N
the O
Maison O
De H
Balzac O
is O
one N
of O
Paris H
's H
three O
literary O
museums N
. O

Le O
Père O
Goriot O
( O
Old O
Father H
Goriot O
, O
1835 O
) O
was O
his O
next O
success N
, O
in O
which O
Balzac O
transposes O
the O
story N
of O
King H
Lear O
to O
1820 O
's H
Paris H
in O
order O
to O
rage O
at O
a O
society N
bereft O
of O
all O
love O
save O
the O
love O
of O
money N
. O

The O
centrality N
of O
a O
father H
in O
this O
novel N
matches O
Balzac O
's H
own O
position N
- O
not O
only O
as O
mentor H
to O
his O
troubled O
young O
secretary H
, O
Jules H
Sandeau O
, O
but O
also O
the O
fact N
that O
he O
had O
( O
most O
likely O
) O
fathered O
a O
child H
, O
Marie H
- O
Caroline H
, O
with O
his O
otherwise O
- O
married O
lover H
, O
Maria H
Du H
Fresnay O
. O

In O
1836 O
Balzac O
took O
the O
helm N
of O
the O
Chronique O
De H
Paris H
, O
a O
weekly O
magazine N
of O
society N
and O
politics N
. O

He O
tried O
to O
enforce O
strict O
impartiality N
in O
its O
pages N
and O
a O
reasoned O
assessment N
of O
various O
ideologies N
. O

As O
Rogers H
notes N
, O
" O
Balzac O
was O
interested O
in O
any O
social O
, O
political O
, O
or O
economic O
theory N
, O
whether O
from O
the O
right O
or O
the O
left O
. O

" O
The O
magazine N
failed O
, O
but O
in O
July O
1840 O
he O
founded O
another O
publication N
, O
the O
Revue N
Parisienne O
. O

It O
lasted O
for O
three O
issues N
. O

These O
dismal O
business N
efforts N
- O
and O
his O
misadventures N
in O
Sardinia O
- O
provided O
an O
appropriate O
milieu N
in O
which O
to O
set O
the O
two O
- O
volume N
Illusions O
Perdues O
( O
Lost O
Illusions O
, O
1843 O
) O
. O

The O
novel N
concerns O
Lucien H
De H
Rubempré O
, O
a O
young O
poet H
trying O
to O
make O
a O
name N
for O
himself O
, O
who O
becomes O
trapped O
in O
the O
morass N
of O
society N
's H
darkest O
contradictions N
. O

Lucien H
's H
journalism N
work N
is O
informed O
by O
Balzac O
's H
own O
failed O
ventures N
in O
the O
field N
. O

Splendeurs O
et O
misères O
des O
de O
les O
courtisanes O
( O
The O
Harlot O
High N
and O
Low N
, O
1847 O
) O
continues O
Lucien H
's H
story N
. O

He O
is O
trapped O
by O
the O
Abbé O
Herrera H
( O
Vautrin O
) O
in O
a O
convoluted O
and O
disastrous O
plan N
to O
regain O
social O
status N
. O

The O
book O
undergoes O
a O
massive O
temporal O
rift N
; O

the O
first O
part N
( O
of O
four O
) O
covers O
a O
span N
of O
six O
years N
, O
while O
the O
final O
two O
sections N
focus O
on O
just O
three O
days N
. O

The O
conniving O
and O
wrangling O
over O
wills N
and O
inheritances N
reflect O
the O
expertise N
gained O
by O
the O
author H
as O
a O
young O
law N
clerk H
. O

Balzac O
's H
health N
was O
deteriorating O
by O
this O
point N
, O
making O
the O
completion N
of O
this O
pair N
of O
books N
a O
significant O
accomplishment N
. O

Many O
of O
his O
novels N
were O
initially O
serialized O
, O
like O
those O
of O
Dickens H
. O

Illusions O
Perdues O
extends O
to O
a O
thousand O
pages N
after O
starting O
inauspiciously O
in O
a O
small O
- O
town N
print N
shop N
, O
whereas O
La O
Fille O
aux O
Yeux O
D' O
Or H
( O
the O
girl H
with O
the O
golden O
eyes N
, O
1835 O
) O
opens O
with O
a O
broad O
panorama N
of O
Paris H
but O
becomes O
a O
closely O
plotted O
novella N
of O
only O
fifty O
pages N
. O

He O
then O
rose O
and O
wrote O
for O
many O
hours N
, O
fueled O
by O
innumerable O
cups N
of O
black O
coffee N
. O

He O
would O
often O
work N
for O
fifteen O
hours N
or O
more O
at O
a O
stretch O
; O

he O
claimed O
to O
have O
once O
worked O
for O
48 O
hours N
with O
only O
three O
hours N
of O
rest N
in O
the O
middle O
. O

Balzac O
revised O
obsessively O
, O
covering O
printer H
's H
proofs N
with O
changes N
and O
additions N
to O
be O
reset O
. O

He O
sometimes O
repeated O
this O
process N
during O
the O
publication N
of O
a O
book O
, O
causing O
significant O
expense N
for O
both O
himself O
and O
the O
publisher N
. O

As O
a O
result N
, O
the O
finished O
product N
was O
frequently O
quite O
different O
from O
the O
original O
book O
. O

While O
some O
of O
his O
books N
never O
reached O
a O
finished O
state N
, O
some O
of O
those O
- O
such O
as O
Les H
employés O
( O
The O
Government O
Clerks H
, O
1841 O
) O
- O
are O
nonetheless O
noted O
by O
critics H
. O

He O
was O
friends H
with O
Théophile O
Gautier O
and O
Pierre H
- O
Marie H
- O
Charles H
De H
Bernard H
du O
Grail O
De H
La H
Villette O
, O
and O
he O
knew O
Victor H
Hugo H
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
he O
did O
not O
spend O
as O
much O
time N
in O
salons N
and O
clubs N
as O
did O
many O
of O
his O
characters A
. O

" O
In O
the O
first O
place N
he O
was O
too O
busy O
" O
, O
explains O
Saintsbury O
, O
" O
in O
the O
second H
he O
would O
not O
have O
been O
at O
home N
there O
.... O

He O
felt N
it O
was O
his O
business N
not O
to O
frequent O
society N
but O
to O
create O
it O
. O

" O
Nonetheless O
he O
often O
spent O
long O
periods N
at O
Château O
De H
Saché O
, O
near O
Tours O
, O
the O
home N
of O
his O
friend H
Jean H
De H
Margonne O
, O
his O
mother H
's H
lover H
and O
father H
to O
her O
youngest O
child H
. O

Many O
of O
Balzac O
's H
tormented O
characters A
were O
created O
in O
the O
small O
second H
- O
floor N
bedroom N
. O

Today N
the O
Château O
is O
a O
museum N
dedicated O
to O
the O
author H
's H
life N
. O

In O
February O
1832 O
Balzac O
received O
a O
letter N
from O
Odessa O
- O
lacking O
a O
return O
address N
and O
signed O
only O
by O
" O
L H
' O
Étrangère O
" O
( O
" O
The O
Foreigner H
" O
) O
- O
expressing O
sadness N
at O
the O
cynicism N
and O
atheism N
in O
La H
Peau O
De H
Chagrin O
and O
its O
negative O
portrayal N
of O
women H
. O

He O
responded O
by O
purchasing O
a O
classified O
advertisement N
in O
the O
Gazette N
De H
France O
, O
hoping O
that O
his O
anonymous O
critic H
would O
find O
it O
. O

Thus O
began O
a O
fifteen O
- O
year N
correspondence N
between O
Balzac O
and O
" O
the O
object N
of O
[ O
his O
] O
sweetest O
dreams N
" O
: O

Ewelina O
Hanska O
. O

Hanska O
was O
married O
to O
a O
man H
twenty O
years N
her O
senior H
, O
Waclaw O
Hanski O
, O
a O
wealthy O
Polish O
landowner H
living O
near O
Kiev O
. O

It O
had O
been O
a O
marriage N
of O
convenience N
to O
preserve O
her O
family H
's H
fortune N
. O

In O
Balzac O
Ewelina O
found O
a O
kindred O
spirit N
for O
her O
emotional O
and O
social O
desires N
, O
with O
the O
added O
benefit N
of O
feeling O
a O
connection N
to O
the O
glamorous O
capital N
of O
France O
. O

Robb O
says O
it O
is O
" O
like O
an O
experimental O
novel N
in O
which O
the O
female O
protagonist A
is O
always O
trying O
to O
pull O
in O
extraneous O
realities N
but O
which O
the O
hero H
is O
determined O
to O
keep O
on O
course N
, O
whatever O
tricks N
he O
has O
to O
use H
. O

" O
Waclaw O
Hanski O
died O
in O
1841 O
, O
and O
his O
widow H
and O
her O
admirer H
finally O
had O

himself O
on O

endured O
severe O
heart N

Although O
he O
married O
late O
in O
life N

Balzac O
had O
already O
written O
two O
treatises N
on O

: O

Physiologie O

In O

arrived O
in O
the O

capital N

Five O
months N
after O
his O
wedding N

on O
18 O
August O
, O
Balzac O
died O
. O

He O
had O
been O
visited O
that O
day N
by O
Victor H
Hugo H
, O
who O
later O
served O
as O
pallbearer H
and O
eulogist H
at O
Balzac O
's H
funeral N

Balzac O
was O
buried O
at O
the O
Cimetière O
du O
Père O
Lachaise O
in O
Paris H
. O

" O
Today N
" O
, O
said O
Hugo H
at O
the O
ceremony N
, O
" O
we H
have O
a O
people N
in O
black O
because O
of O
the O
death N
of O
the O
man H

talent N
; O

a O
nation N
in O
mourning N
for O
a O
man H

genius N

" O
The O
funeral N
was O
attended O
by O
" O
almost O
every O
writer H
in O
Paris H
" O
, O
including O
Frédérick O
Lemaître O
, O
Gustave O
Courbet O
, O

and O

Later O
, O
Balzac O
became O
the O
subject O
of O
a O
monumental O
statue N
by O
the O
French O
sculptor H
Auguste H
Rodin O
, O
which O
stands O
near O
the O
intersection N
of O
Boulevard O
Raspail O
and O
Boulevard O
Montparnasse O
. O

Rodin O
featured O
Balzac O
in O
several O
of O
his O
smaller O
sculptures N
as O
well O
. O

The O
Comédie O
Humaine O
remained O
unfinished O
at O
the O
time N
of O
his O
death N
- O
Balzac O
had O
plans N
to O
include O
numerous O
other O
books N
, O
most O
of O
which O
he O
never O
started O
. O

He O
frequently O
moved O
between O
works O
in O
progress N
, O
and O
" O
finished O
" O
works O
were O
often O
revised O
between O
editions N
. O

This O
piecemeal O
style N
is O
reflective O
of O
the O
author H
's H
own O
life N
, O
a O
possible O
attempt N
to O
stabilize O
it O
through O
fiction N

" O
The O

Pritchett O
, O
" O

construct O
a O

" O
Balzac O

extensive O
use H
of O
detail N
, O
especially O
the O
detail N
of O
objects N
, O
to O
illustrate O
the O
lives O
of O
his O
characters A
made O
him O
an O
early O
pioneer H
of O
literary O
realism N
. O

In O
the O
preface N
to O
the O
first O
edition N
of O
Scènes O
De H
La H
Vie O
Privée O
, O
he O
writes O
: O

For O
example N
, O
Balzac O
's H
friend H
Hyacinthe O
De H
Latouche O
had O
knowledge N
of O
hanging O
wallpaper N

Balzac O
transferred O
this O
to O

descriptions N

Goriot O
, O

of O
the O
identities N

those O
living O
inside O
. O

French O
novelist H
Émile O
Zola O
declared O
Balzac O
the O
father H
of O
the O
naturalist H
novel N
. O

Zola O
indicated O
that O
, O
whereas O
Romantics O
saw O
the O
world N
through O
a O
colored O
lens N
, O
the O
naturalist H
sees O
through O
a O
clear N
glass N
- O
precisely O
the O
sort N
of O
effect N
Balzac O
attempted O
to O
achieve O
in O
his O
works O
. O

" O
To H
arrive O
at O
the O
truth N
" O
, O
he O
wrote O
in O
the O
preface N
to O
Le O
Lys O
dans O
La H
Vallée O
, O
" O
writers H
use H
whatever O
literary O
device N
seems O
capable O
of O
giving O
the O
greatest O
intensity N
of O
life N
to O
their O
characters A
. O

" O
" O
Balzac O
's H
characters A
" O
, O
Robb O
notes N
, O
" O
were O
as O
real O
to O
him O
as O
if O
he O
were O
observing O
them O
in O
the O
outside O
world N
. O

" O
This O
reality N
was O
noted O
by O
playwright H
Oscar H
Wilde H
, O
who O
said O
: O

I H
remember O
it O
when O
I H
laugh O
. O

One O
critic H
explained O
that O
" O
there O
is O
a O
center N
and O
a O
circumference N
to O
Balzac O
's H
world N
. O

" O
Balzac O
's H
use H
of O
repeating N
characters A
, O
moving O
in O
and O
out H
of O
the O
Comédie O
's H
books N
, O
strengthens O
the O
realist H
representation N
. O

" O
When O
the O
characters A
reappear O
" O
, O
notes N
Rogers H
, O
" O
they O
do O
not O
step O
out H
of O
nowhere O
; O

they O
emerge O
from O
the O
privacy N
of O
their O
own O
lives O
which O
, O
for O
an O
interval N
, O
we H
have O
not O
been O
allowed O
to O
see O
. O

" O
He O
also O
used O
a O
realist H
technique N
which O
French O
novelist H
Marcel H
Proust O
later O
named O
" O
retrospective O
illumination N
" O
, O
whereby O
a O
character A
's H
past N
is O
revealed O
long O
after O
she O
or O
he O
first O
appears O
. O

A H
nearly O
infinite O
reserve O
of O
energy N
propels O
the O
characters A
in O
Balzac O
's H
novels N
. O

Struggling O
against O
the O
currents N
of O
human O
nature N
and O
society N
, O
they O
may O
lose O
more O
often O
than O
they O
win O
- O
but O
only O
rarely O
do O
they O
give O
up O
. O

Balzac O
spoke O
often O
of O
a O
" O
nervous O
and O
fluid O
force N
" O
between O
individuals H
, O
and O
Raphaël O
Valentin O
's H
decline N
in O
La H
Peau O
De H
Chagrin O
exemplifies O
the O
danger N
of O
withdrawing O
from O
the O
company N
of O
other O
people N
. O

Intricate O
details N
about O
locations N
sometimes O
stretch O
for O
fifteen O
or O
twenty O
pages N
. O

The O
influence N
of O
Paris H
permeates O
La H
Comédie O
. O

" O
His O
labyrinthine O
city N
provided O
a O
literary O
model N
used O
later O
by O
English O
novelist H
Charles H
Dickens H
and O
Russian O
author H
Fyodor O
Dostoevsky O
. O

The O
centrality N
of O
Paris H
in O
La H
Comédie O
Humaine O
is O
key N
to O
Balzac O
's H
legacy N
as O
a O
realist H
. O

" O
Realism O
is O
nothing N
if O
not O
urban O
" O
, O
notes N
critic H
Peter H
Brooks H
; O

the O
scene N
of O
a O
young O
man H
coming O
into O
the O
city N
to O
find O
his O
fortune N
is O
ubiquitous O
in O
the O
realist H
novel N
, O
and O
appears O
repeatedly O
in O
Balzac O
's H
works O
, O
such O
as O
Illusions O
Perdues O
. O

Balzac O
's H
literary O
mood N
evolved O
over O
time N
from O
one N
of O
despondency N
and O
chagrin N
to O
one N
of O
solidarity N
and O
courage N
- O
but O
not O
optimism N
. O

La H
Peau O
De H
Chagrin O
, O
among O
his O
earliest O
novels N
, O
is O
a O
pessimistic O
tale N
of O
confusion N
and O
destruction N
. O

But O
the O
cynicism N
declined O
as O
his O
oeuvre N
progressed O
, O
and O
the O
characters A
of O
Illusions O
Perdues O
reveal O
sympathy N
for O
those O
who O
are O
pushed O
to O
one N
side N
by O
society N
. O

Balzac O
concerned O
himself O
overwhelmingly O
with O
the O
darker O
essence N
of O
human O
nature N
and O
the O
corrupting O
influence N
of O
middle O
and O
high O
societies N
. O

He O
worked O
to O
observe O
humanity N
in O
its O
most O
representative O
state N
, O
frequently O
passing O
incognito O
among O
the O
masses N
of O
Parisian O
society N
to O
do O
research N
. O

He O
used O
incidents N
from O
his O
life N
and O
the O
people N
around O
him O
, O
in O
works O
like O
Eugénie O
Grandet O
and O
Louis H
Lambert H
. O

Balzac O
was O
a O
highly O
conservative O
Royalist H
; O

in O
many O
ways N
, O
he O
is O
the O
antipode N
to O
Victor H
Hugo H
's H
democratic O
republicanism N
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
his O
keen O
insight N
regarding O
working-class O
conditions N
earned O
him O
the O
esteem N
of O
many O
Socialists H
and O
Marxists H
. O

Engels O
said O
that O
Balzac O
was O
his O
favorite O
writer H
. O

Marx H
's H
work N
Das O
Kapital O
also O
makes O
constant O
reference N
to O
the O
works O
of O
Balzac O
and O
urged O
Engels O
to O
read O
Balzac O
's H
work N
The O
Unknown O
Masterpiece N
. O

Balzac O
influenced O
the O
writers H
of O
his O
time N
and O
beyond O
. O

He O
has O
been O
compared O
to O
Charles H
Dickens H
and O
has O
been O
called O
one N
of O
Dickens H
' O
influences N
. O

Critic H
W. O
H. O
Helm O
calls O
one N
" O
the O
French O
Dickens H
" O
and O
the O
other O
" O
the O
English O
Balzac O
" O
. O

Critic H
Richard H
Lehan O
says O
that O
" O
Balzac O
was O
the O
bridge N
between O
the O
comic O
realism N
of O
Dickens H
and O
the O
naturalism N
of O
Zola O
. O
" O

Gustave O
Flaubert O
was O
also O
substantially O
influenced O
by O
Balzac O
. O

Praising O
his O
portrayal N
of O
society N
while O
attacking O
his O
prose N
style N
, O
Flaubert O
once O
wrote O
: O

" O
What O
a O
man H
he O
would O
have O
been O
had O
he O
known O
how O
to O
write O
! O

" O
While O
he O
disdained O
the O
label N
of O
" O
realist H
" O
, O
Flaubert O
clearly O
took O
heed N
of O
Balzac O
's H
close O
attention N
to O
detail N
and O
unvarnished O
depictions N
of O
bourgeois O
life N
. O

This O
influence N
shows N
in O
Flaubert O
's H
work N
L H
' O
education N
sentimentale O
, O
which O
owes O
a O
debt N
to O
Balzac O

Illusions O
Perdues O
. O

" O
What O
Balzac O
started O
" O
, O
says O
Lehan O
, O
" O
Flaubert O
helped O
finish O
. O

" O
Marcel H
Proust O
similarly O
learned O
from O
the O
Realist H
example N
; O

he O
adored O
Balzac O
and O
studied O
his O
works O
carefully O
, O
although O
he O
criticised O
what O
he O
called O
Balzac O
's H
" O
vulgarity N

" O

story N

) O
, O
in O
which O
minute O
details N

followed O
by O
deep O
personal O
reflections N

a O
clear N
ancestor H
of O
the O
style N
which O
Proust O
used O
in O
A H

However O
, O
Proust O
wrote O

in O
life N
that O

higher O
than O

" O
Perhaps O
the O
author H
most O
affected O
by O
Balzac O
was O
American O
expatriate O
novelist H
Henry H
James H

In O
1878 O
James H
wrote O
with O
sadness N

the O
lack N

contemporary O
attention N

to O

essays N

in O

1877 O
, O
1902 O
, O
and O

) O
. O

In O
1878 O
James H
wrote O
: O

" O
Large O
as O
Balzac O

, O
he O
is O
all O
of O
one N
piece N

" O
He O
wrote O
with O
admiration N

portray O

" O
a O
beast A

" O
In O

of O

sweep N

by O
Balzac O
- O

" O
Still O
, O
both O

early O
plays N

mainly O
comedies N

raised O
to O
the O
peak N
of O
sophistication N

artistry N
by O
the O
end N
of O
the O
16 O

He O
then O
wrote O
mainly O
tragedies N

about O
1608 O
, O
including O
Hamlet O
, O
King H
Lear O
, O
Othello O
, O
and O
Macbeth O
, O
considered O
some O
of O
the O
finest O
works O
in O
the O
English O
language N

In O
his O

phase N

he O
wrote O
tragicomedies N

also O
known O
as O
romances N

and O
collaborated O
with O
other O

Many O
of O
his O

In O

, O
John H

Henry H
Condell O
, O
two O

dramatic O
works O
that O
included O
all O

two O
of O
the O
plays N
now O
recognised O
as O
Shakespeare H

. O

It O
was O
prefaced O
with O
a O
poem N
by O
Ben H
Jonson O
, O
in O
which O
Shakespeare H
is O
hailed O
, O
presciently O
, O
as O
" O
not O

for O

The O
Romantics O
, O
in O

, O
acclaimed O
Shakespeare H

and O
the O
Victorians H
worshipped O
Shakespeare H
with O
a O
reverence N
that O
George H
Bernard H
Shaw H
called O
" O
bardolatry N

In O

William H
Shakespeare H
was O
the O
son H
of O
John H
Shakespeare H
, O
an O
alderman H
and O
a O
successful O
glover O
originally O
from O
Snitterfield O
, O
and O
Mary H
Arden O
, O
the O

He O
was O
born O
in O
Stratford O
- O
upon O
- O
Avon O
and O
baptised O
there O
on O
26 O
April O
1564 O

This O
date N
, O
which O
can O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
an O
18 O
th O
- O
century N
scholar H

mistake N
, O
has O
proved O
appealing O
to O
biographers H
, O
since O
Shakespeare H
died O
23 O
April O
1616 O
. O

He O
was O
the O
third O
child H
of O
eight O
and O
the O
eldest O
surviving O
son H
. O

Although O
no O
attendance N
records N
for O
the O
period N
survive O
, O
most O
biographers H
agree O
that O
Shakespeare H
was O
probably O
educated O
at O
the O
King H
's H
New H
School N
in O
Stratford O
, O
a O
free O
school N
chartered O
in O
1553 O
, O
about O
a O
quarter N
- O
mile N
from O
his O
home N

Grammar N
schools N
varied O
in O
quality N
during O
the O
Elizabethan O
era N
, O
but O
grammar N
school N
curricula N
were O
largely O
similar O
, O
the O
basic O
Latin O
text N
was O
standardised O
by O
royal O
decree N
, O
and O
the O
school N
would O
have O
provided O
an O
intensive O
education N
in O
grammar N
based O
upon O
Latin O
classical O
authors H
. O

John H
Shakespeare H

house N
, O
believed O
to O
be O
Shakespeare H

birthplace N

in O
Stratford O

At O
the O
age N

18 O
, O
Shakespeare H
married O
the O
26 O

old O
Anne H
Hathaway O

The O
consistory O
court N
of O
the O
Diocese N

issued O
a O

27 O

The O
next O
day N
, O
two O
of O
Hathaway O

neighbours H
posted O
bonds N

that O
no O
lawful O

the O
marriage N

The O
ceremony N
may O
have O
been O
arranged O
in O
some O
haste N
, O
since O
the O
Worcester O
chancellor H
allowed O
the O
marriage N

to O
be O
read O
once O
instead O
of O
the O
usual O
three O

Anne H

almost O
two O
years N

Hamnet O
died O

unknown O
causes N
at O
the O
age N

was O
buried O
11 O
August O

After O
the O
birth N
of O
the O
twins H
, O
Shakespeare H
left O
few O
historical O
traces N
until O
he O
is O
mentioned O
as O
part N
of O
the O
London O
theatre N
scene N
in O
1592 O
. O

The O
exception N

the O
appearance N

Scholars H
refer O

the O
years N

" O

Biographers H
attempting O
to O
account O
for O
this O
period N
have O
reported O
many O
apocryphal O
stories N
. O

Nicholas H
Rowe H
, O
Shakespeare H
's H
first O
biographer H
, O
recounted O
a O
Stratford O
legend N
that O
Shakespeare H
fled O
the O
town N

London O
to O
escape O
prosecution N
for O
deer A
poaching N
in O
the O
estate N
of O
local O
squire H
Thomas H
Lucy H
. O

Shakespeare H
is O
also O
supposed O
to O
have O
taken O
his O
revenge N
on O
Lucy H
by O
writing N
a O
scurrilous O
ballad N
about O
him O
. O

Another O
18 O

story N

Shakespeare H
starting O
his O
theatrical O
career N
minding O
the O
horses A
of O
theatre N
patrons H
in O
London O
. O

John H
Aubrey H
reported O
that O
Shakespeare H
had O
been O
a O
country N
schoolmaster H
. O

Some O
20 O
th O
- O
century N
scholars H
have O
suggested O
that O
Shakespeare H
may O
have O
been O
employed O
as O
a O
schoolmaster H
by O
Alexander H
Hoghton O
of O
Lancashire O
, O
a O
Catholic H
landowner H
who O
named O
a O
certain O
" O
William H
Shakeshafte O
" O
in O
his O
will O
. O

Little H
evidence N
substantiates O
such O
stories N
other O
than O
hearsay O
collected O
after O
his O
death N
, O
and O
Shakeshafte O
was O
a O
common O
name N
in O
the O
Lancashire O
area N
. O

By O
then O
, O
he O
was O
sufficiently O
well O
known O
in O
London O
to O
be O
attacked O
in O
print N
by O
the O
playwright H
Robert H
Greene H
in O
his O
Groats N

Worth O

: O

Scholars H
differ O
on O
the O
exact O
meaning N
of O
these O
words N
, O
but O
most O
agree O
that O
Greene H
is O
accusing O
Shakespeare H
of O
reaching O
above O
his O
rank N
in O
trying O
to O
match O
university N

such O
as O

attack N
is O
the O
earliest O
surviving O
mention N
of O
Shakespeare H
's H
career N
in O
the O
theatre N

Biographers H
suggest O
that O
his O
career N
may O
have O
begun O
any O
time N
from O
the O
mid-1580s O
to O
just O
before O
Greene H
's H
remarks N

From O
1594 O
, O
Shakespeare H
's H
plays N
were O
performed O
by O
only O
the O
Lord H
Chamberlain H

Men H
, O
a O
company N

by O
a O
group N
of O
players H
, O
including O
Shakespeare H
, O
that O
soon O
became O
the O
leading N

company N

London O

After O
the O
death N
of O
Queen O
Elizabeth H
in O
1603 O
, O
the O
company N
was O
awarded O
a O
royal O
patent O
by O
the O
new O
king H
, O
James H
I H
, O
and O
changed O
its O
name N

the O
King H

In O

Some O
of O

published O
in O
quarto N

By O
1598 O

his O
name N
had O
become O
a O
selling O
point N

began O
to O

The O

is O
taken O
by O
some O
scholars H
as O
a O
sign N

his O

nearing O
its O
end N

The O
First O
Folio N

1623 O
, O
however O
, O
lists O
Shakespeare H
as O
one N
of O
" O
the O
Principal O

in O
all O
these O
Plays N
" O
, O
some O
of O

Volpone O
, O
although O
we H
cannot O
can O
not O
know O
for O
certain O
which O
roles N

played O

In O
1610 O
, O
John H
Davies H
of O
Hereford O
wrote O
that O
" O
good O
Will H
" O
played O
" O
kingly O
" O
roles N
. O

In O
1709 O
, O
Rowe H
passed O
down O
a O
tradition N
that O
Shakespeare H
played O
the O
ghost H
of O
Hamlet H
's H
father H
. O

Later O
traditions N
maintain O
that O
he O
also O
played O
Adam H
in O
As O
You H
Like O
It O
and O
the O
Chorus N
in O
Henry H
V N
, O
though O
scholars H
doubt O
the O
sources N

the O
information N

Shakespeare H
divided O
his O
time N

London O
and O
Stratford O
during O
his O
career N

He O
moved O
across O
the O
river N
to O
Southwark O
by O
1599 O
, O
the O
year N
his O
company N
constructed O
the O
Globe N

Rowe H
was O
the O
first O
biographer H
to O
record N
the O
tradition N

repeated O
by O
Johnson H
, O
that O
Shakespeare H
retired O
to O
Stratford O
' O
some O
years N
before O
his O
death N

. O

He O
was O
still O
working O

an O
actor H
in O
London O
in O

; O

in O
an O
answer N
to O
the O
sharers H

1635 O
Cuthbert H
Burbage O
stated O
that O

from O
Henry H

In O
a O
document N

7 O
June O
1609 O
in O
a O
lawsuit N
he O
brought O
in O
Stratford O
against O
John H
Addenbrooke O

Shakespeare H

described O

at O

. O

However O
it O
is O
perhaps O
relevant O
that O
the O
bubonic O
plague N
raged O
in O
London O
throughout O
1609 O
. O

The O
London O
public O
playhouses N
were O
repeatedly O
closed O
during O
extended O
outbreaks N

the O
plague N
( O
a O
total N

over O
60 O
months N
closure N
between O
May O
1603 O
and O
February O
1610 O
) O
, O
which O
meant O
there O
was O
often O
no O
acting N
work N
. O

Retirement N
from O
all O
work N
was O
uncommon O
at O
that O
time N

Shakespeare H
continued O
to O
visit O
London O
during O
the O
years N
1611 O
– O
1614 O
. O

In O
March O
1613 O
he O
bought O
a O
gatehouse N
in O
the O
former O
Blackfriars O
priory N
; O

and O
from O
November O
1614 O
he O
was O
in O
London O
for O
several O
weeks N
with O
his O
son-in-law H
, O
John H
Hall H
. O

After O
1610 O
, O
Shakespeare H
wrote O
fewer O
plays N
, O
and O
none N
are O
attributed O
to O
him O
after O
1613 O
. O

Shakespeare H
died O
on O
23 O
April O
1616 O
and O
was O
survived O
by O
his O
wife H
and O
two O
daughters H
. O

Susanna O
had O
married O
a O
physician H
, O
John H
Hall H
, O
in O
1607 O
, O
and O
Judith H
had O
married O
Thomas H
Quiney O
, O
a O
vintner H
, O
two O
months N
before O
Shakespeare H
's H
death N
. O

Shakespeare H
signed O
his O
last O
will O
and O
testament N
on O
25 O
March O
1616 O
; O

the O
following O
day N
his O
new O
son-in-law H
, O
Thomas H
Quiney O
was O
found O
guilty O
of O
fathering O
an O
illegitimate O
son H
by O
Margaret H
Wheeler H
, O
who O
had O
died O
during O
childbirth N
. O

Thomas H
was O
ordered O
by O
the O
church N
court N
to O
do O
public O
penance N
which O
would O
have O
caused O
much O
shame N
and O
embarrassment N
for O
the O
Shakespeare H
family H
. O

In O
his O
will O
, O
Shakespeare H
left O
the O
bulk N
of O
his O
large O
estate N
to O
his O
elder H
daughter H
Susanna O
. O

The O
terms N
instructed O
that O
she O
pass O
it O
down O
intact O
to O
" O
the O
first O
son H
of O
her O
body N
" O
. O

The O
Quineys O
had O
three O
children H
, O
all O
of O
whom O
died O
without O
marrying O
. O

The O
Halls O
had O
one N
child H
, O
Elizabeth H
, O
who O
married O
twice O
but O
died O
without O
children H
in O
1670 O
, O
ending O
Shakespeare H
's H
direct O
line N
. O

Shakespeare H
's H
will O
scarcely O
mentions O
his O
wife H
, O
Anne H
, O
who O
was O
probably O
entitled O
to O
one N
third O
of O
his O
estate N
automatically O
. O

He O
did O
make O
a O
point N
, O
however O
, O
of O
leaving O
her O
" O
my H
second H
best O
bed N
" O
, O
a O
bequest N
that O
has O
led O
to O
much O
speculation N
. O

Some O
scholars H
see O
the O
bequest N
as O
an O
insult N
to O
Anne H
, O
whereas O
others O
believe O
that O
the O
second-best O
bed N
would O
have O
been O
the O
matrimonial O
bed N

Sometime O
before O
1623 O
, O
a O
funerary O
monument N

erected O
in O
his O
memory N

the O
north O
wall N

with O
a O
half O

Shakespeare H
has O
been O
commemorated O
in O
many O
statues N

world N

funeral N
monuments N

Most O
playwrights H
of O
the O
period N
typically O
collaborated O
with O
others O
at O
some O
point N
, O
and O
critics H
agree O
that O
Shakespeare H
did O
the O
same O
, O
mostly O
early O
and O
late O
in O
his O
career N
. O

Some O
attributions N
, O
such O
as O
Titus O
Andronicus O
and O
the O
early O
history N
plays N
, O
remain O
controversial O
, O
while O
The O
Two O
Noble H
Kinsmen H
and O
the O
lost O
Cardenio O
have O
well O
- O
attested O
contemporary O
documentation N
. O

Textual O
evidence N
also O
supports O
the O
view N
that O
several O
of O
the O
plays N
were O
revised O
by O
other O
writers H
after O
their O
original O
composition N
. O

The O
first O
recorded O
works O
of O
Shakespeare H
are O
Richard H
III O
and O
the O
three O
parts N
of O
Henry H
VI O
, O
written O
in O
the O
early O
1590 O
s H
during O
a O
vogue N
for O
historical O
drama N
. O

Shakespeare H
's H
plays N
are O
difficult O
to O
date N
, O
however O
, O
and O
studies N
of O
the O
texts N
suggest O
that O
Titus O
Andronicus O
, O
The O
Comedy N
of O
Errors O
, O
The O
Taming O
of O
the O
Shrew H
and O
The O
Two O
Gentlemen O
of O
Verona O
may O
also O
belong O
to O
Shakespeare H
's H
earliest O
period N
. O

His O
first O
histories N

which O
draw O
heavily O
on O
the O
1587 O
edition N
of O
Raphael H
Holinshed O

Chronicles N

England O
, O
Scotland O
, O
and O
Ireland O
, O
dramatise O
the O
destructive O
results N
of O
weak O
or O
corrupt O
rule N
and O
have O
been O
interpreted O
as O
a O
justification N
for O
the O
origins N
of O
the O
Tudor O
dynasty H
. O

The O
early O
plays N
were O
influenced O
by O
the O
works O
of O
other O
Elizabethan O
dramatists H
, O
especially O
Thomas H
Kyd O
and O
Christopher H
Marlowe O
, O
by O
the O
traditions N
of O
medieval O
drama N
, O
and O
by O
the O
plays N
of O
Seneca H
. O

The O
Comedy N
of O
Errors O
was O
also O
based O
on O
classical O
models N
, O
but O
no O
source N
for O
The O
Taming O
of O
the O
Shrew H
has O
been O
found O
, O
though O
it O
is O
related O
to O
a O
separate O
play O
of O
the O
same O
name N
and O
may O
have O
derived O
from O
a O
folk N
story N
. O

Like O
The O
Two O
Gentlemen O

Verona O
, O
in O
which O
two O
friends H

to O

the O
taming O

a O

modern O
critics H

Shakespeare H
's H
early O
classical O
and O
Italianate O
comedies N
, O
containing O
tight O
double O
plots N
and O
precise O
comic O
sequences N
, O
give O
way N
in O
the O
Mid-1590s O
to O
the O
romantic O
atmosphere N
of O
his O
greatest O
comedies N
. O

A H
Midsummer N

Dream N
is O
a O
witty O
mixture N
of O
romance O
, O
fairy O
magic N

and O
comic O
lowlife H
scenes N
. O

Shakespeare H
's H
next O
comedy N
, O
the O
equally O
romantic O
Merchant O
of O
Venice O
, O
contains O
a O
portrayal N
of O
the O
vengeful O
Jewish O
moneylender H
Shylock O
, O
which O
reflects O
Elizabethan O
views N
but O
may O
appear O
derogatory O
to O
modern O
audiences N
. O

The O
wit N

the O

and O
the O
lively O
merrymaking N
of O

complete O
Shakespeare H
's H
sequence N
of O
great O
comedies N
. O

This O
period N
begins O
and O
ends O
with O
two O
tragedies N
: O

Romeo H
and O
Juliet O
, O
the O
famous O
romantic O
tragedy N
of O
sexually O
charged O
adolescence N
, O
love O
, O
and O
death N
; O

and O
Julius O
Caesar H
— O
based O
on O
Sir O
Thomas H
North H
's H
1579 O
translation N
of O
Plutarch O
's H
Parallel O
Lives N
— O
which O
introduced O
a O
new O
kind N
of O
drama N
. O

According O
to O
Shakespearean O
scholar H
James H
Shapiro H
, O
in O
Julius O
Caesar H
" O
the O
various O
strands N
of O
politics N
, O
character A
, O
inwardness N
, O
contemporary O
events N
, O
even O
Shakespeare H
's H
own O
reflections N
on O
the O
act N
of O
writing N
, O
began O
to O
infuse O
each O
other O
" O
. O

In O
the O
early O
17 O
th O
century N
, O
Shakespeare H
wrote O
the O
so-called O
" O
problem N
plays N
" O
Measure N
for O
Measure N
, O
Troilus O
and O
Cressida O
, O
and O
All O
's H
Well O
That O
Ends O
Well O
and O
a O
number N
of O
his O
best O
known O
tragedies N
. O

Many O
critics H
believe O
that O
Shakespeare H
's H
greatest O
tragedies N
represent O
the O
peak N
of O
his O
art N
. O

The O
titular O
hero H
of O
one N
of O
Shakespeare H
's H
most O
famous O
tragedies N
, O
Hamlet H
, O
has O
probably O
been O
discussed O
more O
than O
any O
other O
Shakespearean O
character A
, O
especially O
for O
his O
famous O
soliloquy N
which O
begins O
" O
To H
be O
or O
not O
to O
be O
; O

Unlike O
the O
introverted O
Hamlet H
, O
whose O
fatal O
flaw N
is O
hesitation N
, O
the O
heroes N
of O
the O
tragedies N
that O
followed O
, O
Othello O
and O
King H
Lear O
, O
are O
undone O
by O
hasty O
errors N
of O
judgement N
. O

The O
plots N
of O
Shakespeare H
's H
tragedies N
often O
hinge O
on O
such O
fatal O
errors N
or O
flaws N
, O
which O
overturn O
order O
and O
destroy O
the O
hero H
and O
those O
he O
loves O
. O

In O
Othello O
, O
the O
villain N
Iago O
stokes O
Othello O
's H
sexual O
jealousy N
to O
the O
point N
where O
he O
murders O
the O
innocent O
wife H
who O
loves O
him O
. O

In O
King H
Lear O
, O
the O
old O
king H
commits O
the O
tragic O
error N
of O
giving O
up O
his O
powers N
, O
initiating O
the O
events N
which O
lead O
to O
the O
torture N
and O
blinding O
of O
the O
Earl H
of O
Gloucester O
and O
the O
murder O
of O
Lear O
's H
youngest O
daughter H
Cordelia O
. O

According O
to O
the O
critic H
Frank H
Kermode O
, O
" O
the O
play O
- O
offers O
neither O
its O
good O
characters A
nor O
its O
audience N
any O
relief N
from O
its O
cruelty N
" O
. O

In O
Macbeth O
, O
the O
shortest O
and O
most O
compressed O
of O
Shakespeare H
's H
tragedies N
, O
uncontrollable O
ambition N
incites O
Macbeth O
and O
his O
wife H
, O
Lady H
Macbeth O
, O
to O
murder O
the O
rightful O
king H
and O
usurp O
the O
throne N
, O
until O
their O
own O
guilt N
destroys O
them O
in O
turn O
. O

In O
this O
play O
, O
Shakespeare H
adds O
a O
supernatural O
element N
to O
the O
tragic O
structure N
. O

His O
last O
major O
tragedies N
, O
Antony H
and O
Cleopatra H
and O
Coriolanus O
, O
contain O
some O
of O
Shakespeare H
's H
finest O
poetry N
and O
were O
considered O
his O
most O
successful O
tragedies N
by O
the O
poet H
and O
critic H
T. O
S. O
Eliot H
. O

In O
his O
final O
period N
, O
Shakespeare H
turned O
to O
romance O
or O
tragicomedy N
and O
completed O
three O
more O
major O
plays N
: O

Cymbeline O
, O
The O
Winter H
's H
Tale H
and O
The O
Tempest N
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
collaboration N
, O
Pericles O
, O
Prince H
of O
Tyre O
. O

Less O
bleak O
than O
the O
tragedies N
, O
these O
four O
plays N
are O
graver N
in O
tone N
than O
the O
comedies N
of O
the O
1590 O
s H
, O
but O
they O
end N
with O
reconciliation N
and O
the O
forgiveness N
of O
potentially O
tragic O
errors N
. O

Some O
commentators H
have O
seen O
this O
change O
in O
mood N
as O
evidence N
of O
a O
more O
serene O
view N
of O
life N
on O
Shakespeare H
's H
part N
, O
but O
it O
may O
merely O
reflect O
the O
theatrical O
fashion N
of O
the O
day N
. O

It O
is O
not O
clear N
for O
which O
companies N
Shakespeare H
wrote O
his O
early O
plays N
. O

The O
title N
page N
of O
the O
1594 O
edition N
of O
Titus O
Andronicus O
reveals O
that O
the O
play O
had O
been O
acted O
by O
three O
different O
troupes N
. O

After O
the O
plagues N
of O
1592 O
– O
3 O
, O
Shakespeare H
's H
plays N
were O
performed O
by O
his O
own O
company N
at O
The O
Theatre N
and O
the O
Curtain N
in O
Shoreditch O
, O
north O
of O
the O
Thames O
. O

Londoners O
flocked O
there O
to O
see O
the O
first O
part N
of O
Henry H
IV O
, O
Leonard H
Digges O
recording O
, O
" O
Let O
but O
Falstaff O
come O
, O
Hal H
, O
Poins O
, O
the O
rest N
... O
and O
you H
scarce O
shall O
have O
a O
room N
" O
. O

When O
the O
company N
found O
themselves O
in O
dispute N
with O
their O
landlord H
, O
they O
pulled O
The O
Theatre N
down O
and O
used O
the O
timbers N
to O
construct O
the O
Globe N
Theatre N
, O
the O
first O
playhouse N
built O
by O
actors H
for O
actors H
, O
on O
the O
south O
bank N
of O
the O
Thames O
at O
Southwark O
. O

The O
Globe N
opened O
in O
autumn N
1599 O
, O
with O
Julius H
Caesar H
one N
of O
the O
first O
plays N
staged O
. O

Most O
of O
Shakespeare H
's H
greatest O
post-1599 O
plays N
were O
written O
for O
the O
Globe N
, O
including O
Hamlet H
, O
Othello O
and O
King H
Lear O
. O

After O
the O
Lord H
Chamberlain H
's H
Men H
were O
renamed O
the O
King H
's H
Men H
in O
1603 O
, O
they O
entered O
a O
special O
relationship N
with O
the O
new O
King H
James H
. O

Although O
the O
performance N
records N
are O
patchy O
, O
the O
King H
's H
Men H
performed O
seven O
of O
Shakespeare H
's H
plays N
at O
court N
between O
1 O
November O
1604 O
and O
31 O
October O
1605 O
, O
including O
two O
performances N
of O
The O
Merchant O
of O
Venice O
. O

After O
1608 O
, O
they O
performed O
at O
the O
indoor O
Blackfriars O
Theatre N
during O
the O
winter N
and O
the O
Globe N
during O
the O
summer N
. O

The O
indoor O
setting N
, O
combined O
with O
the O
Jacobean O
fashion N
for O
lavishly O
staged O
masques N
, O
allowed O
Shakespeare H
to O
introduce O
more O
elaborate O
stage N
devices N
. O

The O
actors H
in O
Shakespeare H
's H
company N
included O
the O
famous O
Richard H
Burbage O
, O
William H
Kempe O
, O
Henry H
Condell O
and O
John H
Heminges O
. O

Burbage O
played O
the O
leading N
role N
in O
the O
first O
performances N
of O
many O
of O
Shakespeare H
's H
plays N
, O
including O
Richard H
III O
, O
Hamlet H
, O
Othello O
, O
and O
King H
Lear O
. O

The O
popular O
comic O
actor H
Will H
Kempe O
played O
the O
servant H
Peter H
in O
Romeo H
and O
Juliet O
and O
Dogberry O
in O
Much O

About O
Nothing N
, O
among O
other O
characters A
. O

He O
was O
replaced O
around O
the O
turn O
of O
the O
16 O
th O
century N
by O
Robert H
Armin O
, O
who O
played O
roles N
such O
as O
Touchstone O
in O
As O
You H
Like O
It O
and O
the O
fool H
in O
King H
Lear O
. O

On O
29 O
June O
, O
however O
, O
a O
cannon N
set O
fire N
to O
the O
thatch N
of O
the O
Globe N
and O
burned O
the O
theatre N
to O
the O
ground N
, O
an O
event N
which O
pinpoints O
the O
date N
of O
a O
Shakespeare H
play O
with O
rare O
precision N
. O

In O
1623 O
, O
John H
Heminges O
and O
Henry H
Condell O
, O
two O
of O
Shakespeare H
's H
friends H
from O
the O
King H
's H
Men H
, O
published O
the O
First O
Folio N
, O
a O
collected O
edition N
of O
Shakespeare H
's H
plays N
. O

Many O
of O
the O
plays N
had O
already O
appeared O
in O
quarto N
versions N
— O
flimsy O
books N
made O
from O
sheets N
of O
paper N
folded O
twice O
to O
make O
four O
leaves N
. O

No O
evidence N
suggests O
that O
Shakespeare H
approved O
these O
editions N
, O
which O
the O
First O
Folio N
describes O
as O
" O
stol'n O
and O
surreptitious O
copies N
" O
. O

Alfred H
Pollard O
termed O
some O
of O
them O
" O
bad O
quartos N
" O
because O
of O
their O
adapted O
, O
paraphrased O
or O
garbled O
texts N
, O
which O
may O
in O
places N
have O
been O
reconstructed O
from O
memory N
. O

Where O
several O
versions N
of O
a O
play O
survive O
, O
each O
differs O
from O
the O
other O
. O

The O
differences N
may O
stem O
from O
copying O
or O
printing O
errors N
, O
from O
notes N
by O
actors H
or O
audience N
members H
, O
or O
from O
Shakespeare H
's H
own O
papers N
. O

In O
some O
cases N
, O
for O
example N
Hamlet H
, O
Troilus O
and O
Cressida O
and O
Othello O
, O
Shakespeare H
could O
have O
revised O
the O
texts N
between O
the O
quarto N
and O
folio N
editions N
. O

In O
the O
case N
of O
King H
Lear O
, O
however O
, O
while O
most O
modern O
editions N
do O
conflate O
them O
, O
the O
1623 O
folio N
version N
is O
so O
different O
from O
the O
1608 O
quarto N
, O
that O
the O
Oxford O
Shakespeare H
prints O
them O
both O
, O
arguing O
that O
they O
cannot O
can O
not O
be O
conflated O
without O
confusion N
. O

In O
1593 O
and O
1594 O
, O
when O
the O
theatres N
were O
closed O
because O
of O
plague N
, O
Shakespeare H
published O
two O
narrative N
poems N
on O
erotic O
themes N
, O
Venus O
and O
Adonis O
and O
The O
Rape N
of O
Lucrece O
. O

In O
Venus O
and O
Adonis O
, O
an O
innocent O
Adonis O
rejects O
the O
sexual O
advances N

Venus O
; O

while O
in O
The O
Rape N

Lucrece O
, O
the O
virtuous O
wife H
Lucrece O

by O
the O
lustful O
Tarquin O

Influenced O
by O
Ovid H

Metamorphoses N
, O
the O
poems N
show O
the O
guilt N
and O
moral O
confusion N
that O
result N
from O
uncontrolled O
lust N

Both O
proved O
popular O

Most O
scholars H
now O
accept O
that O
Shakespeare H

A H
Lover H

when O
each O
of O
the O
154 O
sonnets N
was O
composed O
, O
but O
evidence N
suggests O
that O
Shakespeare H
wrote O
sonnets N
throughout O
his O
career N
for O
a O
private O
readership N
. O

Even O
before O
the O
two O
unauthorised O
sonnets N
appeared O
in O
The O
Passionate O
Pilgrim H
in O
1599 O
, O
Francis H
Meres O
had O
referred O
in O
1598 O
to O
Shakespeare H
's H
" O
sugred O
Sonnets N
among O
his O
private O
friends H
" O
. O

Few O
analysts H
believe O
that O
the O
published O
collection N
follows O
Shakespeare H
's H
intended O
sequence N
. O

He O
seems O
to O
have O
planned O
two O
contrasting O
series N
: O

one N
about O
uncontrollable O
lust N
for O
a O
married O
woman H
of O
dark O
complexion N
( O
the O
" O
dark O
lady H
" O
) O
, O
and O
one N
about O
conflicted O
love O
for O
a O
fair O
young O
man H
( O
the O
" O
fair O
youth H
" O
) O
. O

It O
remains O
unclear O
if O
these O
figures N
represent O
real O
individuals H
, O
or O
if O
the O
authorial O
" O
I H
" O
who O
addresses O
them O
represents O
Shakespeare H
himself O
, O
though O
Wordsworth O
believed O
that O
with O
the O
sonnets N
" O
Shakespeare H
unlocked O
his O
heart N
" O
. O

The O
1609 O
edition N
was O
dedicated O
to O
a O
" O
Mr. N
W.H. O
" O
, O
credited O
as O
" O
the O
only O
begetter H
" O
of O
the O
poems N
. O

Critics H
praise N
the O
Sonnets N
as O
a O
profound O
meditation N
on O
the O
nature N
of O
love O
, O
sexual O
passion N
, O
procreation N
, O
death N
, O
and O
time N
. O

Shakespeare H
's H
first O
plays N
were O
written O
in O
the O
conventional O
style N
of O
the O
day N
. O

He O
wrote O
them O
in O
a O
stylised O
language N
that O
does O
not O
always O
spring N
naturally O
from O
the O
needs N
of O
the O
characters A
or O
the O
drama N
. O

The O
poetry N
depends O
on O
extended O
, O
sometimes O
elaborate O
metaphors N
and O
conceits N
, O
and O
the O
language N
is O
often O
rhetorical O
— O
written O
for O
actors H
to O
declaim O
rather O
than O
speak O
. O

The O
grand O
speeches N
in O
Titus O
Andronicus O
, O
in O
the O
view N
of O
some O
critics H
, O
often O
hold O
up O
the O
action N
, O
for O
example N
; O

and O
the O
verse N
in O
The O
Two O
Gentlemen O
of O
Verona O
has O
been O
described O
as O
stilted O
. O

Soon O
, O
however O
, O
Shakespeare H
began O
to O
adapt O
the O
traditional O
styles N
to O
his O
own O
purposes N
. O

The O
opening N
soliloquy N
of O
Richard H
III O
has O
its O
roots N
in O
the O
self O
- O
declaration N
of O
Vice N
in O
medieval O
drama N
. O

At O
the O
same O
time N
, O
Richard H
's H
vivid O
self O
- O
awareness N
looks O
forward O
to O
the O
soliloquies N
of O
Shakespeare H
's H
mature O
plays N
. O

No O
single O
play O
marks O
a O
change O
from O
the O
traditional O
to O
the O
freer O
style N
. O

Shakespeare H
combined O
the O
two O
throughout O
his O
career N
, O
with O
Romeo H
and O
Juliet O
perhaps O
the O
best O
example N
of O
the O
mixing O
of O
the O
styles N
. O

By O
the O
time N
of O
Romeo H
and O
Juliet O
, O
Richard H
II O
, O
and O
A H
Midsummer N
Night N
's H
Dream N
in O
the O
Mid-1590s O
, O
Shakespeare H
had O
begun O
to O
write O
a O
more O
natural O
poetry N
. O

He O
increasingly O
tuned O
his O
metaphors N
and O
images N
to O
the O
needs N
of O
the O
drama N
itself O
. O

Shakespeare H
's H
standard O
poetic O
form N
was O
blank O
verse N
, O
composed O
in O
iambic O
pentameter N
. O

In O
practice O
, O
this O
meant O
that O
his O
verse N
was O
usually O
unrhymed O
and O
consisted O
of O
ten O
syllables N
to O
a O
line N
, O
spoken O
with O
a O
stress N
on O
every O
second H
syllable N
. O

The O
blank O
verse N
of O
his O
early O
plays N
is O
quite O
different O
from O
that O
of O
his O
later O
ones N
. O

It O
is O
often O
beautiful O
, O
but O
its O
sentences N
tend O
to O
start O
, O
pause O
, O
and O
finish O
at O
the O
end N
of O
lines N
, O
with O
the O
risk N
of O
monotony N
. O

Once O
Shakespeare H
mastered O
traditional O
blank O
verse N
, O
he O
began O
to O
interrupt O
and O
vary O
its O
flow N
. O

This O
technique N
releases O
the O
new O
power N
and O
flexibility N
of O
the O
poetry N
in O
plays N
such O
as O
Julius H
Caesar H
and O
Hamlet H
. O

Shakespeare H
uses O
it O
, O
for O
example N
, O
to O
convey O
the O
turmoil N
in O
Hamlet H
's H
mind N
. O

The O
literary O
critic H
A. O
C. O
Bradley H
described O
this O
style N
as O
" O
more O
concentrated O
, O
rapid O
, O
varied O
, O
and O
, O
in O
construction N
, O
less O
regular O
, O
not O
seldom O
twisted O
or O
elliptical O
" O
. O

In O
the O
last O
phase N
of O
his O
career N
, O
Shakespeare H
adopted O
many O
techniques N
to O
achieve O
these O
effects N
. O

These O
included O
run-on O
lines N
, O
irregular O
pauses N
and O
stops N
, O
and O
extreme O
variations N
in O
sentence N
structure N
and O
length N
. O

In O
Macbeth O
, O
for O
example N
, O
the O
language N
darts O
from O
one N
unrelated O
metaphor N
or O
simile N
to O
another O
. O

The O
listener H
is O
challenged O
to O
complete O
the O
sense N
. O

The O
late O
romances N
, O
with O
their O
shifts N
in O
time N
and O
surprising O
turns N
of O
plot N
, O
inspired O
a O
last O
poetic O
style N
in O
which O
long O
and O
short O
sentences N
are O
set O
against O
one N
another O
, O
clauses N
are O
piled O
up O
, O
subject O
and O
object N
are O
reversed O
, O
and O
words N
are O
omitted O
, O
creating O
an O
effect N
of O
spontaneity N
. O

Shakespeare H
combined O
poetic O
genius N
with O
a O
practical O
sense N
of O
the O
theatre N
. O

Like O
all O
playwrights H
of O
the O
time N
, O
he O
dramatised O
stories N
from O
sources N
such O
as O
Plutarch O
and O
Holinshed O
. O

He O
reshaped O
each O
plot N
to O
create O
several O
centres N
of O
interest N
and O
to O
show O
as O
many O
sides N
of O
a O
narrative N
to O
the O
audience N
as O
possible O
. O

This O
strength N
of O
design N
ensures O
that O
a O
Shakespeare H
play O
can O
survive O
translation N
, O
cutting N
and O
wide O
interpretation N
without O
loss N
to O
its O
core N
drama N
. O

As O
Shakespeare H
's H
mastery N
grew O
, O
he O
gave O
his O
characters A
clearer O
and O
more O
varied O
motivations N
and O
distinctive O
patterns N
of O
speech N
. O

He O
preserved O
aspects N
of O
his O
earlier O
style N
in O
the O
later O
plays N
, O
however O
. O

Shakespeare H
's H
work N
has O
made O
a O
lasting O
impression N
on O
later O
theatre N
and O
literature N
. O

In O
particular O
, O
he O
expanded O
the O
dramatic O
potential N
of O
characterisation N
, O
plot N
, O
language N
, O
and O
genre N
. O

Until O
Romeo H
and O
Juliet O
, O
for O
example N
, O
romance O
had O
not O
been O
viewed O
as O
a O
worthy O
topic N
for O
tragedy N
. O

Soliloquies O
had O
been O
used O
mainly O
to O
convey O
information N
about O
characters A
or O
events N
; O

but O
Shakespeare H
used O
them O
to O
explore O
characters A
' O
minds N
. O

His O
work N
heavily O
influenced O
later O
poetry N
. O

The O
Romantic O
poets H
attempted O
to O
revive O
Shakespearean O
verse N
drama N
, O
though O
with O
little O
success N
. O

Critic H
George H
Steiner H
described O
all O
English O
verse N
dramas N
from O
Coleridge O
to O
Tennyson O
as O
" O
feeble O
variations N
on O
Shakespearean O
themes N
. O

" O
Shakespeare H
influenced O
novelists H
such O
as O
Thomas H
Hardy H
, O
William H
Faulkner O
, O
and O
Charles H
Dickens H
. O

The O
American O
novelist H
Herman H
Melville H
's H
soliloquies N
owe O
much O
to O
Shakespeare H
; O

his O
Captain O
Ahab O
in O
Moby O
- O
Dick H
is O
a O
classic O
tragic O
hero H
, O
inspired O
by O
King H
Lear O
. O

Scholars H
have O
identified O
20,000 O
pieces N
of O
music N
linked O
to O
Shakespeare H
's H
works O
. O

Shakespeare H
has O
also O
inspired O
many O
painters H
, O
including O
the O
Romantics O
and O
the O
Pre O
- O
Raphaelites O
. O

The O
Swiss O
Romantic O
artist H
Henry H
Fuseli O
, O
a O
friend H
of O
William H
Blake H
, O
even O
translated O
Macbeth O
into O
German O
. O

The O
psychoanalyst H
Sigmund O
Freud H
drew O
on O
Shakespearean O
psychology N
, O
in O
particular O
that O
of O
Hamlet H
, O
for O
his O
theories N
of O
human O
nature N
. O

Samuel H

quoted O
him O
more O
often O
than O
any O
other O
author H
in O
his O
A H
Dictionary N
of O
the O
English O
Language N

the O

serious O
work N

Expressions N

( O
Merchant O

) O
and O
" O
a O
foregone O
conclusion N
" O
( O
Othello O
) O
have O
found O
their O
way N
into O
everyday O
English O
speech N
. O

Shakespeare H
was O
not O
revered O
in O
his O
lifetime N
, O
but O
he O
received O
a O
large O
amount N
of O
praise N
. O

In O
1598 O
, O
the O
cleric H
and O
author H
Francis H
Meres O
singled O
him O
out H
from O
a O
group N
of O
English O
writers H
as O
" O
the O
most O
excellent O
" O
in O
both O
comedy N
and O
tragedy N
. O

The O
authors H
of O
the O
Parnassus O
plays N
at O
St H
John H
's H
College N
, O
Cambridge O
numbered O
him O
with O
Chaucer O
, O
Gower O
and O
Spenser O
. O

In O
the O
First O
Folio N
, O
Ben H
Jonson O
called O
Shakespeare H
the O
" O
Soul N

the O
age N
, O
the O
applause N
, O
delight N
, O
the O
wonder O
of O

stage N
" O
, O
though O
he O
had O
remarked O
elsewhere O
that O
" O
Shakespeare H
wanted O
art N

. O

Between O
the O
Restoration N
of O
the O
monarchy N
in O
1660 O
and O
the O
end N
of O
the O
17 O
th O
century N
, O
classical O
ideas N
were O
in O
vogue N
. O

As O
a O
result N
, O
critics H
of O
the O
time N
mostly O
rated O
Shakespeare H
below O
John H
Fletcher H
and O
Ben H
Jonson O
. O

Thomas H
Rymer O
, O
for O
example N
, O
condemned O
Shakespeare H
for O
mixing O
the O
comic O
with O
the O
tragic O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
poet H
and O
critic H
John H
Dryden O
rated O
Shakespeare H
highly O
, O
saying O
of O
Jonson O
, O
" O
I H
admire O
him O
, O
but O
I H
love O
Shakespeare H
" O
. O

For O
several O
decades N

Rymer O
's H
view N
held O
sway N
; O

but O
during O
the O
18 O
th O
century N
, O
critics H
began O
to O
respond O
to O
Shakespeare H
on O
his O
own O
terms N
and O
acclaim N
what O
they O
termed O
his O
natural O
genius N
. O

A H
series N
of O
scholarly O
editions N
of O
his O
work N
, O
notably O
those O
of O
Samuel H
Johnson H
in O
1765 O
and O
Edmond H
Malone H
in O
1790 O
, O
added O
to O
his O
growing O
reputation N

By O
1800 O
, O
he O
was O
firmly O
enshrined O
as O
the O
national O
poet H

Among O
those O
who O
championed O
him O
were O
the O
writers H
Voltaire O
, O
Goethe H
, O
Stendhal O
and O
Victor H
Hugo H

During O
the O
Romantic O
era N

Shakespeare H
was O
praised O
by O
the O
poet H
and O
literary O
philosopher H
Samuel H
Taylor H

; O

and O
the O
critic H
August H
Wilhelm H
Schlegel O
translated O
his O
plays N

the O
spirit N

German O
Romanticism N

In O
the O
19 O
th O
century N

critical O
admiration N
for O
Shakespeare H

genius N
often O
bordered O
on O
adulation N

" O
That O

, O
the O
essayist H

The O
Victorians H

The O
playwright H
and O
critic H
George H
Bernard H
Shaw H
mocked O
the O
cult N
of O

worship N
as O
" O
bardolatry N
" O
. O

He O
claimed O
that O
the O
new O
naturalism N

plays N
had O
made O
Shakespeare H
obsolete O
. O

The O
modernist O
revolution N

the O
arts N
during O
the O
early O
20 O
th O
century N
, O
far O
from O
discarding O
Shakespeare H
, O
eagerly O
enlisted O
his O
work N
in O
the O
service N
of O
the O
avant-garde N

The O
Expressionists H
in O
Germany H

the O
Futurists H

mounted O
productions N

Marxist O
playwright H

theatre N
under O
the O
influence N

The O
poet H

critic H
T. O
S. O
Eliot H
argued O
against O
Shaw H
that O
Shakespeare H

" O
primitiveness N

him O

Eliot H

along O

G. O
Wilson H
Knight H

the O
school N

led O
a O
movement N

a O
closer O
reading O
of O
Shakespeare H

imagery N

By O
the O
1980 O

, O
Shakespeare H
studies N

open O

New H
Historicism O

Around O
230 O
years N
after O
Shakespeare H

death N
, O
doubts N
began O
to O
be O
expressed O
about O
the O
authorship N

the O
works O
attributed O
to O
him O

Proposed O
alternative O
candidates H

Several O
" O
group N

have O
also O
been O
proposed O
. O

Some O
scholars H
claim O
that O
members H
of O
Shakespeare H

family H
were O
Catholics O
, O
at O
a O
time N
when O
Catholic H
practice O
was O
against O
the O
law N
. O

Shakespeare H
's H
mother H
, O
Mary H
Arden O
, O
certainly O
came O
from O
a O
pious O
Catholic H
family H
. O

The O
strongest O
evidence N
might O
be O
a O
Catholic H
statement N
of O
faith N
signed O
by O
John H
Shakespeare H
, O
found O
in O
1757 O
in O
the O
rafters N
of O
his O
former O
house N
in O
Henley O
Street H
. O

The O
document N
is O
now O
lost O
, O
however O
, O
and O
scholars H
differ O
as O
to O
its O
authenticity N
. O

In O
1591 O
the O
authorities H
reported O
that O
John H
Shakespeare H
had O
missed O
church N
" O
for O
fear N
of O
process N
for O
debt N
" O
, O
a O
common O
Catholic H
excuse O
. O

In O
1606 O
the O
name N
of O
William H

daughter H
Susanna O
appears O
on O
a O
list N
of O
those O
who O
failed O
to O
attend O
Easter O
communion N
in O
Stratford O
. O

Scholars H
find O
evidence N
both O
for O
and O
against O
Shakespeare H
's H
Catholicism N
in O
his O
plays N
, O
but O
the O
truth N
may O
be O
impossible O
to O
prove O
either O
way N
. O

Few O
details N
of O
Shakespeare H

sexuality N
are O
known O
. O

Susanna O

of O

born O
six O
months N

on O
26 O

Over O
the O
centuries N
some O
readers H
have O
posited O
that O
Shakespeare H

sonnets N
are O
autobiographical O

and O
point N

them O
as O
evidence N

his O
love O

the O

taken O
as O
evidence N

heterosexual O
liaisons N

No O
written O
contemporary O
description N
of O
Shakespeare H
's H
physical O
appearance N
survives O
, O
and O
no O
evidence N
suggests O
that O
he O
ever O
commissioned O
a O
portrait N
, O
so O
the O
Droeshout O
engraving N
, O
which O
Ben H
Jonson O
approved O
of O
as O
a O
good O
likeness N
, O
and O
his O
Stratford O
monument N
provide O
the O
best O
evidence N
of O
his O
appearance N
. O

From O
the O
18 O
th O
century N
, O
the O
desire N
for O
authentic O
Shakespeare H
portraits N
fuelled O
claims N
that O
various O
surviving O
pictures N
depicted O
Shakespeare H
. O

That O
demand N
also O
led O
to O
the O
production N
of O
several O
fake O
portraits N
, O
as O
well O
as O
mis O
- O
attributions N
, O
repaintings O
and O
relabelling O
of O
portraits N
of O
other O
people N
. O

Shakespeare H
's H
works O
include O
the O
36 O
plays N
printed O
in O
the O
First O
Folio N
of O
1623 O
, O
listed O
below O
according O
to O
their O
Folio N
classification N
as O
comedies N
, O
histories N
and O
tragedies N
. O

Two O
plays N
not O
included O
in O
the O
First O
Folio N
, O
The O
Two O
Noble H
Kinsmen H
and O
Pericles O
, O
Prince H
of O
Tyre O
, O
are O
now O
accepted O
as O
part N
of O
the O
canon N
, O
with O
scholars H
agreed O
that O
Shakespeare H
made O
a O
major O
contribution N
to O
their O
composition N
. O

No O
Shakespearean O
poems N
were O
included O
in O
the O
First O
Folio N
. O

It O
was O
telephone N
conference N
, O
and O
it O
was O
only O
me H
and O
, O
you H
know O
, O
the O
guy H
. O

no O
, O
no O
, O
I H
am O
lucky O
to O
that O

because O
my H
father H
gets O
sick O
and O
in O
hospital N
now O
, O
so O
she O
had O
to O
quit O
. O

I H
want O
to O
meet O
on O
one N
or O
two O
o'clock O
in O
afternoon N
. O

So O
she O
just O
kept O
asking O
, O
" O
Please O
, O
please O
, O
please O
can O
I H
have O
her O
? O

So O
, O
recently O
, O
Gusto O
or O
Jonathan H
's H
, O
such O
a O
restaurant N
have O
free O
drink N
corner N
. O

are O
you H
— O
now O
? O

there O
are O
one N
cat A
on O
the O
car N
. O

" O
Good O
Will H
Hunting O
" O
. O

And O
there O
are O
various O
clothes N
. O

Upright O
, O
I H
think O
. O

Thank O
you H
. O

And O
some O
alcohol N
will O
help O
us H
a O
lot N
. O

I H
want O
to O
dress O
. O

And O
then O
you H
always O
have O
to O
drive O
your H
car N
to O
go O
somewhere O
. O

excuse O
me H
, O
what O
is O
your H
shop N
? O

so O
when O
I H
order O
, O
I H
always O
have O
to O
ask O
what O
's H
inside O
of O
this O
. O

because O
, O
last O
night N
, O
I H
drank O
a O
lot N
. O

But O
I H
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's H
very O
safe O
if O
nobody H
knows O
much O
about O
the O
place N
or O
the O
landscape N
, O
because O
you H
never O
know O
what O
would O
happen O
as O
in O
the O
picture N
. O

I H
will O
go O
to O
Shibuya O
in O
dinner N
. O

I H
will O
be O
working O
for O
the O
newspaper N
again O
. O

But O
there O
must O
be O
nice O
ones N
at O
Hiroshima O
. O

To H
buy O
some O
books N
. O

In O
a O
fine O
day N
, O
a O
girl H
and O
a O
boy H
go O
to O
a O
zoo N
. O

It O
's H
a O
also O
sales N
corner N
. O

I H
wonder O
. O

I H
'm O
a O
customer H
? O

the O
main O
point N
is O
that O
it O
's H
not O
just O
we H
the O
students H
move O
to O
the O
other O
class N
. O

I H
'm O
sorry O
. O

But O
then O
I H
eat O
a O
little O
bit N
of O
fish A
and O
the O
fish A
broth N
is O
always O
in O
Japanese O
food N
. O

I H
see O
. O

I H
want O
to O
study O
about O
Human A
Literature N
next O
year N
. O

OK O
, O
there O
's H
roughly O
forty O
students H
in O
the O
club N
. O

I H
like O
dolphin A
is O
animal A
. O

two O
years N
ago O
, O
I H
wanted O
to O
find O
out H
a O
new O
house N
because O
at O
that O
time N
, O
I H
lived O
in O
my H
parents H
' O
house N
. O

I H
will O
go O
to O
Shinjuku O
, O
and O
I H
play O
with O
my H
friend H
. O

Then O
, O
I H
want O
to O
use H
that O
tour N
, O
but O
how O
it O
costs O
? O

But O
depends O
on O
what O
kind N
of O
party N
. O

My H
name N
is O
Charlie H
. O

more O
darkness N
. O

I H
mean O
they O
always O
welcome O
to O

and O
I H
bought O
him O
a O
clothes N
for O
congratulation N
. O

It O
's H
a O
very O
big O
city N
. O

I H
see O
. O

So O
that O
website N
is O
created O
by O
women H
for O
women H
. O

Not O
really O
, O
not O
that O
much O
. O

So O
it O
's H
good O
to O
live O
, O
I H
think O
. O

Are O
you H
sure O
? O

Because O
I H
had O
the O
receipt N
. O

I H
'd O
like O
to O
go O
to O
travel O
by O
airplane N
or O
ship N
or O
by O
car N
. O

And O
also O
we H
had O
a O
kind N
of O
school N
uniform N
. O

Why O
I H
think O
so O
because O
I H
have O
been O
in O
Australia O
for O
three O
years N
. O

Yes O
, O
I H
do O
. O

And O
they O
ended O
up O
staying O
in O
a O
hotel N
room N
and O
looking O
out H
outside O
from O
the O
room N
. O

About O
anything O
in O
this O
picture N
? O

Then O
, O
it O
was O
very O
beautiful O
place N
where O
they O
can O
see O
mountains N
. O

But O
eventually O
, O
the O
boy H
and O
the O
girl H
brought O
the O
cat A
. O

Not O
so O
many O
Japanese O
there O
. O

but O
their O
house N
was O
not O
so O
big O
. O

But O
still O
the O
differences N
say O
, O
how O
should O
I H
describe O
it O
, O
in O
terms N
of O
the O
not O
only O
appearance N
but O
the O
way N
they O
behave O
. O

Interesting O
in O
Turkey O
? O

more O
nante O
iundaro O
whipped O
it O
or O
. O

I H
'm O
feeling O
like O
I H
'm O
a O
student H
. O

And O
in O
the O
far O
end N
of O
the O
restaurant N
, O
a O
lady H
is O
playing O
the O
piano N
. O

and O
they O
went O
to O
the O
zoo N
. O

I H
belong O
to O
Noh O
club N
. O

My H
room N
is O
books N
and O
videos N
and O
somethings O
, O
my H
room N
i H
my H
room N
is O
very O
dirty O
. O

So O
I H
'm O
very O
in O
hurry N
. O

And O
this O
man H
came O
on O
a O
bike N
with O
a O
mobile O
phone N
on O
his O
hand N
. O

But O
, O
sometimes O
I H
want O
buy O
clothes N
, O
suddenly O
. O

I H
'm O
in O
the O
house N
. O

My H
name N
is O
Charlie H
. O

And O
" O
Star O
Wars O
" O
joei O
. O

It O
has O
a O
lot N
of O
supermarkets N
and O
schools N
and O
cultural O
facilities N
like O
library N
and O
concert N
hall N
. O

Yes O
thank O
you H
. O

They O
looked O
at O
lion A
. O

You H
are O
welcome O
. O

when O
I H
went O
to O
Okinawa O
in O
December O
with O
my H
friend H
, O
we H
went O
a O
nice O
restaurant N
. O

but O
when O
I H
reached O
to O
Singapore O
, O
there O
's H
nobody H
who O
received O
me H
at O
the O
airport N
. O

My H
name N
is O
Charlie H
. O

She O
tried O
to O
attract O
the O
students H
more O
. O

I H
'm O
truly O
sorry O
again O
. O

And O
unfortunately O
, O
the O
man H
on O
the O
motorcycle N
bumped O
in O
to O
the O
car N
. O

I H
do O
n't O
know O
. O

So O
we H
do O
n't O
have O
dogs A
. O

Maybe O
she O
's H
gon O
na O
be O
better O
than O
my H
English O
.... O

it O
looks O
just O
alike O
. O

there O
are O
, O
for O
example N
, O
boiled O
fish A
or O
curry N
rice N
, O
such O
a O
very O
ordinary O
foods N
. O

But O
I H
do O
n't O
know O
why O

So O
rather O
than O
skiing O
, O
I H
prefer O
skating N
because O
skating N
, O
you H
do O
n't O
have O
to O
go O
up O
, O
and O
you H
're O
just O
going O
round O
and O
round O
on O
this O
flat O
surface N
. O

in O
the O
movie N
theater N
because O
in O
the O
movie N
theater N
, O
yes O
, O
it O
is O
very O
big O
scene N
. O

and O
then O
his O
father H
had O
to O
go O
somewhere O

with O
my H
girlfriend H
. O

And O
also O
, O
they O
have O
a O
very O
different O
atmosphere N
than O
other O
restaurants N
. O

thank O
you H
. O

And O
then O
he O
just O
had O
to O
have O
his O
motorcycle N
towed O
away O
because O
it O
was O
not O
fit O
to O
driving O
. O

It O
is O
nine O
o'clock O
. O

He O
dropped O
his O
cellular O
phone N
. O

And O
it O
looks O
like O
it O
does O
n't O
fit O
me H
. O

Yes O
, O
yes O
. O

She O
's H
kind N
of O
like O
a O
waitress H
. O

So O
I H
do O
n't O
remember O
the O
scenery N
. O

she O
's H
eighty O
- O
four O
years N
old O
. O

Nice O
to O
meet O
you H
, O
too O
. O

and O
, O
you H
see O
, O
I H
live O
alone O
, O
and O
the O
window N
is O
broken O
and O
have O
to O
work N
tomorrow N
. O

You H
know O
, O
we H
hang O
out H
. O

You H
, O
too O
. O

I H
'm O
from O
Saitama O
- O
ku O
. O

it O
's H
not O
fair O
because O
I H
'm O
a O
passenger H
. O

So O
they O
get O
along O
very O
well O
. O

You H
know O
? O

the O
place N
is O
right O
next O
door N
. O

Thank O
you H
. O

I H
'm O
working O
very O
harder O
in O
my H
office N
. O

I H
have O
to O
apologize O
first O
that O
I H
could O
n't O
come O
to O
the O
party N
you H
invited O
me H
for O
. O

So O
that O
's H
the O
bad O
point N
I H
think O
. O

thank O
you H
. O

that O
's H
why O
many O
people N
, O
I H
think O
they O
drive O
over O
speed N
anyway O
. O

a O
small O
girl H
is O
playing O
in O
front N
of O
the O
big O
window N
who O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
daughter H
of O
this O
family H
. O

Nice O
to O
meet O
you H
. O

And O
my H
father H
and O
booked O
a O
restaurant N
we H
sat O
on O
the O
table N
. O

Only O
been O
about O
seven O
months N
or O
so O
. O

So O
I H
could O
n't O
take O
on O
a O
plane N
I H
was O
planning O
to O
. O

And O
they O
big O
lion A
and O
next O
he O
is O
eating O
soft O
cream N
and O
nandattakana O
koreha O
osarusanha O
. O

I H
would O
way N

And O
we H
went O
to O
the O
same O
college N
, O
and O
she O
's H
actress H
. O

Things N
are O
very O
deferent O
in O
my H
neighborhood N
and O
the O
rest N
of O
downtown N
area N
. O

And O
I H
was O
born O
in O
Tokyo O
prefecture N
and O
always O
it O
snows O
one N
meter N
or O
more O
. O

And O
not O
only O
the O
photographer H
, O
also O
his O
story N
about O
, O
the O
photograph N
in O
the O
mountain N
was O
quite O
impressed O
me H
. O

I H
have O
a O
one N
sister H
, O
and O
my H
parents H
. O

Just O
call O
me H
Charlie H

like O
a O
tuna A
. O

And O
he O
happen O
to O
come O
to O
Japan O
. O

And O
also O
the O
attitude N
of O
the O
students H
is O
quite O
different O
. O

And O
I H
also O
try O
to O
see O
a O
lot N
of O
movies N
and O
I H
try O
to O
see O
a O
lot N
of O
shows N
on O
T H
V N
to O
keep O
me H
up O
- O
to O
- O
date N
about O
what O
's H
going O
on O
inside O
those O
young O
kids H
minds N
. O

It O
's H
summer N
holiday N
there O
. O

it O
is O
featuring O
, O
I H
do O
n't O
know O
his O
name N
, O
but O
small O
boy H
and O
directed O
by O
Steven H
Spielberg O
. O

So O
, O
see O
if O
I H
was O
talking O
to O
American O
people N
, O
it O
's H
more O
easy O
for O
me H
to O
understand O
. O

Very O
fun O
. O

The O
clean O
up O
is O
too O
heavy O
. O

After O
this O
I H
have O
school N
. O

maybe O
it O
's H
not O
a O
car N
. O

And O
they O
promised O
to O
meet O
in O
the O
front N
of O
restaurant N
. O

It O
's H
OK O
, O
yes O
. O

Yes O
, O
I H
'm O
fine O
, O
thank O
you H
. O

so O
and O
my H
family H
does O
n't O
like O
animals A
. O

Hokkaido O
have O
fresh O
sea N
. O
... O
... O

But O
at O
some O
points O
in O
her O
life N
, O
she O
has O
to O
make O
a O
decision N
. O

the O
door N
is O
open O
. O

So O
until O
this O
coming O
this O
station N
, O
so O
today N
heavy O
traffic N
jam N

Thank O
you H
very O
much O
. O

I H
likes O
play O
sport N
. O

fine O
, O
thank O
you H
. O

Yamanoko O
has O
very O
many O
people N
and O
boys H
are O
more O
than O
girls H
. O

Because O
to O
tell O
the O
truth N
, O
I H
will O
reply O
for O
the O
programs N
of O
Ryukyu O
as O
an O
exchange O
student H
. O

So O
I H
wanted O
to O
talk O
about O
it O
. O

I H
studied O
English O
for O
this O
test N
. O

I H
was O
really O
surprised O
when O
I H
came O
like O
four O
months N
ago O
or O
five O
. O

She O
is O
one N
year N
and O
two O
months N
. O

it O
's H
my H
mathematics N
class N

I H
mean O
going O
to O
a O
restaurant N
or O
like O
renting O
out H
a O
place N
would O
take O
money N
or O
take O
time N
as O
in O
planning O
. O

But O
now O
she O
look O
at O
her O
pet A
. O

And O
Taro O
explained O
the O
situation N
to O
the O
police N
officer H
. O

curry N
, O
ramen O
. O

I H
like O
it O
. O

So O
but O
this O
is O
a O
big O
store N
. O

and O
then O
if O
you H
are O
on O
, O
you H
have O
to O
call O
your H
insurance N
company N
. O

But O
not O
Alpine O
ski N
. O

So O
I H
want O
to O
go O
to O
New H
York H
are O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O

I H
did O
n't O
do O
anything O
. O

But O
before O
it O
, O
I H
go O
to O
Starbucks O
, O
because O
I H
like O
coffee N
. O

And O
you H
know O
, O
like O
in O
Japan O
, O
you H
have O
P H
E H
lessons N
and O
you H
have O
to O
do O
certain O
things N
. O

Or H
ride O
mountain N
bike N
. O

So O
it O
's H
very O
convenient O
city N
, O

yeah O
, O
please O
invite O
me H
again O
. O

And O
so O
at O
a O
resort N
area N
, O
you H
either O
swim O
or O
play O
golf N
. O

I H
want O
something O
. O

sometimes O
I H
cooked O
for O
my H
family H
. O

I H
do O
n't O
like O
to O
read O
like O
really O
hard O
ones N
or O
difficult O
ones N
. O

Thank O
you H
. O
? O

Very O
very O
middle O
mild O
rhythm N
is O
very O
favorite O
. O

And O
it O
's H
seems O
nine O
o'clock O
, O
I H
guess O
. O

Nice O
to O
meet O
you H
. O

I H
hope O
going O
abroad O
if O
I H
pass O
this O
test N
. O

Many O
, O
many O
. O

I H
need O
your H
help O
right O
now O
. O

What O
a O
pity N
. O

And O
she O
loves O
animals A
. O

Because O
I H
used O
to O
live O
in O
France O
, O
and O
I H
speak O
French O
. O

Japanese O
French O
. O

Thank O
you H
very O
much O
. O

in O
that O
shop N
, O
we H
can O
eat O
the O
very O
real O
Thailand O
curry N
. O

Then O
, O
because O
of O
the O
arrangement N
of O
the O
police N
, O
finally O
, O
we H
agreed O
with O
each O
other O
and O
I H
told O
him O
I H
would O
pay O
a O
money N
for O
the O
motorcycle N
in O
order O
to O
repair N
. O

U H
K O
? O

And O
they O
were O
planning O
to O
go O
on O
picnic N
. O

so O
I H
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
your H
party N

And O
I H
back O
to O
Gifu O
, O
about O
at O
ten O
yesterday N
. O

in O
Okinawa O
, O
I H
can O
watch O
the O
many O
movies N
and O
playing O
the O
theater N
. O

and O
I H
think O
I H
'd O
like O
to O
stay O
at O
home N
and O
talk O
to O
my H
boyfriend H
about O
the O
job N
hunting N
or O
about O
my H
study O
. O

And O
my H
wife H
cooked O
some O
dishes N
for O
us H
. O

I H
do O
n't O
remember O
. O

So O
I H
had O
to O
telephone N
the O
police N
. O

so O
no O
lunch N
and O
no O
dinner N
today N
. O

But O
now O
, O
I H
ca O
n't O
go O
to O
the O
movie N
. O

But O
actually O
my H
father H
and O
mother H
, O
they O
were O
pretty O
happy O
about O
my H
decision N
. O

But O
if O
cat A
, O
maybe O
not O
. O

so O
we H
quickly O
packed O
. O

next O
month N
the O
Yankees O
gon O
na O
come O
to O
play O
. O

And O
since O
it O
is O
one N
of O
the O
countrysides N
in O
Japan O
you H
need O
a O
car N
to O
go O
around O
. O

So O
I H
could O
n't O
cook O
. O

so O
this O
is O
not O
my H
fault N
. O

And O
boy H
talked O
to O
her O
. O

Now O
, O
we H
have O
a O
hamster A
. O

This O
size N
. O

But O
if O
I H
have O
the O
driver H
, O
so O
it O
's H
not O
good O
to O
idea N
to O
leave O
him O
alone O
, O
so O
I H
need O
to O
call O
the O
police N
or O
of O
course N
hospital N
. O

In O
cold O
day N
, O
they O
go O
to O
the O
zoo N
in O
the O
afternoon N
. O

I H
do O
. O

I H
went O
a O
restaurant N
with O
my H
father H
one N
day N
last O
week N
. O

I H
'm O
not O
quite O
sure O
, O
but O
maybe O
for O
the O
whole O
day N
. O

And O
I H
do O
n't O
know O
. O

my H
father H
, O
mother H
, O
brother H
, O
grandmother H
and O
me H
. O

So O
I H
present N
on O
back O
seat N
. O

I H
'm O
going O
to O
work N
again O
. O

I H
see O
. O

So O
would O
you H
please O
say O
hi O
to O
everybody O
and O
have O
fun O
. O

Maybe O
the O
lecture N
is O
boring O
, O
it O
's H
so O
by O
the O
book O
maybe O
. O

And O
I H
did O
that O
course N
. O

My H
name N
is O
Charlie H
. O

I H
'm O
accountant H
. O

in O
restaurant N
. O

And O
just O
, O
you H
know O
, O
cheer O
me H
up O
. O

first O
, O
they O
saw O
the O
lion A
. O

My H
name N
is O
Charlie H
. O

you H
know O
, O
I H
mean O
I H
was O
surprised O
and O
I H
got O
mad O
at O
him O
although O
he O
was O
not O
intentionally O
trying O
to O
, O
you H
know O
, O
... O
hit O
my H
shoulder N
. O

But O
I H
said O
, O
" O
No O
. O
" O
. O

I H
feel O
like O
I H
'm O
like O
the O
part N
of O
the O
wind N
, O
just O
going O
through O
the O
woods N
. O

And O
actually O
always O
that O
there O
are O
a O
lot N
of O
flowers A
in O
Bali O
Island O
. O

Thank O
you H
. O

And O
she O
have O
a O
brown O
hair N
and O
very O
cute O
. O

just O
read O
books N
. O

And O
the O
man H
, O
he O
's H
tasting O
red O
wine N
. O

So O
, O
I H
have O
to O
be O
with O
her O
. O

in O
aviation N
company N
, O
everyone O
has O
a O
shift N
for O
their O
job N
. O

How O
about O
meeting N
at O
noon N
? O

She O
went O
to O
the O
car N
. O

I H
mean O
, O
he O
's H
old O
so O
he O
ca O
n't O
run O
so O
much O
. O

I H
'm O
trying O
to O
study O
because O
there O
was O
a O
mid O
- O
term N
, O
I H
just O
bummed O
all O
the O
tests N

we H
decide O
which O
one N
's H
not O
too O
crowded O
. O

You H
could O
go O
into O
either O
one N
. O

And O
how O
do O
I H
get O
the O
New H
York H
as O
possible O
early O
. O

I H
mean O
, O

So O
if O
you H
get O
off O
the O
platform N
, O
it O
'll O
be O
very O
dangerous O
. O

My H
name N
is O
Charlie H
. O

And O
she O
looks O
like O
pointer N
because O
her O
mother H
is O
pointer N
. O

In O
Saitama O
. O

And O
then O
I H
ride O
off O
- O
road N
by O
mountain N
bike N
to O
mountain N
top N
. O

I H
have O
to O
work N
. O

They O
just O
like O
using O
themselves O
. O

today N
I H
do O
n't O
study O
. O

because O
I H
was O
student H
. O

So O
everyone O
paid O
money N
to O
me H
. O

I H
live O
in O
an O
apartment N
house N

and O
they O
playing O
in O
the O
house N
. O

But O
I H
ca O
n't O
. O

But O
they O
do O
n't O
really O
care N
because O
they O
wo O
n't O
stop N
lessons N
just O
for O
one N
person H
just O
saying O
like O
" O
You H
should O
n't O
be O
using O
your H
cell N
phone N
. O

We H
are O
going O
to O
meet O
Hachikou O
mae O
. O

And O
behind O
this O
ski N
resort N
, O
there O
is O
big O
mountains N
covered O
with O
white O
snow N
. O

So O
now O
, O
a O
waiter H
explain O
some O
wine N
. O

Fifty O
dollars N
. O

So O
I H
think O
I H
want O
ask O
something O
to O
him O
. O

I H
have O
a O
bad O
news N
for O
you H
. O

But O
I H
must O
take O
my H
daughter H
to O
the O
hospital N
. O

And O
I H
imagine O
what O
she O
like O
. O

I H
really O
wanted O
to O
go O
. O

And O
we H
put O
those O
in O
our H
van N
, O
and O
went O
to O
the O
river N
. O

maybe O
that O
's H
why O
. O

And O
we H
found O
a O
cat A
in O
that O
box N
. O

just O
call O
. O

So O
I H
study O
hard O
about O
accounting N
. O

and O
yeah O
, O
just O
a O
few O
small O
, O
easy O
dishes N
, O

I H
went O
to O
home N
. O

Pardon O
atto O
Watch O
home N
pages N
or O
do O
chat N
or O
something O
. O

And O
the O
business N
man H
got O
angry O
because O
the O
bag N
dropped O
into O
to O
the O
train N
rail N
because O
of O
the O
other O
man H
's H
elbow N
. O

That O
I H
'm O
sure O
he O
likes O
parties N
rather O
than O
driving O
. O

You H
're O
welcome O
. O

Almost O
you H
can O
see O
any O
ethnic O
groups N
from O
all O
over O
the O
world N
. O

and O
I H
repair N
, O

I H

my H
house N
. O

Thank O

, O
you H
know O
, O
whether O
it O
's H
right O
person H
or O
not O
. O

I H

Thank O

offered O
to O

, O
you H
ca O
n't O
miss O

. O

and O
I H

and O
everything O

the O

is O

crash O
. O

On O
the O
Wednesday O
. O

I H
'm O
fine O
thank O
you H
. O

Thank O
you H
very O
much O
. O

And O
he O
was O
using O
his O
mobile O
phone N
whilst O
he O
was O
driving O
a O
scooter N
. O

please O
repeat O
. O

I H
'm O
fine O
. O

Excuse O
me H
? O

So O
I H
need O
help O
. O

But O
I H
quite O
often O
come O
here O
and O
have O
bought O
quite O
a O
lot N
of O
things N
. O

But O
I H
promise N
I H
will O
come O
to O
the O
next O
party N
. O

But O
anyway O
, O
we H
stopped O
at O
a O
traffic N
light N
. O

I H
'm O
OK O
. O

my H
name N
is O
Charlie H
. O
? O

And O
I H
see O
a O
nice O
couple N
at O
the O
table N
. O

Thank O
you H
very O
much O
. O

my H
hometown N
near O
the O
gym N
. O

I H
do O
n't O
know O
. O

classical O
music N
is O
healing O
, O
relaxing O
. O

Summer N
sports N
? O

So O
that O
's H
why O
I H
can O
not O
stop N
buying O
. O

I H
asked O
how O
much O
are O
they O
. O

should O
I H
make O
up O
story N
? O

I H
could O
n't O
catch O
it O
. O

When O
I H
enrolled O
college N
. O

Because O
I H
just O
ca O
n't O
drive O
a O
big O
car N
. O

But O
the O
different O
thing N
is O
that O
the O
supermarket N
in O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
did O
n't O
offer O
a O
plastic N
bag N
. O

When O
John H
was O
trying O
to O
turn O
right O
, O
he O
did O
n't O
see O
the O
man H
on O
the O
bike N
. O

And O
behind O
our H
house N
, O
we H
have O
a O
little O
farm N
. O

When O
will O
you H
be O
free O
? O

So O
probably O
ten O
minutes N
or O
something O
. O

My H
hometown N
is O
Okinawa O
. O

so O
we H
had O
to O
study O
very O
hard O
. O

No O
, O
not O
really O
. O

And O
so O
, O
I H
called O
police N
and O
to O
come O
there O

See O
you H
. O

in O
my H
hometown N
. O

so O
I H
enjoyed O
it O
very O
much O
. O

I H
'll O
arrange O
my H
time N
. O

And O
her O
face N
is O
calm O
. O

and O
two O
years N
ago O
, O
my H
friend H
give O
me H
a O
bicycle N

So O
could O
you H
refund N
or O
exchange O
the O
new O
one N
. O

And O
I H
I H
decide O
I H
did O
n't O
decided O
which O
necktie N
is O
a O
best O
for O
him O
. O

and O
I H
had O
to O
take O
him O
to O
the O
hospital N
. O

Because O
he O
is O
now O
thinking O
of O
taking O
an O
entrance N
examination N
to O
Stanford O
junior O
high O
school N
. O

I H
just O
have O
to O
say O
I H
'm O
sorry O
. O

That O
is O
very O
cute O
movie N
. O

I H
like O
it O
. O

I H
live O
in O
Okinawa O
, O
in O
Hiroshima O
- O
ku O
. O

So O
I H
ca O
n't O
go O
tonight N
. O

But O
I H
had O
a O
small O
gathering N
on O
last O
Saturday O
. O

when O
I H
was O
in O
America O
, O
I H
took O
Spanish O
classes N
. O

the O
female O
teacher H
, O
she O
is O
teaching O
mathematics N
. O

My H
hobby N
is O
cooking O
. O

I H
often O
watch O
movies N
about O
fourth O
a O
week N
. O

I H
live O
in O
Tokyo O
. O

where O
can O
I H
have O
a O
ticket N
? O

But O
next O
time N
, O
I H
really O
love O
to O
go O
there O
. O

old O
using O
tools N
. O

Yeah O
, O
I H
like O
antique N
. O

And O
four O
kids H
are O
playing O
a O
snowball A
fight N
. O

Because O
I H
just O
ca O
n't O
stand O
the O
heat N
. O

there O
is O
a O
bed N
with O
a O
cat A
. O

I H
want O
the O
shoes N
color N
is O
black O
. O

Track N
number N
two O
. O

my H
hobby N
is O
do O
exercising N
and O
listening O
to O
music N
. O

when O
I H
have O
a O
bath N
, O
the O
bath N
in O
this O
company N
together O
have O
a O
bath N
. O

Therefore O
, O
I H
have O
to O
go O
to O
a O
doctor H
to O
show O
her O
. O

Let O
's H
keep O
doing O
that O
. O
" O
. O

I H
am O
not O
fine O
. O

so O
maybe O
the O
restaurant N
has O
not O
wine N
. O

From O
that O
company N
but O
not O
from O
the O
railroad N
. O

So O
bad O
, O

Many O
Americans O
and O
there O
are O
among O
people N
who O
is O
involved O
embassy N
go O
there O
also O
. O

Maybe O
ski N
is O
not O
, O
you H
know O
, O
my H
kind N
of O
thing N
to O
do O
. O

and O
I H
think O
he O
should O
n't O
do O
that O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
is O
. O

OK O
depend O
on O
the O
accident N

Grand O
Canyon O
? O

I H
'm O
kind N
of O
studying O
Spanish O
right O
now O
. O

for O
example N
, O
the O
shoes N
were O
sold O
at O
thirty O
percent N
discount N
. O

I H
just O
working O
here O
until O
you H
know O
, O
midnight N
or O
something O
and O
went O
back O
to O
home N

So O
I H
want O
to O
eat O
lunch N
with O
you H
. O

It O
's H
not O
the O
sports N
type N
or O
not O
mountain N
bike N
style N
. O

I H
beg O
your H
pardon N
? O

I H
brought O
in O
the O
trunks N
of O
car N
. O

I H
do O
like O
cooking O
. O

The O
lyrics N
of O
the O
songs N
are O
really O
social O
ones N
. O

I H
had O
English O
grammar N
and O
homeroom N
. O

this O
is O
Japan O
, O
but O
, O
in O
the O
United O
States O
, O
you H
might O
be O
sued O
by O
me H
, O
if O
something O
happens O
to O
me H
. O

So O
I H
usually O
go O
out H
for O
dinner N
. O

So O
I H
really O
do O
n't O
feel O
comfortable O
.... O

And O
it O
took O
me H
a O
lot N
of O
time N
to O
finish O
everything O
. O

At O
first O
, O
it O
was O
very O
interesting O
, O
but O
gradually O
, O
I H
got O
tired O
of O
researching O
. O

Thank O
you H
very O
much O
. O
— O
because O
I H
study O
tutorial N
for O
twenty O
hours N
, O
ja O

And O
I H
was O
driving O
with O
my H
mobile O
phone N
in O
my H
ears N
. O

my H
wife H
's H
father H
dead O
one N
years N
ago O
. O

you H
can O
order O
anything O
. O
" O
. O

And O
there O
is O
a O
snowman N
in O
front N
of O
the O
car N
. O

So O
I H
'm O
wet O
. O

Now O
, O
I H
'd O
love O
to O
see O
her O
. O

I H
am O
not O
afford O
to O
buy O
a O
expensive O
one N
. O

And O
also O
, O
up O
here O
, O
there O
is O
a O
couple N
having O
tea N
, O
probably O
it O
was O
cold O
outside O
so O
they O
are O
warming O
themselves O
up O
. O

It O
's H
so O
difficult O
to O
master O
the O
economics N

Thank O
you H
. O

And O
I H
lived O
there O
for O
nine O
years N
and O
one N
month N
. O

What O
's H
the O
proper O
term N
for O
, O
in O
Japanese O
, O
we H
use H
manshon O
. O

but O
our H
team N
mates O
are O
very O
nice O
people N
. O

But O
I H
need O
a O
more O
tough O
one N
. O

Overtime O
working O
. O

my H
restaurant N
is O
nandakke O
not O
expensive O
. O

But O
, O
now O
, O
I H
'm O
very O
nervous O
. O

And O
no O
my H
sister H
would O
like O
to O
my H
sister H
wanted O
to O
pick O
up O
that O
cat A
. O

I H
'm O
very O
sorry O
that O
I H
could O
n't O
make O
it O
because O
I H
had O
a O
bad O
headache N

However O
, O
it O
became O
very O
windy O
, O
and O
was O
like O
a O
storm N
. O

I H
'll O
just O
buy O
another O
ticket N
. O

And O
my H
father H
works O
in O
trade N
business N
, O
like O
that O
. O

And O
they O
decided O
to O
go O
back O
. O

She O
like O
the O
kitten A
, O
and O
she O
seems O
to O
keep O
the O
kitten A
. O

And O
we H
took O
the O
table N
, O
and O
the O
waiter H
is O
coming O
. O

And O
it O
's H
hard O
for O
me H
, O
but O
after O
that O
, O
I H
feel O
really O
, O
really O
comfortable O
. O
" O

she O
choose O
the O
one N
of O
necktie N
. O

But O
after O
just O
we H
fixed O
up O
everything O
, O
there O
was O
a O
storm N
. O

I H
was O
very O
surprised O
. O

I H
want O
to O
ticket N
to O
New H
York H
by O
train N
. O

and O
I H
'm O
so O
sorry O
to O
be O
late O
. O

so O
that O
's H
a O
problem N
. O

He O
's H
running O
. O

Then O
I H
went O
home N
, O
and O
opened O
it O
. O

But O
weather N
is O
beautiful O
. O

No O
, O
but O
I H
might O
the O
go O
to O
a O
Japanese O
university N
that O
applies O
S H

so O
I H
have O
no O
time N
to O
watch O
the O
movies N
. O

Yes O
, O
I H
do O
. O

My H
name N
is O
Charlie H
. O

All O
of O
them O
? O

But O
maybe O
one N
year N
later O
, O
he O
will O
come O
with O
my H
house N
because O
he O
will O
be O
junior O
high O
school N
. O

I H
used O
to O
live O
there O
, O
seven O
years N
. O

it O
is O
located O
in O
the O
Saitama O
Prefecture N
. O

Really O
we H
did O
n't O
have O
anything O
particular O
schedule N
, O
but O
we H
were O
just O
enjoying O
the O
scenery N
. O

I H
do O
n't O
like O
to O
go O
to O
supermarket N
. O

Free O
time N
. O

So O
, O
hai O
only O
. O

Where O
do O
you H
want O
to O
watch O
? O

And O
he O
was O
complaining O
to O
the O
young O
man H
that O
was O
driving O
the O
car N
. O

Snow N
mountain N
. O

Good O
morning N
. O

yeah O
, O
they O
drove O
to O
school N
. O

So O
, O
the O
subway N
I H
had O
to O
take O
was O
greatly O
delayed O
and O
although O
I H
went O
to O
the O
station N
at O
the O
right O
time N
, O
but O
the O
subway N
train N
did O
n't O
start O
for O
half O
an O
hour N
. O

usually O
I H
have O
to O
do O
some O
house N
work N
. O

I H
live O
in O
Hiroshima O
Station O
which O
is O
on O
the O
Hokkaido O
line N
. O

In O
America O
. O

and O
we H
stayed O
with O
her O
from O
this O
morning N
. O

what O
do O
you H
think O
about O
" O
Exorcist O
" O
? O

Little H
bit N
tired O
. O

And O
she O
always O
hungry O
, O
and O
she O
always O
sleeping O
. O

I H
give O
her O
? O

So O
the O
hotel N
serves O
us H
at O
a O
little O
discount N
price N
. O

I H
do O
n't O
know O
if O
... O
go O
this O
. O

I H
'm O
fine O
. O

My H
name N
is O
Charlie H
. O

So O
she O
was O
very O
exciting O
to O
buy O
things N
for O
herselfs O
. O

I H
will O
back O
here O
a O
couple N
of O
hours N
later O
. O

you H
have O
to O
study O
to O
know O
the O
laws N
to O
drive O
along O
the O
street N
. O

I H
talk O
about O
a O
monkey A
to O
her O
and O
We H
go O
on O
from O
zoo N
. O

how O
can O
I H
say O
, O
one N
student H
who O
is O
a O
man H
who O
is O
crossing O
his O
arm N
and O
having O
a O
chewing O
gum N
and O
looking O
outside O
. O

And O
sale N
. O

so O
I H
did O
n't O
have O
time N
to O
go O
. O

And O
then O
, O
he O
reserved O
the O
seat N
for O
two O
in O
the O
restaurant N
and O
he O
choice N
the O
course N
menu N
at O
the O
restaurant N
. O

Six O
thirty O
? O

Do O
you H
know O
JICA O
? O

it O
seems O
very O
expensive O
because O
the O
speaker N
is O
very O
big O
. O

It O
's H
very O
difficult O
question N
. O

and O
so O
I H
have O
no O
idea N

Yeah O
, O
I H
think O
it O
looks O
very O
good O
. O

Nice O
to O
meet O
you H
, O
too O
. O

And O
size N
of O
that O
is O
X O
L. O

and O
from O
healthy O
point N
of O
view N
, O
it O
's H
not O
very O
good O
for O
us H
who O
eat O
meat N
. O

That O
's H
all O
. O

So O
, O
yeah O
, O
OK O
. O

Eighty O
dollars N
. O

So O
, O
if O
they O
left O
the O
cat A
in O
the O
box N
, O
that O
cat A
will O
be O
die O
. O

can O
I H
reserve O
ticket N
of O
a O
super O
express O
? O
? O

so O
usually O
. O

very O
much O
. O

if O
I H
go O
to O
the O
Tokyo O
. O

My H
skin N
is O
so O
weak O
. O

Playing O
piano N
. O

Thank O
you H
so O
much O
. O

And O
, O
yeah O
, O
she O
likes O
to O
listen O
the O
music N
and O
send O
a O
mail N
or O
use H
a O
computer N
. O

Thank O
you H
. O

And O
I H
thought O
this O
school N
would O
be O
like O
the O
best O
school N
for O
me H
to O
develop O
my H
English O
skill N
. O

I H
liked O
it O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
mountain N
, O
and O
there O
are O
snow N
, O
and O
people N
are O
skiing O
. O

So O
, O
after O
using O
computer N
and O
sending O
e O
- O
mail N
, O
yes O
, O
of O
course N
, O
the O
no O
, O
communication N
style N
with O
the O
other O
people N
has O
changed O
by O
using O
the O
computer N
. O

So O
I H
do O
n't O
remember O
that O
I H
had O
kind N
of O
troubles N
in O
my H
shopping O
. O

My H
daughter H
? O

So O
I H
will O
buy O
it O
. O

So O
they O
want O
us H
to O
advertise O
I H
do O
n't O
know O
. O

And O
Bob H
asked O
the O
waiter H
have O
lunch N
with O
him O
we H
are O
two O
people N
. O

Do O
you H
know O
Okinawa O
Line O
? O

And O
so O
we H
got O
back O
into O
the O
car N
and O
we H
drove O
. O

I H
have O
a O
very O
important O
meeting N
. O

Like O

like O
to O

And O

For O

and O
I H
think O
I H
ordered O

how O
could O
I H
say O
, O
just O
I H
'd O
like O
to O
share O

things N
. O

You H

want O
to O

'd O
like O
to O

And O

I H
'm O

very O
well O
, O
but O
it O
is O
very O
nice O
city N

Junior O

go O
to O
a O
convenient O

is O
maybe O
night N

My H
second H

You H

Thank O

And O
, O
the O
someone H

at O
first O
, O
I H
should O
ride O
Tobu O
Tojo O

Ikebukuro O
and O
I H
change O
the O

to O
Yamanote O

Takadanobaba O
, O
finally O
I H
change O

and O
I H
come O

I H
'll O
get O

and O
get O

Shibuya O

. O

So O
Isetan O
or O
Mitsukoshi O
or O
Takashimaya O
. O

it O
was O
normal O
. O

having O
some O
good O
food N
, O

so O
he O
was O
the O
one N
who O
got O
into O
the O
ambulance N
and O
went O
with O
her O

So O
and O
they O
understand O
me H

I H
have O
a O
wife H
, O
and O
one N
son H
and O
one N
daughter H
. O

. O

Nice O

But O
it O

so O
instead O

, O
I H
'll O
take O
another O
sweater N
, O

bigger O
one N
. O

and O
then O
I H

But O
I H
do O

. O

And O
some O
people N
are O

and O
some O
are O
playing O

. O

Among O
five O
or O
six O

or O

my H
other O
clothes N
or O
like O
how O

wear O

recently O

got O
a O
job N

travel O
. O

Every O
Christmas H
we H
go O
Hawaii O
. O

Hokkaido O
noodle N
is O
delicious O
. O

And O
I H
think O
it O
's H
healthy O
. O

If O
possible O
. O

this O
girl H
is O
, O
I H
think O
she O
is O
in O
her O
room N
. O

almost O
I H
read O
magazine N
. O

but O
I H
missed O
the O
train N
by O
a O
small O
accident N
. O

So O
they O
usually O
go O
to O
a O
park N
. O

right O
now O
? O

I H
want O
it O

So O
that O
's H
one N
big O
thing N
. O

And O
so O
I H
could O
n't O
come O
here O
in O
time N
. O

and O
I H
have O
to O
clean O
up O
my H
room N
and O
so O
on O
. O

I H
'm O
very O
sorry O
. O

Then O
, O
we H
get O
together O
to O
study O
. O

But O
she O
always O
fail O
. O

Now O
can O
you H
get O
it O
for O
me H
? O

But O
Japanese O
environmental O
program N
is O
very O
bad O
. O

I H
'm O
on O
backyard N
trying O
to O
fix O
my H
car N
, O
but O
I H
ca O
n't O
. O

And O
all O
the O
tables N
are O
occupied O
by O
couples N

at O
night N
I H
played O
kendo O
. O

can O
I H
exchange O
the O
tickets N
? O

I H
was O
in O
very O
far O
place N
. O

But O
sometimes O
I H
go O
to O
drinking O
with O
my H
friend H
after O
our H
job N
. O

Do O
you H
know O
? O
" O

So O
he O
has O
his O
own O
drink N
, O
which O
is O
his O
usual O

And O
old O
gentleman H
is O
reading O
a O
newspaper N
outside O
on O
a O
bench N
. O

But O
I H
was O
so O
busy O
. O

For O
example N
, O
fishing N
, O
karaoke N
and O
convenience N
store N
, O
so O
on O
. O

The O
cat A
on O
the O
bed N
. O

OK O

the O
lady H

sitting O
in O
front N
of O
the O
desk N
. O

My H
name N
is O
Charlie H
. O

he O
was O
born O
when O
I H
was O
university N
student H
. O

So O
could O
you H
leave O
it O
with O
you H
, O
and O
please O
let O
me H
know O
if O
it O
is O

town N
. O

And O
teachers H
looks O
nervous O
. O

Or H
she O
has O
a O
relaxing O
time N
now O
. O

That O
's H
different O
thing N
I H
learned O
there O
. O

So O
if O
I H
use H
the O
super O
trains N
, O
or O
if O
I H
use H
the O
local O
trains N
? O

My H
home N
town N
? O

Thank O
you H
very O
much O
. O

just O
once O
a O
week N
, O
on O
Thursday O
, O
I H
teach O
English O
. O

And O
presently O
they O
crushed O
. O

J H
R H
? O

the O
textbooks N
are O
English O
. O

And O
then O
, O
I H
put O
some O
of O
these O
prepared O
things N
with O
rice N
without O
washing O
. O

" O
Silent O
Service O
" O
. O

but O
I H
ca O
n't O
go O
. O

Between O
Roppongi O
and O
Nogizaka O
. O

New H
Year O
's H
? O

And O
there O
are O
two O
other O
boys H
playing O
with O
a O
ball N
, O
seemingly O
playing O
volleyball N
. O

Actually O
, O
I H
used O
to O
live O
in O
like O
Kami O
- O
igusa O
. O

I H
want O
to O
wait N
at O
five O
at O
the O
evening N
. O

We H
do O
n't O
have O
that O
. O

I H
live O
in O
Okinawa O
. O

probably O
, O
this O
picture N
is O
the O
anywhere O
restaurant N
. O

only O
one N
person H
to O
join O
. O

And O
I H
can O
use H
stocks N
at O
skiing O
. O

So O
that O
totally O
different O
world N
. O

But O
I H
'm O
tired O
because O
I H
practice O
American O
football N
hard O
before O
today N
. O

I H
studying O
furniture N
and O
architect H
. O

Swimming N
and O
shopping O
. O

Winter H
sports N
, O

actually O
I H
have O
a O
plan N
to O
go O
with O
my H
mom H
to O
Shibuya O
to O
have O
lunch N
. O

I H
do O
. O

too O
bad O
. O

Maybe O
, O
three O

two O
hours N
. O

So O
there O
are O
four O
people N
in O
that O
car N
. O

So O
you H
ca O
n't O
miss O
it O
. O

Two O
are O
boys H
and O
a O
girl H
. O

there O
is O
a O
dog A
and O
cats A
. O

only O
me H
. O

Hello O
, O
Charlie H
. O

let O
's H
see O
. O

And O
you H
? O

Once O
a O
month N
. O

And O
storm N
came O
. O

And O
my H
grandma H
helps O
him O
. O

Can O
I H
talk O
to O
your H
manager H
then O
? O

It O
's H
OK O
? O

But O
I H
think O
it O
was O
the O
Canadian O
or O
from O
the O
States O
, O
did O
also O
well O
. O

So O
that O
's H
a O
big O
difference N
. O

But O
in O
my H
case N
I H
live O
in O
Kyoto O
in O
Chiba O
prefecture N
. O

I H
see O
. O

Thank O
you H
for O
inviting O
me H
. O

So O
can O
I H
talk O
to O
another O
person H
who O
is O
responsible O
for O
that O
? O

I H
do O
n't O
know O
, O
I H
just O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
. O

But O
before O
he O
could O
reach O
the O
bag N
, O
a O
train N
came O
and O
ran O
over O
his O
bag N
. O

In O
April O
. O

I H
understand O
the O
situation N
. O

thank O
you H
. O

Yes O
, O
I H
did O
. O

Most O
delicious O
pasta N
. O

We H
could O
n't O
enjoy O
it O
so O
much O
. O

Everything O
mixed O
. O

Keep O
me H
awake O
. O

Thirty O
thousand O
yen N
? O

Look O
like O
interesting O
building N
. O

maybe O
it O
was O
so O
crowded O
and O
movie N

Who O
I H
am O
? O

And O
we H
made O
lots N
of O
practical O
things N
. O
— O
cards N
and O
stuff N
. O

A H
little O
. O

if O
you H
travel O
by O
train N
, O
you H
can O
enjoy O
scenery N
but O
you H
must O
bring O
your H
baggage N
by O
yourself H
. O

Free O
time N
. O

My H
friend H
want O
to O
drive O
me H
. O

Not O
so O
convenient O
. O

is O
it O
possible O

I H
watch O
it O
. O

Yeah O
, O
thank O
you H
. O

And O
I H
could O
n't O
say O
" O
No O
. O
" O
. O

Thank O
you H
. O

And O
I H
like O
making O
. O

So O
at O
last O
, O
I H
admitted O
her O
to O
bring O
a O
dog A
to O
her O
home N
. O

But O
, O
maybe O
, O
in O
six O
months N
, O
I H
will O
change O
to O
the O
sales N
person H
. O

First O
I H
lived O
in O
a O
dormitory N
. O

Thank O
you H
. O

That O
's H
it O
. O

So O
I H
think O
the O
person H
who O
ride O
on O
the O
car N
did O
not O
compensate O
, O

People N
from O
all O
over O
the O
world N
. O

So O
I H
like O
temples N
and O
shrines N
. O

the O
woman H
had O
gone O
to O
the O
depart O
. O

My H
most O
favorite O
movie N
, O
, O
recently O
, O
so O
, O
is O
" O
Cube O
. O
" O
. O

I H
'm O
sorry O

Actually O
I H
live O
in O
Gifu O
now O
. O

He O
is O
nineteen O
. O

Thank O
you H
. O

nandakke O
wakannaissune O
. O

Thank O
you H
. O

So O
it O
's H
OK O
. O

So O
that O
's H
the O
good O
point N
. O

And O
they O
stayed O
there O
that O
night N
so O
they O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
get O
wet O
in O
the O
rain N
. O

And O
, O
right O
, O
will O
you H
have O
a O
lunch N
with O
somebody H
? O

The O
boy H
and O
girl H
go O
to O
the O
zoo N
at O
the O
Sunday O
. O

And O
I H
like O
musical N

There O
are O
five O
hundred O
thousand O
people N
live O
in O
Hiroshima O
City N
. O

and O
my H
wife H
, O
too O
. O

Nice O
to O
meet O
you H
. O

You H
are O
welcome O
. O

If O
it O
is O
a O
Valentine O
's H
Day H
, O
I H
will O
prepare O
dinner N
by O
myself H
. O

Even O
though O
I H
like O
skiing O
, O
I H
do O
n't O
like O
cold O
weather N
. O

They O
come O
on O
time N
every O
single O
day N
. O

you H
free O
time N
. O

and O
I H
have O
a O
lot N
of O
complains O
of O
my H
work N
. O

But O
it O
's H
raining O
. O

I H
sometimes O
play O
tennis N
with O
my H
friends H
. O

this O
is O
Charlie H
. O

do O
you H
have O
the O
blue O
one N
? O

So O
still O
I H
'm O
quite O
interested O
in O
taking O
lots N
of O
pictures N
. O

one N
woman H
walk O
her O
dog A
. O

I H
want O
to O
buy O
new O
clotheses N
, O
or O
pants N
, O
or O
shoes N
. O

Last O
restaurant N
, O
the O
end N
of O
the O
last O
year N
with O
my H
family H
, O
I H
went O
to O
Italian O
restaurant N
in O
Osaka O
. O

but O
in O
a O
telephone N
shopping O
. O

And O
they O
could O
n't O
meet O
each O
other O
. O

But O
it O
was O
very O
nice O
nature N
. O

I H
would O
definitely O
use H
a O
train N
. O

I H
like O
pizza N
, O
pasta N
, O
Chinese O
. O

it O
is O
the O
license N
of O
advising O
for O
customer H
's H
life N
plan N
. O

so O
we H
take O
the O
cat A
and O
went O
back O
to O
home N
. O

They O
arrived O
at O
the O
camping N
ground N
. O

or O
I H
can O
see O
some O
other O
supermarket N
or O
book O
shops N
, O
something O
like O
that O
. O

Fine O
, O
yes O
, O
please O
. O
" O
. O

I H
do O
n't O
know O
maybe O
people N
stress N
on O
freedom N
or O
other O
things N
. O

in O
U H
K O

I H
like O
dog A
. O

Six O
days N
a O
week N
. O

You H
're O
welcome O
. O

I H
like O
vivid O
color N
, O
so O
I H
want O
plastic N
or O
vinyl N
type N
. O

A H
four O
and O
seven O
. O

So O
, O
they O
were O
talking O
about O
a O
movie N
after O
movies N
. O

It O
's H
very O
exciting O
. O

I H
guess O
it O
's H
because O
I H
'm O
not O
good O
at O
it O
. O

Maybe O
, O
she O
works O
at O
home N
. O

But O
he O
did O
n't O
know O
which O
is O
the O
best O

but O
she O
kept O
begging O
to O
keep O
the O
cat A
, O
and O
, O
after O
that O
, O
I H
could O
not O
tell O
her O
that O
I H
did O
n't O
want O
a O
kitty A
to O
take O
to O
my H
home N
. O

but O
, O
Japanese O
people N
how O
can O
I H
say O
, O
tend O
to O
buy O
pets A
, O
based O
on O
the O
nante O
iukana O
trend N
. O

the O
Germany H
in O
summer N
has O
good O
weather N
and O
seldom O
rainy O
day N
. O

Hokkaido O
is O
nice O
place N
. O

it O
's H
computer N
is O
very O
easy O
use H
. O

I H
see O
. O

I H
intended O
to O
give O
you H
a O
call O
. O

I H
'm O
not O
good O
at O
cold O
. O

But O
the O
car N
driver H
said O
, O
" O
That O
's H
motorbike N
's H
fault N
. O

No O
, O
no O
, O
no O
, O
no O
, O
no O
. O

Have O
you H
heard O
Pittsburgh O
? O

And O
I H
just O
drived O
five O
minutes N
to O
check O
the O
car N
's H
condition N
. O

Then O
I H
came O
here O
. O

red O
sweater N
. O

While O
they O
were O
driving O
, O
they O
found O
one N
hotel N
called O
Cosmos O
. O

Tickets N
like O
what O
? O

But O
, O
finally O
, O
I H
got O
lot N
of O
foods N
in O
a O
car N
, O
and O
then O
I H
went O
back O
. O

It O
has O
a O
very O
nice O
background N
probably O
in O
culture N
. O

I H
do O
n't O
know O
how O
we H
are O
in O
there O
, O
but O
maybe O
we H
are O
with O
kids H

But O
they O
died O
. O

Fridays O
, O
Saturdays O
, O
Sundays O
. O

Commute N
system N
? O

yeah O
, O
in O
the O
field N
of O
anthropology N
. O

nice O
to O
meet O
you H
. O

and O
she O
has O
a O
cat A
and O
dogs A
and O
they O
are O
sleeping O
now O
. O

I H
have O
my H
two O
girls H
. O

And O
already O
you H
know O
, O
there O
's H
a O
casino N
in O
Osaka O
. O

So O
yeah O
, O
I H
choice N
a O
regular O
family H
restaurant N
, O
or O
yakiniku O
restaurant N
, O
or O
so O
. O

And O
at O
the O
same O
time N
, O
the O
other O
man H
was O
driving O
a O
bike N
making O
telephone N
call O
to O
his O
girlfriend H
. O

It O
was O
fantastic O
view N
. O

it O
was O
a O
brilliant O
beautiful O
day N
. O

so O
it O
's H
very O
, O
very O
convenient O
. O

Good O
afternoon N
. O

Actually O
this O
is O
my H
first O
time N
to O
go O
to O
Hawaii O
. O

But O
it O
was O
actually O
too O
small O
for O
me H
. O

And O
the O
monthly O
fee N
and O
there O
're O
like O
handling N
fee N
. O

our H
company N
's H
president H
, O
mister O
Hokkaido O
held O
the O
home N
party N
. O

my H
room N
is O
old O
house N
. O

I H
play O
with O
my H
friends H
. O

All O
right O
. O

They O
're O
playing O
a O
different O
groups N
right O
now O
. O

How O
about O
tomorrow N
? O

So O
most O
difficult O
thing N
is O
Japanese O
has O
many O
word N
same O
pronunciation N
. O

So O
I H
wanted O
to O
study O
that O
. O

And O
now O
he O
is O
talking O
about O
his O
child H
's H
score N
in O
his O
school N
. O

she O
enjoy O
shopping O
. O

I H
know O
that O
. O

Because O
I H
have O
to O
start O
driving O
from O
April O
. O

So O
I H
want O
to O
take O
a O
express O
train N
. O

I H
had O
a O
wide O
foot N
, O
but O
short O
size N
length N
. O

This O
is O
Charlie H
. O

Therefore O
they O
had O
to O
call O
the O
police N
. O

before O
next O
day N
is O
white O
day N
. O

But O
I H
still O
have O
this O
ticket N
. O

Thank O

for O
the O

. O

And O
after O
that O
they O
went O

home N
. O

not O
bad O
sister H
. O

And O
I H
paid O
and O
shopkeeper H
give O
it O
to O
me H
. O

But O
while O
I H
was O
in O
New H
York H
, O
after O
I H
left O
from O
Indianapolis O
when O
I H
went O
to O
New H
York H
to O
see O
my H
co O
- O
worker O
and O
my H
clients H
, O
and O
then O
I H
saw O
some O
Broadway O
Musical N
and O
, O
do O
you H
know O
Stump O

That O

And O
I H
can O
work N
for O
whole O
my H
life N
. O

I H
see O
many O
people N
there O
. O

so O
maybe O
I H
have O
to O
study O
. O

I H
think O
they O
are O
chatting O
about O
their O
child H
, O
I H
think O
. O

That O
's H
all O
. O

Or H
Daimaru O
. O

go O
shopping O
and O
play O
catch O
ball N
and O
ma O
play O

And O
they O
meet O
at O
twelve O
o'clock O
at O
the O

. O

do O
you H
go O
to O
theater N
with O

? O

finish O
watch O
the O
movie N
. O

one N
of O
my H

so O
I H
want O
to O

one N
day N
last O
week N
, O
there O
is O
a O
couple N
walking O
in O
the O
street N
. O

I H
could O
n't O
come O
up O
with O
a O
word N
. O

maybe O
I H
just O
feel O
a O
little O
bit N
better O
by O
seeing O
the O
animals A
or O
fish A
so O
they O
make O
me H
a O
little O
bit N
happier O
. O

All O
right O
. O

So O
the O
leader H
was O
already O
the O
leader H
right O
now O
in O
April O
. O

That O
's H
better O
than O
video N
. O

I H
know O
. O

My H
name N
is O
Charlie H
. O

Drinking O
wine N
. O

Once O
again O
? O

The O
time N
is O

o'clock O
. O

Thank O

. O

I H
usually O
have O
a O
lunch N
in O
my H
home N
. O

And O
there O
are O
many O
, O
many O
fishes A
, O
corals N
. O

And O
on O
the O
bench N
, O
man H
who O
is O
old O
is O
reading O
a O
newspaper N
. O

And O
there O
are O
actually O
three O
dogs A
in O
this O
picture N
. O

So O
and O
this O
is O
a O
autumn N
, O
autumn N

And O
some O
students H
are O
listening O
to O
the O
class N
eagerly O
while O
others O
are O
listening O
to O
the O
radio N
, O
or O
chewing O
the O
gum N
, O
or O
also O
chatting O
. O

It O
makes O
me H
out H
of O
stress N
. O

But O
their O
religion N
is O
different O
from O
Japanese O
one N
. O

After O
that O
, O
just O
do O
weight N
- O
lifting O
. O

big O
shop N
. O

Yes O
, O
I H
want O
to O
watching O
lion A
, O
tiger A
cheetah A
lion A
and O
cats A
rui O

and O
I H
like O
it O
very O
much O
. O

And O
Italian O
and O
French O
and O
Switzerland O
. O

One O
day N
last O
week N
, O
I H
mean O
one N
family H
planned O
to O
go O
to O
picnic N
. O

my H
mother H
works O
for O
another O
hospital N
, O
and O
today N
is O
her O
night N
shift N
. O

And O
also O
, O
I H
see O
a O
lot N
of O
people N
, O
especially O
, O
children H
playing O
around O
the O
house N
and O
two O
women H
having O
a O
chat N
on O
the O
road N
. O

So O
we H
can O
play O
punk N
rock N
music N
easily O
. O

I H
like O
train N
more O
because O
I H
can O
sleep O
. O

So O
this O
is O
only O
experience N
of O
myself H
, O
right O
? O

And O
I H
cooked O
fried O
egg A
and O
something O
. O

I H
would O
explain O
to O
the O
teacher H
that O
or O
I H
would O
call O
the O
teacher H
before O
the O
exam N
begins O
and O
then O
I H
would O
tell O
him O
that O
the O
train N
is O
late O
so O
I H
ca O
n't O
make O
it O
on O
time N
. O

Actually O
the O
connection N
was O
bad O
. O

When O
I H
was O
in O
college N
, O
I H
skied O
, O
how O
many O
times N
? O

My H
hobby N
is O
sports N
. O

And O
so O
if O
I H
miss O
that O
appointment N
, O
you H
know O
, O
it O
will O
be O
a O
big O
disadvantage N
for O
me H
to O
start O
recruiting O
. O

So O
he O
says O
" O
Are O
you H
OK O
? O
" O

call O
my H
owner H
and O
have O
her O
exchange O
that O
night N
. O

And O
, O
when O
she O
was O
going O
out H
, O
she O
looked O
sale N
for O
ladies H
' O
shoes N
and O
ladies H
' O
clothes N
. O

I H
know O
it O
's H
very O
sad O
. O

the O
turtle A
wants O
small O
fish A
or O
shrimp N
or O
dried O
fish A
. O

I H
mean O
, O
but O
we H
just O
got O
OK O
. O

She O
came O
home N
. O

my H
parents H
are O
both O
Japanese O
, O
so O
they O
wanted O
me H
to O
be O
able O
to O
speak O
Japanese O
. O

I H
like O
to O
see O
the O
mountains N
. O

And O
one N
dog A
on O
the O
floor N
. O

We H
have O
a O
party N
. O

the O
girl H
sitting O
on O
the O
chair N
, O
and O
points O
the O
computer N
. O

And O
we H
were O
supposed O
to O
get O
up O
early O
in O
the O
morning N
, O
and O
I H
went O
out H
to O
watch O
new O
year N
's H
sunrise N
. O

now O
I H
live O
in O
Tokyo O
by O
myself H
, O
so O
in O
my H
room N
I H
need O
to O
have O
dinner N
or O
breakfast N
by O
myself H
, O
so O
sometimes O
I H
feel O
lonely O
. O

And O
the O
the O
people N
who O
are O
enjoying O
skiing O
and O
snowboarding N
are O
only O
adults H
. O

we H
like O
Italian O
restaurant N
or O
Mexican O
restaurant N
. O

yeah O
, O
the O
rabbits A
' O
eyes N
seems O
to O
be O
kind N
. O

My H
husband H
is O
much O
younger O
than O
me H
. O

But O
I H
guess O
, O
I H
used O
every O
luckiness N
in O
that O
car N
accident N
. O

It O
was O
located O
in O
Tokyo O
, O
Tokyo O
Hokkaido O
, O
and O
I H
was O
there O

I H
'm O
shy O
to O
do O
this O
kind N
of O
thing N
in O
real O
life N
. O

I H
do O
n't O
like O
as O
well O
. O

This O
weekend N
? O

what O
time N
you H
available O
? O

I H
think O
this O
was O
so O
the O
Valentine O
Day H
is O
a O
good O
opportunity N
for O
them O
to O
show O
their O
love O
to O
the O
boys H
. O

I H
go O
to O
theater N
at O
afternoon N
. O

But O
my H
uncle H
drank O
a O
cup N
of O
wine N
. O

And O
I H
went O
only O
sightseeing O
spot N
. O

One O
is O
a O
tutor H
. O

I H
like O
wood N
and O
fresh O
air N
. O

when O
I H
arrived O
at O
home N
, O
it O
would O
be O
around O
six O
o'clock O
. O

No O
, O
no O
, O

, O

. O

That O
's H
a O
difficult O
one N
. O

However O
Steve H
no O
, O
he O
did O
n't O
avoid O
accident N
. O

End N
of O
the O
story N
. O

I H
'm O
pretty O
good O

Just O

And O
unfortunately O
, O
my H
baggage N
which O

. O

And O
we H
found O

great O
experience N
for O
me H
. O

Last O
, O
OK O
. O

There O
are O
many O
bus N
and O
trains N
, O
but O
, O
at O
least O
, O
when O
I H
consider O
my H
daughter H
, O
school N
and O
other O
public O
offices N
must O
be O
or O
should O
be O
closer O
for O
my H
daughter H
and O
my H
wife H
. O

I H
like O
used O
clothing N
. O

when O
the O

playing O
the O

the O
good O
point N

very O
good O
for O
physical O
and O
mental O
. O

And O
they O
speak O
the O
contents N
of O
the O
movie N
. O

Yes O
, O
I H
see O
. O

Like O
it O
's H
really O
cute O
. O

before O
I H
'm O
a O
transfer H
student H
to O
Harvard O
. O

And O
they O
moved O
eighteen O
years N
ago O
to O
America O
because O
of O
my H
father H
's H
company N
. O

So O
I H
decided O
to O
join O
the O
club N
. O

and O
not O
exact O
one N
hour N
. O

I H
like O
to O
have O
a O
dog A
. O

so O
I H
have O
strong O
memory N
. O

Ninety O
minutes N
. O

Because O
it O
was O
old O
building N
. O

And O
I H
eat O
her O
cook O
to O
dinner N
. O

in O
this O
season N
, O
near O
my H
house N
, O
a O
very O
beautiful O
. O

Yeah O
, O
no O
, O
no O
, O
no O
, O
no O
. O

And O
so O
of O
course N
, O
I H
reserve O
the O
morning N
ticket N
, O
but O
last O
night N
I H
had O
the O
party N
with O
my H
customer H
and O
my H
colleagues H

So O
it O
was O
February O

I H
enjoy O
it O
. O

but O
now O
, O
I H
'm O
looking O
for O
a O
bread N
for O
tomorrow N
's H
breakfast N
. O

And O
we H
packed O
up O
. O

And O
it O
's H
so O
fresh O
you H
know O
, O
not O
that O
dirty O
. O

After O
work N
, O
yes O
, O
I H
'm O
very O
happy O
to O
go O
home N
. O

but O
, O
in O
Hokkaido O
, O
I H
do O
n't O
have O
so O
many O
chances N
to O
eat O
such O
a O
delicious O
food N
. O

It O
could O
be O
that O
she O
has O
to O
have O
the O
infusion N
as O
I H
have O
experienced O
before O
. O

But O
I H
like O
to O
go O
jogging O
. O

If O
I H
keep O
an O
eye N
on O
them O
, O
I H
start O
to O
criticize O
. O

she O
has O
taught O
me H
a O
lot N
about O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
other O
people N
. O

So O
now O
, O
I H
sometimes O
go O
to O
the O
river N
side N
. O

tyotto O
matte O
nan O
daro O
is O
chotto O
wakan O

Credit N
analyst H
. O

Then O
we H
'll O
talk O
. O

, O
that O
's H
so O
he O
said O
. O

I H
like O
Shibuya O
very O
much O
. O

But O
actually O
it O
's H
sometimes O
very O
reluctant O
to O
listen O
to O
me H
or O

Platform N
number N
? O

I H
like O
them O
very O
much O
, O
and O
I H
really O

Japanese O
. O

express O

. O

's H
a O
sunny O

small O
nandaro O

my H

. O

Two O
hour N
. O

Nice O
to O

. O

actually O
, O
after O
I H
entered O
the O
university N
, O
I H
started O

. O

is O

two O
hour N
from O

In O
Summer N
. O

And O

But O
after O

, O
I H
was O
walking O
around O
the O
department N

. O

and O
we H
had O
very O
beautiful O
music N
. O

I H
do O
n't O
smoke O
with O
my H
family H
. O

in O
Tokyo O
ku O
. O

I H
think O
in O
American O
English O
, O
probably O
you H
do O
n't O
use H
the O
term N
for O
apartment N
for O
this O
skyscraper N
- O
like O
building N
. O

And O
, O
you H
know O
, O
I H
do O
n't O
have O
money N
right O
now O
, O
and O
I H
really O
need O
money N
or O
change O
it O
to O
another O
train N
. O

My H
hobby N
is O
to O
play O
soccer N
. O

She O
does O
n't O
like O
to O
make O
a O
lot N
of O
friends H
and O
talk O
but O

it O
's H
Hakone O
or O
Odawara O
. O

Because O
I H
had O
good O
sleep O
yesterday N
. O

but O
, O
and O
the O
person H
came O
with O
a O
truck N
and O
got O
this O
motorcycle N
to O
the O
repairing O
shop N

yeah O
, O
if O
they O
have O
children H
. O

No O
, O
not O
at O
all O
. O

So O
, O
when O
I H
'm O
with O
him O
, O
I H
can O
relax O
and O
, O
I H
can O
have O
kind N
of O
fun O
. O

Thank O
you H
very O
much O
. O

I H
live O
with O
my H
parents H
and O
grandfather H
. O

So O
it O
's H
a O
little O
bit N
sad O
for O
me H
. O

About O
him O
? O

And O
then O
that O
time N
, O
I H
forgot O
to O
call O
you H
. O

my H
hobby N
is O
playing O
sports N
. O

So O
you H
can O
talk O
to O
your H
boss A
. O

So O
right O
now O
, O
we H
are O
on O
winter N
vacation N
, O
but O
in O
the O
spring N
, O
it O
gets O
really O
warm O
, O
and O
from O
the O
doujou O
that O
we H
practice O
at O
, O
you H
can O
see O
the O
cherry N
blossoms N
really O
well O
. O

But O
you H
know O
, O
when O
I H
took O
it O
home N
, O
it O
did O
n't O
really O
match O
my H
other O
things N
. O

But O
the O
more O
of O
it O

So O
that O
's H
why O
I H
came O
back O
, O
and O
, O
you H
know O
, O

And O
I H
stayed O
there O
for O
about O
two O
weeks N
. O

Yes O
, O
with O
my H
family H
. O

It O
's H
really O
diverse O
. O

So O
I H
guess O
I H
usually O
decide O
where O
to O
go O
. O

And O
then O
the O
police N
came O
after O
that O

My H
parents H
said O
that O
it O
is O
very O
sad O
to O
look O
the O
pets A
when O
they O
die O
. O

What O
do O
I H
miss O
most O
about O
America O
? O

it O
's H
fair O
and O
blue O
skys N
. O

So O
, O
that O
is O
the O
best O
advantage N
to O
holding O
a O
pets A
. O

And O
but O
recently O
she O
has O
told O
me H
that O
she O
has O
gotten O
interested O
in O
using O
English O
and O
maybe O
she O
would O
like O
to O
continue O
learning O
English O
when O
she O
goes O
on O
to O
college N
. O

my H
father H
died O
seventeen O
years N
ago O
. O

maybe O
she O
said O
this O
was O
a O
present N
for O
her O
husband H
. O

Short H
story N
. O

Usually O
, O
we H
spend O
one N
day N
of O
weekends N
to O
go O
gymnastics N
and O
exercise N
. O

they O
go O
to O
, O
ka O
, O
a O
zoo N
. O

But O
, O
especially O
, O
she O
is O
good O
at O
meat N
loaf N
. O

First O
name N
. O

This O
year N
. O

I H
love O
Canada O
very O
much O
. O

And O
the O
door N
is O
opened O
. O

I H
'm O
doing O
great O
. O

I H
'm O
fine O
. O

And O
she O
checked O
on O
register N

So O
I H
have O
to O
go O
to O
the O
dentist H
and O
let O
him O
see O
it O
. O

And O
I H
usually O
dance O
on O
the O
school N
festival N
. O

usually O
, O
I H
do O
n't O
have O
any O
profession N
of O
my H
own O
, O
but O
I H
go O
to O
school N
in O
Tokyo O
which O
is O
the O
center N
of O
Kyoto O
, O
so O
it O
's H
quite O
away O
from O
where O
I H
live O
. O

I H
mean O
, O
he O
lives O
soccer N

No O
, O
I H
'm O
sorry O
. O

I H
like O
the O
history N
of O
England O
. O

And O
the O
man H
on O
a O
motorcycle N
came O
from O
the O
different O
direction N
and O
he O
was O
calling O
his O
girlfriend H
with O
his O
cellular O
phones N
. O

outside O
of O
town N
. O

We H
had O
almost O
stayed O
in O
hotel N
, O
and O
in O
among O
four O
days N
, O
we H
went O
to O
beach N
only O
one N
day N
. O

Thank O
you H
. O

I H
'm O
freshman H
. O

And O
the O
girls H
looks O
happily O
about O
this O
. O

this O
is O
a O
classroom N

and O
the O
student H
life N
there O
was O
very O
different O
. O

you H
mean O
with O
computer N
or O
hand N
writing N
? O

it O
is O
Italian O
restaurant N
. O

so O
I H
think O
it O
's H
very O
fast O
to O
the O
time N
pass O
. O

so O
I H
have O
a O
lot N
of O
assignment N
in O
my H
job N
. O

but O
the O
almost O
all O
of O
them O
do O
n't O
listen O
to O
what O
, O
the O
teacher H
said O
. O

So O
the O
classes N
were O
very O
strict O
atmosphere N
and O
a O
kind N
of O
strange O
, O
I H
think O
now O
. O

until O
I H
was O
a O
high O
school N
student H
, O
I H
lived O
in O
Hokkaido O
. O

One O
hour N
. O

And O
then O
, O
there O
is O
sorry O
, O
a O
audio N
set O
, O
and O
then O
, O
the O
single O
bed N
. O

And O
we H
put O
up O
the O
tent N
and O
tried O
to O
cook O
or O
started O
cooking O
something O
. O

So O
, O
next O
Saturday O
, O
twelve O
. O

Sometime O
, O
I H
hardly O
listen O
to O
the O
teachers H
, O
but O
someday O
I H
was O
boring O
very O
much O
of O
the O
teacher H
's H
lesson N
. O

I H
can O
drive O
. O

My H
name N
is O
Charlie H
. O

And O
then O
I H
move O
to O
the O
States O
nine O
or O
ten O
years N
ago O
. O

But O
skiing O
, O
it O
's H
two O
boards N
. O

Thanks N
, O
bye O
. O

And O
some O
good O
friends H
. O

I H
family H
restaurant N
. O

But O
everybody O
said O
it O
's H
kind N
of O
strict O
system N
. O

Thank O
you H
very O
much O
. O

Tenth N

I H

OK O
. O

No O
problem N
. O

And O
I H
was O
from O
France O
. O

thank O
you H
very O
much O
, O
and O
sorry O
. O

And O
a O
cat A
is O
sleeping O
on O
it O
. O

One O
day N
last O
week N
. O

Stuff N
like O
that O
. O

Thank O

. O

because O
I H
am O
graduate H
school N
student H
. O

and O
she O
sent O
our H
invitation N
letters N
of O
our H
wedding N
. O

My H
hobby N
is O
watching O

. O

Thank O
you H
. O

but O
I H
ca O
n't O
come O
. O

I H
usually O
go O
to O
Tokyo O
. O

thank O
you H
. O

but O
now O
, O
the O
job N
was O
finished O
. O

Thank O
you H
. O

Direct O
train N
. O

In O
Japanese O
, O
it O
is O
called O
sandan O
. O

I H
like O
French O
movies N

So O
, O
after O
that O
, O
we H
said O
good O
- O
bye O
each O
other O
and O
made O
a O
promise N
to O
see O
again O
in O
the O
near O
future N
. O

My H
parents H
and O
my H
younger O
brother H
. O

How O
many O
rooms N
? O

this O
is O
open O
this O
weekend N
. O

American O
carrots N
. O

I H
spent O
last O
Christmas H
with O
my H
girlfriend H
. O

Thank O
you H
. O

So O
, O
I H
think O
it O
's H
a O
big O
difference N
. O

I H
prefer O
Sendai O
. O

So O
I H
called O
the O
police N
, O
and O
explained O
to O
the O
policeman H
that O
, O
the O
was O
, O
mobile O
phone N
was O
the O
cause N
of O
the O
accident N
. O

Not O
so O
bad O
in O
Japan O
. O

I H
hope O
it O
will O
be O
successful O
. O

And O
I H
was O
having O
trouble N
with O
my H
boyfriend H
then O
. O

We H
can O
play O
very O
well O
. O

Last O
week N
, O
OK O
. O

I H
can O
see O
only O
one N
. O

transportation N
is O
not O
really O
covinient O
. O

Just O
a O
moment N
, O
please O
. O

very O
nice O
. O

one N
of O
the O
purpose N
, O
I H
guess O
. O

Yeah O
, O
like O
the O
food N
, O
like O
the O
set O
. O

So O
you H
should O
have O
explain O
it O
beforehand O
. O

Some O
people N
skiing O
. O

This O
weekend N
. O

But O
I H
take O
a O
next O
one N
, O
and O
I H
made O
it O
in O
time N
. O

I H
'm O
sorry O
. O

she O
use H
computer N
on O
the O
desk N
. O

But O
after O
I H
got O
home N
, O
I H
thought O
, O
you H
know O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
exact O
thing N
I H
was O
looking O
for O
. O

After O
that O
, O
she O
cooked O
egg A
's H
foods N
. O

And O
father H
, O
mother H
, O
and O
old O
brother H
. O

and O
she O
bought O
her O
clothes N
. O

yami O
- O
nabe O
is O
a O
kind N
of O
strange O
nabe O
, O
I H
think O
because O
— O

So O
, O
you H
know O
, O
it O
's H
not O
nice O
to O
have O
you H
contact O
Cindy H
for O
me H
. O

I H
ate O
a O
lots N
. O

And O
suddenly O
, O
the O
train N
came O
. O

Real O
doll N
. O

No O
, O
no O
. O

I H
want O
to O
have O
a O
big O
T H
V. O

And O
we H
prepared O
for O
the O
camp N
and O
preparing O
part N
was O
really O
fun O
. O

I H
went O
to O
the O
movies N
with O
my H
two O
friends H
. O

And O
, O
in O
college N
, O
I H
started O
thinking O
about O
my H
future N
. O

I H
make O
an O
effort N
to O
solve O
cusotmers O
' O
problem N
and O
when O
I H
find O
the O
correct O
way N
to O
solve O
the O
problem N
I H
'm O
very O
happy O
. O

And O
I H
do O
n't O
know O
actually O
what O
she O
is O
doing O
. O

and O
so O
I H
have O
to O
have O
to O
make O
some O
documents N
. O

And O
it O
's H
safety N
but O
food N
is O
terrible O
. O

But O
of O
course N
I H
have O
n't O
worn O
yet O
, O
and O
I H
have O
original O
receipt N
. O

and O
I H
'm O
thinking O
that O
that O
kind N
of O
goods N
would O
be O
suitable O
for O
one N
I H
'm O
giving O
to O
or O
not O
. O

Two O
years N
. O

I H
was O
there O
. O

Last O
time N

But O
you H
can O
just O
take O

Because O
I H
was O
in O

England O
six O
or O
seven O
months N
and O
studied O
English O
conversation N
and O
histories N
, O
and O
just O
almost O
I H
learned O
conversations N
. O

There O
is O
a O
entertainment N
system N
. O

There O
are O
four O
trees A
. O

Such O
as O

. O

I H
'm O

But O

But O
I H
just O

that O
I H

Doing O

And O

And O
I H

And O
the O
lion A
was O
watching O
them O
. O

No O
, O
I H
do O
n't O
, O
I H
think O
. O

In O
high O
school N
? O

it O
's H
very O
nice O
memory N
when O
I H
was O
in O
Switzerland O
, O
yes O
, O
I H
enjoyed O
skiing O
in O
a O
very O
local O
ski N
ground N
, O
yeah O
, O
with O
people N

And O
a O
couple N
wears O
a O
very O
formal O
dresses N
. O

And O
then O
, O
she O
went O
to O
another O
part N
of O
the O
department N
store N
. O

Thank O
you H
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand N
, O
the O
wife H
looks O
to O
be O
very O
cute O
. O

So O
policeman H
came O
to O
listen O
them O
. O

, O
I H
think O
cat A
. O

I H
go O
to O
Daikanyama O
and O
Harajuku O
. O

But O
the O
Ken H
said O
, O
" O
I H

because O
our H
apartment N
owner H
does O
n't O

" O

They O

. O

He O

, O
and O
he O
will O
go O
to O
take O

to O
her O
house N
. O

two O
ticket N
please O
. O

So O
my H
apartment N
is O
security N
is O
very O
good O
. O

So O
they O
were O
thinking O
about O
where O
they O
can O
go O
. O

I H
just O
can O
relax O
with O
my H
dog A
. O

So O
I H
'm O
gon O
na O
call O
them O
. O

When O
we H
got O
out H
, O
we H
talked O
a O
little O
more O

So O
I H
had O
to O
prepare O
for O
dinner N
. O

So O
I H
moved O
into O
Osaka O
. O

But O
since O
my H
brother H
is O
in O
Hiroshima O
and O
then O
my H
father H
, O
he O
was O
away O
from O
home N
. O

Yes O
, O
I H
do O
. O

I H
usually O
I H
mean O
, O
try O
to O
talk O
like O
why O
you H
think O
so O

but O
that O
time N
was O
the O
first O
time N
when O
I H
had O
these O
kitties N
. O

Three O
o'clock O
? O

And O
they O
prepared O
for O
watching O
a O
movie N
. O

Near O
the O
Kichijoji O
, O
there O
is O
the O
Tokyu O
department N
. O

big O
dogs A
, O
or O
small O
dogs A
. O

So O
, O
could O
you H
tell O
me H
the O
hours N
, O
I H
mean O
flight N
hours N
from O
Japan O
to O
Pakistan O
? O

And O
the O
kids H
are O
playing O
snowball A
. O

He O
agreed O
with O
her O
. O

But O
it O
's H
six O
time N
dattakana O

I H
'm O
a O
little O
bit N
nervous O
. O

So O
I H
have O
to O
do O
tonight N
. O

she O
cooked O
fried O
eggs N
and O
cook O
stew N
. O

I H
do O
n't O
like O
busy O
places N
like O
Tokyo O
. O

they O
drink N
beer N
. O

But O
the O
place N
where O
I H
teach O
is O
evening N
classes N
, O

Free O
time N
? O

, O
so O
I H
decided O
to O
study O
English O
literature N
in O
Japan O
since O
I H
was O
going O
back O
to O
Japan O
. O

Could O
you H
arrange O
the O
plan N
? O

I H
make O
objects N
by O
iron N
and O
clothes N
and O
a O
lot N
of O
materials N
I H

. O

But O
my H
wedding N
is O

two O
weeks N
. O

In O
the O

The O
difference N
between O

concert N
hall N
is O
the O
live O

a O
smaller O
capacity N
, O
and O

so O
, O
before O
I H

. O

Besides O

. O

And O

of O
the O

And O
it O

a O
typical O
scene N
of O

school N
at O
this O
moment N
. O

If O
it O
's H

believe O
it O
, O
but O
if O
it O
's H
bad O
, O
I H
'll O

" O

" O

Two O
boys H
. O

Because O

friendly O
each O
other O
. O

I H
do O

have O
any O

Yes O
with O
my H
cell N
phone N
. O

I H
live O
in O
Hiroshima O
. O

And O
there O
are O
many O
couples N
so O
. O

OK O
, O
thank O
you H
very O
much O
. O
? O

so O
, O
in O
Brisbane O
, O
I H
went O
to O
Norton O
Island O
. O

I H
will O
have O
just O
relaxing O
time N
, O
I H
think O
. O

My H
mother H
made O
it O
so O
I H
could O
put O
into O
the O
microwave N
and O
just O
warm O
the O
— O
in O
it O
, O
set O
for O
my H
brother H
and O
father H
. O

But O
I H
've O
been O
sent O
to O
the O
Internet N
online O
company N
called O
ABC O
company N
, O
and O
I H
worked O
there O
for O
two O
years N
. O

So O
he O
lifted O
his O
arm N
quite O
hard O
and O
fast O
that O
the O
luggage N
that O
I H
was O
holding O
, O
it O
fell O
off O
to O
the O
wait N

I H
'm O
work N
in O
C N
A H
my H
job N
is O
technical O
support N
. O

so O

, O
I H
'm O
going O
to O
climb O
mountain N
. O

Especially O
bookstore N
or O
electrical O
store N
. O

In O

stock N
? O

see O

" O
After O

are O
very O
famous O
Japanese O
restaurant N
and O
there O
— O
" O
. O

Just O

And O
if O
they O
would O
get O
a O
good O
business N
they O
expand O
to O
the O
other O
places N
to O
the O
branches N
. O

And O
among O
all O
these O
other O
people N
. O

So O

do O
you H
know O
the O
city N
name N
of O

teaches O
is O
not O
that O
good O
at O
all O
. O

And O
, O
yes O
, O
this O
is O
the O
end N
of O
story N
. O

My H
name N
is O
Charlie H
. O

after O
they O
finished O
lunch N
, O
they O
went O
to O
the O
cashier H
to O
pay O
for O
the O
meal N
. O

Next O
time N
they O
buy O
popcorn A
and O

. O

Takahagi O

many O
times N
do O

New H
York H

? O

OK O

. O

I H
'm O
ready O
. O

In O
autumn N
? O

do O
you H
know O
the O
Cinema O
Shibuya O
? O

Just O
go O
to O
beach N
and O
sit O
aside O
you H
know O
, O
the O
street N
and O
see O
the O
ocean N
. O

And O
very O
romantic O
. O

But O
I H
love O
dogs A
than O
I H
love O
cats A
. O

And O
I H
'm O
interesting O
to O
eat O
something O
for O
me H
. O

to O
go O
there O
. O

All O
right O
. O

And O
, O
another O
time N
, O
while O
I H
was O
parking O
hit O
another O
car N
very O
sligh O
slim O
, O
but O
still O
damaged O
. O

But O
she O
said O
even O
though O
she O
could O
n't O
get O
on O
the O
shinkansen O
train N
, O
her O
ticket N
will O
be O
changed O
to O
next O
train N
. O

But O
those O
two O
got O
totally O
different O
personalities N
. O

I H
really O
liked O
the O
bird A

So O
I H
decided O
to O
go O
to O
supermarket N
to O
buy O
the O
foods N
. O

and O
it O
was O
quite O
embarrassing O
. O

One O
day N
last O
week N
, O
young O
man H
was O
driving O
his O
car N
. O

By O
metro N
. O

So O
I H
'll O
call O
him O
right O
now O
. O

in O
Ayutthaya O
, O
there O
were O
many O
old O
things N
. O

It O
's H
OK O
. O

Because O
I H
went O
to O
girls H
school N

But O
how O
could O
I H
help O
it O
? O

to O
prevent O
. O

At O
that O
time N
, O
a O
girl H
has O
a O
soft O
cream N
. O

I H
am O
shopping O
food N
fruits N
or O
clothes N
. O

was O
for O
her O
husband H

's H
so O
cold O
. O

And O
I H
'll O
give O
you H
my H
phone N
number N
. O

And O
sorry O
, O
her O
boyfriend H
caught O
some O
sounds N
, O
mew O
, O

. O

Actually O
, O
we H
have O
to O
put O
a O
lot N
of O
equipments N
on O
our H
body N
, O
and O
it O
's H
heavy O
. O

Is O
that O
OK O
? O

But O
each O
does O
n't O
meet O
. O

So O
I H
could O
n't O
take O
. O

it O
's H
in O
Chiba O
. O

How O
much O
is O
the O
monthly O

I H
say O

Come O

So O
my H
lesson N
is O

. O

I H
read O

and O
very O
excited O
. O

Good O

that O
's H
right O
. O

I H
have O
two O
boys H
. O

In O
my H
case N
Ginza O
Mitsukoshi O
or O
Shinjuku O
Isetan O
. O

but O
when O

remained O

the O

. O

And O
she O

of O
a O
restaurant N
. O

but O
I H
did O
not O
have O
a O
very O
good O
experience N
in O
there O
. O

So O
, O
is O
it O
OK O
if O
I H
come O

around O
six O
o'clock O
? O

so O
, O
nandarou O

The O
other O
time N
I H
made O

called O
Kyoto O
. O

I H

computer N
, O
but O
there O

a O
T H
V. O

But O
when O

But O
if O

you H

I H

I H

of O
what O
should O
I H
say O
, O
tour N
ticket N
and O
official O
point N
. O

plastic N
bag N
? O

So O
I H
went O
to O
supermarket N
by O
my H
green O
small O
car N
. O

but O
there O
was O
a O
traffic N
accident N
near O
the O

. O

And O
so O
I H
ca O
n't O
count O
on O
just O
myself H
doing O
without O

. O

You H
're O
welcome O
. O

I H
play O

there O

. O

bigger O
or O

Saying O

about O
two O

so O
I H
go O

. O

walking O
around O

If O
we H
were O
doing O

, O
they O
would O
point N

the O
problems N
. O

I H

And O

. O

But O

say O
" O

One O
day N
last O

and O
she O
bought O

present N
. O

twice O
a O
month N
. O

Daikanyama O
, O
Aoyama O
, O
Harajuku O
. O

until O
I H
graduated O
high O
school N
I H
thought O
that O
I H
was O
playing O
soccer N
, O
for O
about O
more O
than O
ten O
years N

I H
like O
tennis N
. O

I H
go O

once O
a O
week N
. O

Rag O
Tag O
. O

I H
think O
more O
strong O
striker H
. O

I H
think O
I H
was O
eight O
in O
... O

Next O
, O
we H
go O
to O
monkey A
place N
. O

you H
can O
always O
change O
a O
policy N
for O
me H
. O

We H
have O
a O
lot N
of O
snow N
in O
winter N
season N
. O

I H
'm O
so O
sorry O
about O
that O
. O

and O
I H
'm O
sorry O
that O
I H
ca O
n't O
come O

I H
buy O
a O
ticket N
cheaper O
ticket N
. O

So O
I H
play O
cello N
. O

usually O
we H
go O
to O
shopping O
near O
the O
supermarket N
. O

And O
she O
wanted O
to O
look O
it O
, O
and O
tried O
. O

because O
the O
man H
who O
driving O
car N
did O
n't O
checked O
around O
. O

Last O
movie N
? O

I H
'm O
not O
interested O
in O
lunch N
chain N
. O

So O
they O
take O
care N
of O
me H
. O

And O
, O
even O
though O
she O
is O
really O
busy O
, O
she O
is O
really O
happy O
with O
them O
. O

It O
would O
be O
a O
kind N
of O
trash N
. O

I H
ca O
n't O
. O

And O
she O
was O
eating O
ice N
cream N
. O

And O
seems O
like O
I H
ca O
n't O
even O
get O
up O
out H
of O
bed N
. O

No O
, O
I H
did O
n't O
wear O
uniform N
. O

but O
, O
yes O
, O
she O
was O
OK O
. O

Thank O
you H
. O

So O
that O
's H
what O
I H
do O
for O
my H
spare O
time N
to O
relieve O
myself H
or O
to O
go O
refresh O
up O
a O
little O
from O
life N
and O
work N
. O

it O
's H
Sunday O
and O
the O
father H
is O
running O
to O
get O
some O
exercise N
because O
he O
gained O
weight N
lately O
. O

Actually O
, O
this O
week N
end N
, O
so O
it O
's H
our H
marriage N
anniversary N
. O

So O
and O
one N
year N
ago O
, O
interests N
was O
cheaper O
than O
now O
, O
and O
analyst H
said O
current O
interests N
is O
lowest O
. O

I H
want O
to O
watch O
soccer N
game N
in O
Germany H
, O
but O
I H
do O
n't O
know O
the O
team N
names N
and O
detail N
in O
Germany H
's H
soccers N
. O

So O
I H
'd O
love O
to O
go O
especially O
for O
England O
because O
I H
have O
friend H
there O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
like O
zoo N
. O

It O
's H
capital N
of O
Gifu O
. O

And O
there O
, O
I H
spent O
four O
years N

But O
it O
's H
not O
that O
kind N
of O
town N
. O

So O
last O
year N
, O
I H
enjoyed O
basketball N
once O
or O
twice O
a O
week N
. O

I H
'm O
fine O
, O
thank O
you H
. O

I H
went O
to O
shopping O
with O
my H
friends H
that O
I H
met O
in O
university N
, O
and O
I H
bought O
many O
clothes N
because O
the O
clothes N
I H
used O
to O
wear O
in O
the O
university N
was O
like O
jeans N
, O
so O
I H
ca O
n't O
wear O
it O
in O
the O
office N
. O

and O
I H
thought O
that O
maybe O
they O
did O
n't O
have O
time N
to O
do O
it O
in O
their O
homes N
or O
something O
. O

I H
often O
use H
VISA O
card N
. O

twenty O
minutes N
before O
the O
disaster N
. O

And O
my H
mother H
want O
to O
go O
sightseeing O
oversea O
. O

I H
live O
in O
Saginomiya O
, O
Seibu O
Shinjuku O
Line O
. O

I H
usually O
read O
magazine N
. O

But O
, O
now O
, O
ABC O
company N
decided O
to O
leave O
some O
stocks N
. O

she O
do O
n't O
see O
her O
face N
. O

So O
it O
takes O
about O
two O
hours N
from O
my H
house N
to O
my H
parents H
' O
house N
by O
car N
. O

I H
went O
to O
ski N
with O
my H
coworkers O
and O
enjoy O
skiing O
and O
drinking O
. O

because O
it O
's H
very O
good O
for O
stressing O
out H
. O

But O
other O
students H
have O
no O
intention N
to O
study O
. O

But O
they O
are O
think O
so O
. O

So O
they O
wanted O
me H
to O
take O
them O
to O
the O
baseball N
. O

So O
she O
is O
now O
busy O
, O
so O
, O
she O
ca O
n't O
get O
wedding N
. O

And O
my H
heart N
is O
full O
of O
something O
. O
? O

So O
I H
thought O
it O
was O
my H
size N
. O

Last O
December O
, O
she O
started O
to O
walk O
. O

and O
I H
'm O
reading O
books N
or O
cooking O
or O
so O
. O

does O
it O
... O
? O

I H
've O
never O
been O
dinner N
party N
. O

The O
train N
comes O
. O

when O
you H
sit O
down O
on O
the O
chairs N
, O
and O
also O
take O
off O
the O
chairs N
, O
some O
beginners H
get O
the O
poles N
stuck O
on O
the O
snow N
, O
and O
some O
people N
really O
getting O
trouble N
sticking O
on O
the O
poles N
and O
your H
body N
stuck O
on O
the O
poles N
, O
and O
finally O
chairs N
stop N
. O

My H
name N
is O
Charlie H
. O

You H
too O
. O

food N
is O
so O
good O
for O
us H
. O

we H
are O
from O
one N
school N
and O
we H
have O
like O
unity N
in O
our H
school N
. O

That O
's H
all O
. O

This O
was O
n't O
what O
I H
wanted O
. O

But O
where O
is O
Tanaka H
san O
now O
? O

Or H
because O
I H
play O
the O
guitar N
, O
I H
like O
Pat H
Martin H
or O
George H
Benson H
. O

And O
I H
can O
see O
a O
house N
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
picture N
. O

and O
I H
think O
there O
's H
only O
one N
person H
who O
's H
really O
actually O
listening O
to O
the O
teacher H
. O

One O
day N
last O
week N
, O
it O
was O
raining O
. O

when O
the O
movie N
finished O
, O
we H
were O
very O
enjoyed O
. O

My H
family H

atmosphere N

A H

And O

had O
the O

science N

. O

And O
there O
is O
a O

there O
, O
and O
a O

and O
a O

. O

My H
