Yes O
, O
Mr N
Evans H
, O
I H
feel O
an O
initiative N
of O
the O
type N
you H
have O
just O
suggested O
would O
be O
entirely O
appropriate O
. O

I H
would O
ask O
that O
they O
reconsider O
, O
since O
this O
is O
not O
the O
case N
. O

Transport N
safety N
has O
sadly O
been O
in O
the O
news N
recently O
: O

Needless O
to O
say O
, O
safety N
on O
roads N
, O
railways N
and O
inland O
waterways N
is O
of O
key N
importance N
and O
, O
given O
the O
international O
nature N
of O
these O
types N
of O
transport O
, O
training N
for O
safety N
advisors H
should O
also O
be O
harmonised O
, O
therefore O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
requirements N
of O
the O
new O
ADR O
, O
for O
example N
, O
which O
is O
under O
way N
. O

This O
is O
not O
just O
the O
fault N
of O
the O
Commission N
, O
but O
I H
believe O
that O
we H
need O
to O
take O
action N
more O
quickly O
so O
as O
to O
achieve O
harmonisation N
in O
this O
area N
as O
well O
. O

I H
can O
live O
with O
these O
minimum N
standards N
, O
but O
I H
would O
ask O
the O
Commission N
to O
monitor O
the O
situation N
very O
carefully O
. O

But O
I H
believe O
that O
we H
should O
do O
all O
we H
can O
to O
keep O
the O
transport O
of O
dangerous O
goods N
to O
a O
minimum N
, O
in O
all O
countries N
, O
whether O
they O
are O
transit N
countries N
or O
not O
. O

I H
hope O
my O
proposal N
will O
be O
taken O
into O
consideration N
in O
tomorrow N
's O
vote N
. O

I H
would O
like O
to O
ask O
the O
Vice N
- O
President H
if O
she O
is O
in O
a O
position N
to O
tell O
us H
today N
what O
the O
state N
of O
play N
is O
with O
regard N
to O
the O
efforts N
towards O
harmonisation N
being O
made O
by O
these O
two O
organisations N
, O
and O
whether O
the O
EU O
is O
in O
a O
position N
to O
hasten O
these O
harmonisation N
efforts N
, O
in O
accordance N
with O
principles N
that O
are O
as O
simple O
as O
possible O
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
I H
would O
very O
much O
like O
to O
thank O
Mrs N
Schroedter O
for O
the O
work O
she O
has O
done O
on O
this O
and O
to O
explain O
to O
colleagues H
that O
I H
am O
speaking O
for O
my O
colleague H
, O
Mrs N
Flautre O
, O
who O
followed O
this O
for O
the O
Committee N
on O
Employment N
and O
Social O
Affairs O
but O
who O
is O
unfortunately O
ill O
. O

But O
the O
lack N
of O
specific O
guidelines N
here O
is O
particularly O
to O
be O
regretted O
, O
as O
the O
idea N
of O
linking O
Social O
Fund O
assistance N
to O
the O
employment N
strategy N
will O
be O
put O
into O
effect N
for O
the O
first O
time N
during O
the O
2000 O
- O
2006 O
programme N
. O

The O
truth N
of O
the O
matter N
though O
is O
that O
we H
believe O
- O
and O
this O
is O
also O
shown O
in O
the O
way N
the O
conclusions N
have O
been O
drafted O
- O
that O
the O
Commission N
must O
take O
account N
of O
what O
is O
adopted O
by O
this O
Parliament N
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
face N
of O
an O
interim O
revision N
of O
these O
Directives N
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
Commissioner H
, O
I H
would O
like O
to O
thank O
Mrs N
Schroedter O
for O
an O
excellent O
report N
. O

She O
has O
gone O
into O
the O
issue N
in O
some O
depth N
and O
in O
the O
committee N
debate N
she O
took O
account N
of O
many O
of O
the O
amendments N
that O
have O
been O
tabled O
regarding O
this O
report N
. O

It O
contained O
details N
and O
issues N
that O
had O
already O
been O
raised O
in O
previous O
reports O
. O

This O
has O
been O
an O
ongoing O
concern N
for O
the O
five O
years N
that O
I H
have O
been O
a O
Member N
of O
this O
Parliament N
, O
and O
I H
have O
raised O
the O
issue N
time N
and O
time N
again O
. O

Consequently O
, O
I H
feel O
we H
must O
look O
to O
the O
future N
and O
establish O
guidelines N
for O
the O
mid O
- O
term N
review N
in O
2003 O
, O
and O
thus O
have O
an O
influence N
on O
the O
second O
phase N
of O
programming N
set O
to O
follow O
2003 O
. O

Its O
implementation N
would O
certainly O
require O
extending O
the O
scope N
of O
redistribution N
instruments N
such O
as O
the O
Structural O
Funds N
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
I H
too O
would O
like O
to O
congratulate O
the O
rapporteur H
on O
her O
excellent O
work O
. O

I H
will O
conclude O
, O
Mr N
President H
, O
by O
saying O
that O
the O
failure N
of O
the O
Commission N
's O
communication N
to O
focus O
on O
territorial O
pacts N
and O
, O
especially O
, O
methods N
of O
combating O
unemployment N
among O
women H
and O
young O
people N
, O
is O
cause O
for O
serious O
concern N
. O

Annexes N
I H
to O
IX O

the O

shall O
form N

this O

The O
text N
of O
that O
Treaty N

drawn O
up O
in O
the O
Bulgarian O
and O
Romanian O
languages N
, O
shall O
be O
annexed O

this O

Those O

shall O
be O
authentic O
under O
the O

conditions N
as O
the O
texts N
of O
the O
Treaty N
referred O
to O
in O
the O
first O
paragraph N
, O
drawn O
up O
in O
the O
present O
languages N

As O
long O
as O
this O
Agreement O
is O
not O
yet O
concluded O
, O
insofar O
as O
it O
applies O
provisionally O
. O

A O
national O
base N
area N
for O
each O
producing O
Member N
State N
is O
hereby O
established O
. O

However O
, O
for O
France O
two O
base N
areas N
are O
established O
. O

A O
maximum N
guaranteed O
area N
of O
829229 O
ha O
is O
hereby O
established O
. O

If O
such O
a O
decision N
is O
taken O
before O
the O
date N
of O
accession N
, O
the O
decision N
will O
only O
come O
into O
effect N
upon O
the O
date N
of O
accession N
. O

the O
aid N
measures N
shall O
be O
communicated O
to O
the O
Commission N
within O
four O
months N
of O
the O
date N
of O
accession N
. O

This O
communication N
shall O
include O
information N
on O
the O
legal O
basis N
for O
each O
measure N
. O

After O
that O
date N
, O
any O
aid N
found O
to O
be O
incompatible O
with O
those O
guidelines N
shall O
be O
considered O
as O
new O
aid N
. O

The O
stocks N
referred O
to O
in O
paragraph N
1 O
shall O
be O
deducted O
from O
the O
quantity N
exceeding O
the O
normal O
carryover O
of O
stocks N
. O

Such O
companies N
bring O
technologically O
advanced O
imports N
and O
new O
management N
techniques N
that O
foster O
growth N
in O
domestic O
firms N
, O
while O
spurring O
industrial O
modernization N
. O

Medicine O
, O
however O
affordable O
, O
is O
of O
no O
value N
if O
no O
one O
is O
available O
to O
prescribe O
or O
administer O
it O
. O

Here O
, O
too O
, O
Germany O
should O
take O
the O
lead N
. O

And O
China O
relied O
heavily O
on O
the O
US O
dollar N
to O
anchor O
its O
undervalued O
currency N
, O
allowing O
it O
to O
boost O
its O
export O
competitiveness N
. O

In O
the O
end N
, O
however O
, O
this O
codependency O
was O
a O
marriage N
of O
convenience N
, O
not O
of O
love N
. O

If O
America O
remains O
stuck O
in O
its O
under O
- O
saving O
ways N
but O
finds O
itself O
without O
Chinese O
goods N
and O
capital N
, O
it O
will O
suffer O
higher O
inflation N
, O
rising O
interest N
rates N
, O
and O
a O
weaker O
dollar N
. O

Though O
the O
likely O
answer N
is O
yes O
, O
the O
downside N
risks N
seem O
higher O
than O
they O
did O
a O
few O
decades N
ago O
. O

All O
of O
these O
problems N
have O
solutions N
, O
at O
least O
in O
the O
short O
to O
medium N
run O
. O

Or O
perhaps O
this O
innovation N
is O
less O
significant O
than O
its O
enthusiasts H
believe O
. O

It O
is O
telling O
that O
most O
of O
the O
symposium N
's O
47 O
participants H
– O
influential O
public O
- O
and O
private O
- O
sector N
figures N
from O
around O
the O
world N
– O
were O
unaware O
of O
the O
extent N
to O
which O
a O
mother H
's O
nutrition N
affects O
her O
offspring H
's O
wellbeing N
. O

This O
reflects O
a O
fundamental O
failing N
on O
the O
part N
of O
the O
scientific O
community N
to O
relay O
relevant O
data N
to O
decision N
- O
makers H
. O

In O
South O
Korea O
, O
Japan O
, O
and O
elsewhere O
, O
developing O
and O
maximizing O
women H
's O
potential O
will O
require O
comprehensive O
education N
and O
labor N
- O
market N
reforms N
, O
as O
well O
as O
structural O
change O
, O
particularly O
on O
the O
services N
side N
of O
the O
economy N
. O

In O
the O
realm N
of O
international O
economics N
, O
being O
perceived O
as O
boring O
confers O
power N
to O
the O
extent N
that O
it O
allows O
major O
decisions N
to O
be O
made O
without O
a O
great O
deal N
of O
external O
scrutiny N
. O

Nothing O
good O
would O
ever O
happen O
– O
and O
certainly O
not O
for O
the O
US O
. O

These O
countries N
' O
global O
economic O
and O
financial O
significance N
has O
grown O
rapidly O
, O
yet O
they O
have O
relatively O
little O
representation N
at O
the O
Fund O
. O

A O
package N
of O
reforms N
has O
been O
agreed O
. O

In O
effect N
, O
the O
administration N
tried O
to O
make O
the O
IMF O
more O
interesting O
, O
particularly O
to O
encourage O
Republicans O
in O
the O
House N
of O
Representatives H
to O
support O
the O
reforms N
. O

The O
latest O
indications N
are O
that O
the O
Republicans O
will O
not O
be O
so O
enticed O
. O

Not O
an O
inch N
. O

And O
yet O
, O
as O
Ukrainians N
work O
to O
rebuild O
our O
country N
after O
Viktor H
Yanukovych O
's O
predatory O
rule N
, O
we H
are O
facing O
a O
new O
threat N
, O
in O
the O
form N
of O
a O
" O
peace N
offensive N
" O
– O
that O
old O
staple N
of O
Soviet O
diplomacy N
designed O
to O
undermine O
Western O
resolve O
. O

If O
there O
is O
no O
oppression N
of O
Russian O
speakers H
in O
Ukraine O
, O
there O
is O
no O
reason N
to O
change O
the O
country N
's O
political O
structure N
. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
genetic O
engineering N
, O
however O
, O
science N
seems O
to O
matter N
less O
than O
politics N
. O

After O
all O
, O
establishing O
a O
genuine O
fiscal O
union N
would O
require O
strong O
political O
commitment N
– O
and O
considerable O
legwork O
. O

His O
time N
at O
Vendôme O
is O
reflected O
in O
Louis H
Lambert H
, O
his O
1832 O
novel N
about O
a O
young O
boy H
studying O
at O
an O
Oratorian O
grammar N
school N
at O
Vendôme O
. O

as O
Robb O
explained O
: O

A O
symbolic O
inheritance N
. O

In O
the O
end N
, O
his O
health N
fails O
and O
he O
is O
consumed O
by O
his O
own O
confusion N
. O

Their O
length N
was O
not O
predetermined O
. O

His O
preferred O
method N
was O
to O
eat O
a O
light O
meal N
at O
five O
or O
six O
in O
the O
afternoon N
, O
then O
sleep O
until O
midnight N
. O

Although O
Balzac O
was O
" O
by O
turns N
a O
hermit H
and O
a O
vagrant H
" O
, O
he O
managed O
to O
stay O
connected O
to O
the O
social O
world N
which O
nourished O
his O
writing N
. O

His O
health N
deteriorated O
on O
the O
way N
, O
and O
Ewelina O
wrote O
to O
her O
daughter H
about O
Balzac O
being O
" O
in O
a O
state N
of O
extreme N
weakness N
" O
and O
" O
sweating O
profusely O
" O
. O

Balzac O
sought O
to O
present O
his O
characters N
as O
real O
people N
, O
neither O
fully O
good O
nor O
fully O
evil N
, O
but O
fully O
human O
. O

As O
he O
did O
with O
the O
people N
around O
him O
, O
Balzac O
studied O
these O
places O
in O
depth N
, O
traveling O
to O
remote O
locations N
and O
surveying O
notes N
that O
he O
had O
made O
on O
previous O
visits N
. O

" O
The O
artist H
of O
the O
Comédie O
Humaine O
, O
" O
he O
wrote O
, O
" O
is O
half O
smothered O
by O
the O
historian H
. O

" O
Balzac O
has O
received O
high O
praise N
from O
critics H
as O
diverse O
as O
Walter H
Benjamin H
and O
Camille H
Paglia O
. O

It O
is O
not O
known O
exactly O
when O
Shakespeare H
began O
writing N
, O
but O
contemporary O
allusions N
and O
records N
of O
performances N
show O
that O
several O
of O
his O
plays N
were O
on O
the O
London O
stage N
by O
1592 O
. O

Shakespeare H
was O
buried O
in O
the O
chancel N
of O
the O
Holy O
Trinity O
Church N
two O
days N
after O
his O
death N
. O

The O
epitaph N
carved O
into O
the O
stone N
slab N
covering O
his O
grave O
includes O
a O
curse N
against O
moving O
his O
bones N
, O
which O
was O
carefully O
avoided O
during O
restoration N
of O
the O
church N
in O
2008 O
. O

Shakespeare H
collaborated O
on O
two O
further O
surviving O
plays N
, O
Henry O
VIII O
and O
The O
Two O
Noble O
Kinsmen O
, O
probably O
with O
John H
Fletcher H
. O

After O
Hamlet O
, O
Shakespeare H
varied O
his O
poetic O
style N
further O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
more O
emotional O
passages N
of O
the O
late O
tragedies N
. O

In O
Shakespeare H
's O
late O
romances N
, O
he O
deliberately O
returned O
to O
a O
more O
artificial O
style N
, O
which O
emphasised O
the O
illusion N
of O
theatre N
. O

In O
the O
18 O
th O
and O
19 O
th O
centuries N
, O
his O
reputation N
also O
spread N
abroad O
. O

Only O
a O
small O
minority N
of O
academics H
believe O
there O
is O
reason N
to O
question N
the O
traditional O
attribution N
, O
but O
interest N
in O
the O
subject N
, O
particularly O
the O
Oxfordian O
theory N
of O
Shakespeare H
authorship N
, O
continues O
into O
the O
21 O
st O
century N
. O

And O
there O
are O
a O
big O
amusement N
park N

I H
have O
a O
little O
audio O
set O
. O

Do O
you H
have O
a O
cheaper O
one O
? O

My O
name N
is O
Charlie H
. O

so O
we H
decided O
that O
we H
should O
not O
stay O
there O
any O
more O
. O

I H
like O
to O
play N
soccer N
with O
children H
. O

And O
we H
're O
living O
in O
Okinawa O
. O

I H
cooked O
very O
delicious O
cook H
. O

All O
right O
. O

And O
I H
like O
him O
. O

So O
busy O
. O

Yeah O
, O
, O
no O
, O
no O
, O
no O
, O
this O
shoes N
was O
insured O
by O
the O
company N
, O
but O
I H
believed O
that O
but O
this O
is O
not O
good O
. O

So O
I H
said O
it O
was O
n't O
yuck O
at O
that O
time N
. O

I H
'm O
so O
sorry O
. O

And O
some O
his O
friends H
and O
I H
made O
a O
present O
for O
him O
, O
expensive O
pen N
. O

She O
nawatobi O

I H
explained O
about O
the O
total O
stories N
? O

I H
want O
to O
buy O
is O
very O
sharp O
style N
and O
blue O
colors N
, O
and O
it O
cost O
me O
about O
two O
thousand O
yen N
. O

They O
only O
sat O
down O
but O
when O
I H
went O
then O
teach O
and O
doing O
some O
activities N
, O
they O
are O
changing O
. O

of O
course O
, O
the O
scenery N
and O
the O
atmosphere N
is O
different O
. O

last O
week N
, O
I H
went O
for O
shopping O
at O
the O
department N
store N
in O
Saitama O
. O

And O
then O
, O
piano N
turned O
just O
my O
hobby N
. O

The O
same O
. O

But O
fortunately O
, O
his O
briefcase N
, O
yeah O
, O
stays O
just O
as O
it O
is O
. O

I H
think O
so O
. O

I H
think O
Hokkaido O
is O
a O
kind N
of O
suburb N
. O

I H
'm O
taking O
test O
in O
five O
minutes N
so O
I H
ca O
n't O
go O
. O

on O
weekend N
, O
I H
have O
a O
rich O
spare O
time N
. O

She O
's O
not O
teaching O
mathematics N
interesting O
. O

And O
man H
wear O
a O
yellow O
jacket N
and O
blue O
tie O
, O
and O
a O
woman H
wear O
pink O
dress N
. O

Thank O
you H
very O
much O
. O

I H
do O
n't O
like O
to O
drive O
in O
the O
city N
. O

Yes O
, O
I H
have O
my O
own O
room N
. O

But O
recently O
, O
I H
started O
snowboard O
. O

I H
do O
n't O
know O
. O

but O
you H
know O
, O

Thank O
you H
for O
your O
help O
. O

I H
live O
in O
Gifu O
. O

And O
before O
another O
train N
could O
come O
, O
the O
station N
master H
went O
down O
to O
the O
tracks N
and O
got O
the O
bag N
for O
him O
. O

what O
time N
will O
you H
come O
at O
the O
Osaka O
station N
? O

Which O
one O
to O
take O
? O

I H
live O
there O
for O
two O
years N
without O
a O
car N
. O

All O
right O
? O

So O
I H
thought O
that O
some O
of O
the O
American O
men H
are O
like O
Japanese O
men H
, O
I H
think O
. O

So O
I H
wanted O
to O
see O
that O
things N
. O

I H
like O
music N
very O
much O
. O

Could O
you H
talk O
to O
him O
and O
give O
me O
a O
call N
? O

So O
one O
day N
last O
week N
, O
my O
boyfriend H
was O
driving O
a O
car N
to O
go O
to O
his O
office N
. O

After O
that O
, O
I H
do O
my O
normal O
work O
at O
my O
desk N
. O

Yes O
, O
I H
do O
. O

And O
we H
just O
relax O
and O
had O
a O
cup N
of O
coffee N
. O

And O
it O
makes O
me O
feel O
so O
good O
. O

The O
door N
is O
opening O
. O

I H
see O
. O

Thank O
you H
very O
much O
. O

Just O
in O
the O
building O
so O
- O
called O
Shibuya O
Higashiguchi O
Building O
. O

because O
sorry O
. O
... O

would O
you H
just O
tell O
me O
why O
our O
hotel N
rooms N
were O
not O
ready O
at O
that O
time N
? O

One O
boy H

you H
're O
welcome O

Yes O
, O
all O
right O
. O

After O
all O
, O
her O
own O
gift N
was O
much O
bigger O
than O
her O
husband H
's O
gift N
. O

But O
I H
do O
n't O
like O
them O
and O
when O
I H
'm O
eating O
them O
, O
that O
means O
I H
'm O
killing O
more O
animals A
, O
you H
know O
, O
to O
provide O
because O
they O
provide O
. O

And O
I H
can O
look O
another O
two O
tables N
. O

Yeah O
, O
because O
, O
only O
one O
my O
friend H
. O

because O
my O
commute N
pass N
expired O
yesterday N
. O

And O
the O
relationship N
between O
teacher H
and O
students H
, O
I H
'd O
say O
in O
a O
way N
, O
has O
been O
destroyed O
. O

Personally O
I H
'll O
make O
a O
phone N
call N
to O
everybody O
and O
apologize O
. O

Favorite O
professessor O
? O

But O
, O
you H
know O
, O
I H
expected O
a O
lot N
about O
, O
you H
know O
, O
eating O
sushi N
but O
I H
could O
n't O
. O

So O
it O
's O
looks O
like O
a O
just O
a O
seasonal O
sale N
. O

But O
we H
are O
friendly O

But O
I H
really O
did O
n't O
know O
that O
. O

I H
like O
roses A
and O
some O
herbs A
. O

So O
, O
I H
started O
with O
playing O
golf N
. O

So O
I H
have O
to O
go O
home O
right O
now O
. O

so O
I H
decided O
to O
take O
some O
food N
to O
the O
party N

it O
's O
a O
very O
interesting O
experience N
for O
me O
. O

recently O
, O
I H
go O
to O
driving O
school N
. O

And O
when O
I H
snowboard O
, O
I H
can O
try O
to O
jump O
, O
and O
like O
go O
really O
fast O
. O

and O
and O
she O
said O
" O
Bye O
. O
" O

My O
father H
is O
work O
. O

But O
the O
beginning O
of O
this O
year N
, O
I H
went O
to O
the O
United O
States O
to O
study N
English N
for O
short O
for O
about O
a O
month N
. O

Yeah O
, O
for O
lunch N
. O

And O
also O
, O
I H
have O
to O
clean O
the O
room N
. O

And O
her O
name N
is O
Shinjuku O
. O

one O
day N
last O
week N
, O
I H
went O
to O
the O
station N
as O
normal O
to O
go O
to O
my O
work O
. O

He O
's O
a O
fifth O
grader H
in O
primary O
school N
. O

Let O
's O
see O
. O

and O
I H
dropped O
my O
bag N
on O
the O
rail N
. O

But O
you H
know O
, O
it O
's O
little O
bit N
boring O
. O

I H
work O
in O
honsha O
. O

And O
the O
design O
was O
a O
little O
bit N
too O
hot O
. O

Basically O
, O
I H
'm O
not O
good O
at O
cooking O
, O
so O
potluck N
party N
is O
fine O
to O
me O
. O

I H
usually O
surf O
internet N
. O

Maybe O
eleven O
. O

And O
there O
's O
a O
box N
and O
, O
some O
sound O
is O
coming O
from O
box N
. O

Yeah O
, O
she O
has O
her O
own O
room N
. O

So O
I H
asked O
him O
to O
just O
go O
down O
and O
pick O
up O
my O
bag N
. O

So O
that O
atmosphere N
makes O
people N
very O
comfortable O
. O

so O
please O
give O
me O
up O
. O

My O
name N
is O
Charlie H
. O

And O
so O
where O
can O
I H
get O
the O
ticket N
? O

Some O
of O
the O
concert N
halls N
do O
weld O
a O
led O
inside O
their O
wall N
which O
does O
not O
allow O
any O
reception N
of O
cellphones N
so O
might O
be O
a O
good O
idea N
if O
you H
seriously O
want O
to O
stop O
the O
passenger H
using O
cellphones N
. O

And O
I H
had O
to O
take O
care N
of O
her O
. O

the O
movie N
was O
very O
boring O
for O
me O
. O

I H
like O
bread N
and O
some O
meat N
foods N
. O

And O
she O
's O
really O
nice O
to O
me O
and O
like O
nice O
to O
all O
the O
people N
around O
her O
. O

all O
jazz N
. O

So O
, O
I H
like O
. O

but O
someone O
says O
actually O
I H
do O
n't O
know O
so O
much O
about O
the O
accident N
so O
much O
, O
but O
someone O
said O
so O
. O

I H
will O
take O
the O
ticket N
or O
something O
that O
it O
says O
it O
was O
late O
for O
these O
accidents N
, O
so O

he O
was O
new O
to O
our O
house N
at O
that O
time N

I H
'll O
take O
this O
. O

usually O
, O
I H
use O
for O
business N
. O

But O
yeah O
. O

this O
movie N
is O
very O
interesting O
. O

for O
example N
, O
the O
man H
close O
to O
the O
window N
is O
chewing O
gum N
, O
and O
he O
looks O
out O
of O
the O
class N
, O
and O
behind O
him O
, O
there O
are O
two O
girls H
, O
who O
are O
chatting O
with O
each O
other O
, O
and O
in O
the O
center N
of O
this O
class N
, O
there O
is O
one O
guy H
who O
is O
drinking N
and O
who O
is O
listening O
to O
the O
C N
D. O

And O
the O
police N
came O
. O

And O
maybe O
German O
people N
like O
to O
enjoy O
Japanese O
food N
. O
" O
. O

he O
explain O
her O
about O
lion A
. O

color O
is O
dark O
. O

For O
fun N
? O

And O
I H
do O
n't O
know O
if O
they O
're O
grown O
- O
ups O
or O
not O
, O
but O
a O
boy H
is O
just O
listening O
to O
the O
music N
by O
headphone N
and O
drinking N
something O
. O

I H
'm O
also O
free O
at O
that O
time N
. O

Then O
the O
train N
came O
and O
ran O
over O
my O
luggage N
. O

it O
's O
sunny O
day N
. O

However O
, O
he O
was O
n't O
concentrating O
on O
driving O
. O

if O
I H
am O
the O
victim H
, O
how O
I H
am O
going O
to O
pay O
, O
I H
'm O
going O
to O
use O
my O
money N

We O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
study N
so O
much O
. O

My O
hobby N
is O
to O
watch O
movies N
. O

she O
asked O
him O
to O
bring O
the O
cat A
to O
the O
hospital N
. O

and O
we H
came O
back N
last O
Thursday O
. O

You O
know O
, O
this O
company N
sells O
many O
shampoo N
and O
conditioner N
and O
... O
products N
, O
So O
for O
their O
marketing N
development N
, O
I H
contribute O
to O
the O
market N
research N
. O

yeah O
, O
she O
likes N
flowers N
. O

before O
that O
, O
I H
was O
a O
little O
bit N
like O
childish O
, O
but O
he O
taught O
me O
lots N
of O
things N
. O

Actually O
, O
I H
've O
tried O
very O
hard O
to O
catch O
that O
train N
but O
in O
the O
morning N
, O
my O
baby H
just O
cried O
out O
. O

I H
ca O
n't O
leave O
him O
alone O
at O
home O
. O

but O
I H
do O
n't O
think O
I H
'll O
be O
able O
to O
make O
it O
within O
the O
hour N
. O

And O
you H
need O
more O
balance N
to O
do O
skiing N
much O
more O
than O
tennis N
, O
I H
think O
. O

So O
it O
's O
interesting O
. O

But O
boy H
do O
n't O
like O
of O
the O
animal A
due O
to O
the O

and O
very O
big O
and O
very O
comfort N
is O
not O
good O
for O
study N
. O

And O
she O
was O
looking O
for O
her O
husband H
's O
birthday N
present O
. O

All O
right O
. O

the O
father H
pay O
for O
the O
lunch N
. O

because O
there O
is O
the O
car N
in O
my O
house N
. O

Hokkaido O
city N
, O
for O
six O
years N
. O

That O
's O
all O
. O

Korea O
is O
very O
cold O
in O
the O
March O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
people N
are O
related O
to O
my O
son H
's O
friends H
. O

Thank O
you H
very O
much O
. O

And O
the O
driver H
was O
making O
a O
phone N
call N
with O
his O
mobile O
phone N
. O

I H
can O
wait O
yes O
, O
OK O
. O

old O
architect H
. O
? O

Thank O
you H
very O
much O
. O

I H
have O
two O
children H
. O

So O
, O
you H
can O
even O
ski N
at O
night N
. O

No O
rules N
. O

And O
I H
do O
n't O
think O
I H
can O
go O
to O
the O
party N
this O
time N
. O

Sometimes O
they O
do O
n't O
come O
to O
us H
. O

however O
was O
empty O
. O

and O
I H
got O
off O
at O
a O
Saitama O
Station N

This O
is O
a O
town N
. O

The O
girl H
talking O
each O
other O
. O

And O
I H
started O
watching O
it O
together O
. O

I H
do O
n't O
have O
pasokon O
. O

The O
movie N
? O
" O

I H
went O
to O
Fuji O
jukai O
. O

And O
the O
movie N
starts O
from O
one O
P N
M O
to O
three O
P N
M. O
And O
three O
people N
, O
two O
boys H
and O
girls H
buy O
three O
coke N
and O
, O
maybe O
, O
two O
popcorns A
. O

It O
's O
very O
huge O
and O
it O
looks O
like O
a O
remains O
of O
old O
temples N
. O

I H
'm O
sorry O
. O

they O
stopped O
to O
talk O
front N
of O
lion A
. O

And O
I H
could O
n't O
drive O
in O
so O
my O
mom H
drove O
me O
to O
his O
house N
. O

But O
in O
Harvard O
University O
, O
you H
can O
see O
many O
, O
many O
kinds N
of O
people N
. O

So O
it O
was O
good O
time N
, O

What O
are O
you H
doing O
now O
? O

I H
was O
born O
in O
January O
. O

And O
I H
do O
n't O
have O
lunch N
yet O
. O

And O
also O
, O
when O
I H
talked O
to O
my O
friends H
, O
they O
would O
say O
, O
" O
Oh O
" O
. O

I H
like O
curry N
, O
Hamburg O
, O
and O
ramen O
. O

And O
, O
suddenly O
, O
the O
clouds N
were O
changing O
to O
the O
black O
, O
and O
it O
happen O
to O
rain N
. O

" O
Thank O
you H
very O
much O
. O
" O
. O

I H
'm O
from O
Ishikawa O
. O

They O
sleep O
. O

But O
in O
a O
department N
store N
, O
we H
can O
see O
and O
buy O
almost O
everything O
. O

she O
really O
likes N
to O
work O
house N
work O
. O

Many O
people N
are O
relaxed O
and O
the O
kids H
are O
playing O
the O
volleyball N
on O
the O
garden N
. O

But O
now O
I H
'm O
not O
sure O
what O
kind N
of O
job N
she O
has O
. O

So O
it O
's O
poor O
. O

But O
in O
Japan O
, O
they O
try O
to O
attend O
you H
and O
try O
to O
help O
you H
out O
when O
you H
do O
n't O
need O
any O
help O
. O

I H
'm O
sorry O
that O
I H
could O
n't O
attend O
the O
party N
last O
night N
, O
actually O
. O

I H
think O
it O
's O
a O
little O
exaggeration N
in O
the O
situation N
in O
the O
United O
States O
. O

So O
when O
she O
went O
out O
from O
the O
department N
store N
, O

Seattle O
is O
State N
? O

after O
the O
marriage N
, O
we H
have O
n't O
gone O
yet O
. O

my O
hobby N
is O
watching O
movies N
and O
walking O
around O
. O

I H
like O
curry N
rice N
. O

I H
like O
powder N
snow N
. O

Thank O
you H
. O

Lots N
of O
family N
restaurants N
. O

Yeah O
, O
I H
am O
a O
graduate O
school N
student H
, O
so O
, O
I H
do O
n't O
have O
to O
take O
a O
lot N
of O
lesson N
. O

it O
looked O
really O
fun N
. O

Yes O
, O
yes O
. O

And O
ended O
up O
in O
the O
hotel N
drinking N
coffee N
and O
looking O
at O
the O
mountains N
from O
there O
. O

how O
much O
is O
this O
necklace N
? O

She O
likes N
use O
computer N
. O

Two O
girls H
are O
planning O
to O
have O
a O
camp O
. O

, O
I H
tell O
them O
it O
's O
a O
potluck N
party N
. O

That O
's O
the O
only O
line N
. O

because O
I H
do O
n't O
clean O
so O
. O

It O
's O
very O
nice O
. O

she O
's O
very O
glad O
to O
get O
ice N
cream N
. O

Or O
the O
bright O
color O
, O

So O
I H
think O
I H
buy O
a O
nice O
cake N
at O
Osaka O
. O

So O
it O
's O
very O
natural O
thing N
. O

It O
's O
not O
great O
like O
Japan O
, O
or O
it O
's O
a O
small O
city N
. O

at O
the O
morning N
one O
day N
last O
week N
, O
my O
girlfriend H
phoned O
me O
. O

very O
big O
restaurant N
. O

And O
it O
was O
really O
exciting O
, O
you H
know O
, O
as O
a O
child H
. O

OK O
, O
thank O
you H
. O

But O
not O
my O
boy H
. O

Thank O
you H
. O

I H
'm O
gon O
na O
wait O
for O
him O
and O
then O
go O
home O
with O
him O
. O

I H
mean O
a O
mental O
kind N
of O
handicap N
, O
not O
physical O
only O
, O
I H
mean O
mental O
handicapped O
children H
can O
enjoy O
those O
sound O
, O
color O
. O

, O
I H
have O
never O
took O
part N
in O
, O
... O

And O
I H
know O
like O
it O
's O
not O
possible O
, O
but O
like O
I H
ca O
n't O
wear O
this O
. O

yes O
, O
I H
did O
. O

because O
I H
want O
to O
eat O
. O

He O
was O
driving O
his O
car N
to O
work O
. O

There O
is O
a O
house N
, O
and O
there O
is O
some O
women H
and O
some O
children H
. O

My O
name N
is O
Charlie H
. O

Escape N
The O
Room N
Employees H
, O
what O
is O
the O
weirdest O
thing N
you've O
you H
've O
seen O
someone O
do O
in O
one O
of O
the O
rooms N
? O

The O
most O
depressing O
shit N
I H
saw O
was O
a O
tired O
looking O
couple N
who O
brought O
in O
their O
bespectacled O
, O
NASA O
shirt N
wearing O
, O
8 O
year N
old O
geek H
of O
a O
son H
in O
to O
have O
some O
fun N
. O

The O
parents H
couldn't O
could O
n't O
have O
been O
more O
discouraging O
to O
him O
. O

He O
was O
excitedly O
bouncing O
around O
the O
room N
pointing O
out O
things N
that O
he O
thought O
were O
clues N
clues N
while O
the O
parents H
dismissed O
every O
idea N
he O
had O
and O
told O
him O
to O
stop O
getting O
so O
excited O
. O

The O
parents H
took O
charge N
and O
proceeded O
to O
ignore O
the O
obvious O
clues N
he O
was O
pointing O
out O
and O
spent O
most O
of O
the O
time N
pursuing O
dead O
ends N
. O

Sad O
part N
is O
his O
instincts N
were O
more O
often O
than O
not O
correct O
but O
his O
parents H
just O
didn't O
did O
n't O
listen O
and O
refused O
to O
let O
him O
explore O
and O
try O
stuff N
out O
. O

Hopefully O
his O
curiosity N
and O
enthusiasm N
survives O
them O
. O

I H
feel O
like O
if O
it O
were O
in O
my H
power N
in O
any O
way N
, O
that O
kid H
would O
have O
led O
his O
parents H
right O
through O
the O
damned O
thing N
. O

If O
I H
were O
the O
' O
operator H
' O
of O
that O
site N
, O
at O
the O
end N
I H
would O
have O
walked O
the O
family N
through O
every O
damn O
clue N
the O
kid H
noticed O
and O
made O
sure O
the O
parents H
knew O
the O
kid H
was O
right O
. O

They O
probably O
won't O
wo O
n't O
and O
he O
will O
develop O
chronic O
depression N
. O

Me H
irl O

That O
would O
seem O
to O
suggest O
parents H
aren't O
are O
n't O
all O
knowing O
geniuses H
. O

Say O
it O
a O
nit O
so O
! O
! O

I H
will O
not O
go O

Turn O
the O
lights N
off O

Carry O
me H
home O

NANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANA O

It O
amazes O
me H
the O
chunks N
of O
time N
it O
takes O
for O
people N
to O
respond O
to O
these O
things N
D:> O

1 O
year N
later O

Late O
night N
, O
come O
home O

Work N
sucks O
, O
I H
know O

She O
left O
me H
roses A
by O
the O
stairs N
. O

Not O
to O
over O
step O
my H
boundaries N
but O
... O
what O
cunts H
. O

That O
poor O
child H
deserves O
to O
be O
encouraged O
and O
listened O
to O
. O
:( O

This O
is O
the O
flaw N
with O
the O
premise N
of O
the O
movie N
Idiocracy O
. O

My H
parents H
always O
did O
that O
when O
I H
was O
a O
kid H
whenever O
there O
was O
a O
problem N
that O
needing O
thinking O
through O
they O
never O
let O
me H
help O
or O
dismissed O
every O
idea N
I H
had O
simply O
because O
I H
was O
understandably O
a O
kid H
but O
you H
still O
have O
to O
at O
least O
let O
your H
kids H
try O

help O

take O
their O
suggestions N
seriously O

Thats O
That O

the O
whole O
point N

OH O
WAIT O
I H
THOUGHT O

ANOTHER O

So O
we H
do O

whole O
package N

people N

Dude H
calls N
up O
to O
set O
up O
a O
proposal N
, O
I H
ask O
what O
room N
he O
wants O
etcetera O
. O

So O
then O
I H
tell O
him O
the O
total O
price N
to O
book N
out O
the O
entire O
room N
for O
the O
proposal N
. O

He O
says O
he O
just O
wants O
to O
buy O
the O
two O
tickets N
for O
him O
and O
his O
girlfriend H
, O
I H
tell O
him O
we H
can't O
ca O
n't O
have O
strangers H
playing O
a O
game N
that O
their O
experience N
is O
impacted O
/ O
altered O
by O
the O
fact N
that O
there's O
there O
's O
a O
proposal N
going O
on O
. O

Proposal N
happens O
in O
an O
Escape N
Room N
, O
there's O
there O
's O
no O
longer O
a O
game N
, O
it O
becomes O
about O
the O
proposal N
. O

I H
know O
this O
because O
I've O
I H
've O
seen O
it O
happen O
a O
hundred O
times N
. O

Anyway O
, O
dude H
refuses O
to O
buy O
out O
all O
of O
the O
tickets N
. O

Says O
he O
wants O
strangers H
to O
be O
there O
, O
he's O
he O
's O
not O
going O
to O
buy O
the O
other O
four O
tickets N
. O

I H
hand N
the O
phone N
to O
my H
manager O
, O
they O
hash O
out O
details N
together O
. O

Over O
the O
next O
three O
weeks N
leading O
up O
to O
the O
proposal N
, O
this O
guy H
calls N
every O

Single O

Fucking O

Day N

There's O
There O
's O
nothing O
else O
to O
figure N
out O
, O
we've O
we H
've O
got O
it O
all O
set O
up O
, O
but O
this O
guy H
is O
constantly O
badgering O
us H
. O

The O
big O
day N
rolls O
around O
, O
he O
arrives O
early O
so O
he O
can O
hide O
out O
, O
and O
this O
dude H
is O
a O
kid H
. O

Like O
, O
pimple N

voice N
- O
cracking O
, O
hair N

growing O

in O

weird O

places O
kind N
of O
kid H

Everybody O
in O
the O
control O
room N
is O
talking O
about O
him O
, O
because O
he's O
he O
's O
been O
a O
thorn N
in O
our H
collective O
sides N
for O
weeks N
, O
and O
we're O
we H
're O
speculating O
about O
telling O
him O
marriage N
at O
his O
age N
is O
a O
horrible O
idea N
, O
but O
whatever O
it's O
it O
's O
too O
late O
. O

So O
he O
hides O
, O
the O
girl H
and O
her O
friends H
show O
up O
, O
they O
get O
started O
and O
we H
stash O
the O
dude H
in O
the O
second O
hidden O
room N
that O
they'll O
they O
'll O
eventually O
end N
up O
in O
. O

Everybody O
crowds N
around O
the O
monitor O
to O
watch O
and O
this O
guy H
pulls O
out O
a O
bouquet N
of O
flowers N
and O
unfurls O
a O
sign O
that O
says O
" O
NAME N
REDACTED O
, O
will O
you H
go O
with O
me H
to O
PROM N

And O
the O

loses O
their O

Weeks N

constant O

endless O

the O

from O

the O
only O

to O

This O
is O
further O
underlined O
when O
dialogue N
from O
the O

to O

as O
the O
destination N

of O

are O
also O
apparently O
in O

. O

Also O
, O
it O
is O
interesting O
to O
note N
that O
Boo O
going O
through O
the O
door N
into O
the O
Monster A

was O
said O
to O
be O
" O
the O

" O
, O
and O
if O
there O
were O
other O

you H
would O
think O
this O

The O

with O
no O
indication N
that O

anyone O

at O
any O

Waternoose O
mentions O
that O
the O

has O
been O
in O
his O
family N
for O
" O
3 O

" O
( O
Alluding O
to O
a O
possible O
timeline N
for O

in O
the O
Monster A

, O
but O
that's O
that O
's O
a O
whole O
other O
theory N
) O
, O
and O
he O
seems O
unusually O
attached O
to O
it O

Most O
rich O
people N
would O
take O
advantage N
of O
other O
options N
and O
be O
unconcerned O
about O

company N

but O
something O
in O
the O
way N
he O
says O
it O
( O
especially O
since O
he O
is O
not O
the O
sole O
owner H
, O
given O
his O
concern N
about O
the O
Board O
of O
Directors O
) O
suggests O
that O
there O
simply O
are O
no O
other O
options N
for O
him O
. O

Why O
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
there O
be O
other O
options N
for O
him O
in O
a O
decent O
- O
sized O
world N
? O

Monstropolis O
is O
the O
only O
city N
ever O
mentioned O
. O

No O
indication N
that O
the O
supposedly O
- O
massive O
energy N
crisis N
is O
causing O
problems N
anywhere O
else O
, O
like O
in O
other O
, O
less O
- O
wealthy O
countries N

When O
trying O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
Boo O
, O
Mike H
makes O
several O
interesting O
statements N
: O

a. O
He O
refers O
to O
digging O
a O
tunnel N
under O
the O
city N

b. O
Using O
these O
to O
release N
Boo O
into O
" O
The O
Wild O
" O

c. O
And O
he O
has O
previously O
discarded O
ideas N
involving O
an O
enormous O
slingshot N
and O
a O
gigantic O
wooden O
horse A

Why O
would O
tunnels N
be O
necessary O
? O

Why O
all O
the O
planning O
in O
the O
first O
place N
? O

Why O
not O
just O
stuff N
Boo O
in O
the O
trunk N
of O
his O
car N
, O
drive O
her O
out O
of O
city N
limits N
, O
and O
set O
her O
loose O
? O

Because O
he O
can't O
ca O
n't O
. O

And O
what O
are O
all O
these O
things N
good O
at O
doing O
? O

Getting O
past N
walls N
. O

And O
walls N
, O
especially O
ones O
you H
can't O
ca O
n't O
get O
past N
, O
are O
usually O
there O
for O
a O
reason N
. O

But O
what O
reason N
? O

We've O
We H
've O
seen O
gigantic O
monsters A
in O
both O
movies N
, O
so O
the O
most O
likely O
reason N
seems O
to O
be O
that O
there O
are O
things N
out O
there O
that O
put O
even O
these O
kaiju O
to O
shame N
, O
or O
else O
they O
could O
simply O
march O
outside O
and O
kill O
whatever O
is O
threatening O
Monster A
civilization N
. O

But O
even O
this O
presents O
a O
problem N
, O
because O
then O
the O
Monsters A
could O
still O
periodically O
leave O
the O
city N
like O
Attack O
on O
Titan O
. O

Yet O
Mike's O
Mike H
's O
apparent O
refusal N
to O
consider O
going O
through O
any O
possible O
gates N
aside O
from O
an O
ridiculously O
overkill O
idea N
suggests O
that O
if O
any O
gates N
do O
exist O
, O
they O
are O
tightly O
sealed O
against O
all O
but O
the O
most O
extreme N
of O
circumstances N
. O

Why O
would O
they O
be O
sealed O
if O
the O
Monsters A
could O
leave O
? O

The O
simplest O
explanation N
for O
this O
is O
that O
the O
very O
environment N
is O
hostile O
to O
the O
Monsters A
. O

What O
kind N
of O
environment N
could O
" O
The O
Wild O
" O
be O
? O

A O
never O
- O
ending O
wasteland N
like O
the O
Glowing O
Sea O
? O

A O
land N
that O
has O
already O
mutated O
some O
lifeforms O
into O
Lovecraftian O
horrors N
that O
stalk O
the O
land N
looking O
for O
lesser O
life N
to O
consume O
? O

Could O
this O
land N
be O
related O
to O
some O
event N
that O
caused O
Monster A
civilization N
to O
reject O
other O
forms N
of O
energy N
in O
favor N
of O
relatively O
safe O
, O
non-volatile O
scream O
energy N
? O

What O
if O
the O
world N
surrounding O
Monstropolis O
is O
the O
human O
world N
? O

The O
only O
thing N
the O
monsters A
seem O
to O
be O
scared O
of O
is O
a O
human O
child H
, O
believing O
them O
to O
be O
toxic O
and O
deadly O
. O

Maybe O
they O
found O
a O
way N
to O
keep O
their O
city N
hidden O
from O
humans A
since O
they O
are O
scared O
of O
us H
and O
the O
door N
system N
isn't O
is O
n't O
actually O
taking O
them O
to O
another O
dimension N
but O
somewhere O
else O
on O
the O
same O
planet N
... O

That O
makes O
more O
sense N
, O
why O
would O
monsters A
be O
afraid O
of O
monsters A
? O

They O
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
... O
IF O
whatever O
was O
outside O
was O
like O
them O
. O

Which O
raises O
the O
question N
: O
what O
do O
monsters A
consider O
monsters A
? O

Humans A

It O
seems O
unlikely O
, O
since O
if O
that O
were O
the O
case N
, O
they O
could O
simply O
talk O
to O
the O
humans A
who O
could O
then O
work O
with O
them O
to O
provide O
any O
number N
of O
energy N
solutions N
that O
don't O
do O
n't O
involve O
screams N
. O

Plus O
, O
despite O
the O
tech N
we've O
we H
've O
seen O
monsters A
use O
, O
we've O
we H
've O
never O
seen O
them O
use O
any O
cloaking O
tech N
( O
something O
that O
would O
no O
doubt N
come O
in O
useful O
for O
scarers N
) O
for O
something O
even O
monster H
- O
sized O
, O
let O
alone O
something O
that O
could O
hide O
an O
entire O
city N

And O
don't O
do O
n't O
forget O
that O
they O
talk O
about O
the O
two O
worlds N
as O
if O
they O
actually O
ARE O
two O
different O
worlds N
. O

If O
they O
were O
on O
the O
same O
planet N
, O
it O
would O
make O
much O
more O
sense N
to O
talk O
about O
borders N
and O
being O
outside O
the O
boundaries N

of O
being O
willing O
to O
start N
a O
nuclear O
war N
and O
I H
sympathise O
with O
the O
Article N
. O

They O
are O
certainly O
being O
nasty O
to O
the O
United O
Nations N
Security N
Council N
in O
connection N
with O
the O
anti-proliferation O
treaty N
. O

The O
President H
has O
also O
said O
he O
would O
like O
to O
see O
Israel O
wiped O
off O
the O
map N
which O
he O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
even O
begin O
to O
try O
without O
nuclear O
weapons N
. O

But O
he O
has O
insisted O
that O
he O
wants O
nuclear O
power N
for O
peaceful O
purposes N
. O

Many O
people N
want O
to O
use O
diplomacy N
with O
Iran O
rather O
than O
military N
pressure N
. O

But O
will O
diplomacy N
work O
? O

And O
can O
anyone O
use O
military N
pressure N
without O
proof N
? O

One O
reader H
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
President H
watched O
the O
Americans H
in O
the O
embassy N
when O
they O
took O
them O
hostage H
. O

He O
has O
denied O
this O
. O

We H
don't O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
believe O
him O
. O

But O
we H
can't O
ca O
n't O
prove O
it O
. O

It O
does O
seem O
that O
Iranians O
frequently O
make O
statements N
and O
then O
hide O
behind O
lack N
of O
proof N
. O

Angry O
crowds N
chanted O
anti-American O
slogans N
in O
the O
western O
city N

Falluja O

Reuters O
reported O
that O
" O
Sunni O
clerics H
in O

Declaration N
by O
the O

condemning O
the O

" O
The O

Let O
aggressive O

that O
we H
are O
capable O

" O

The O
clerics H

talks O
with O

. O

Falluja O
has O
long O
been O
roiled O
by O
tense O
relations N
with O
the O
US O
soldiers H
there O
, O
since O
local O
Sunnis O
either O
remain O
committed O
to O
Arab O
nationalism N
or O
have O
become O
Sunni O
fundamentalists H
or O
even O

. O

Cities N
such O

a O
disproportionate O
share O
of O
the O
country's O
country N

They O
know O
that O
the O
American O
advent N

for O
them O
a O
demotion N

an O
elevation N

but O
out O
of O
the O
NY O

and O
Washington O
Post O
completely O
. O

I H
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
BBC O
for O
this O
report N
. O

It's O
It O
's O
symptomatic O
, O
I H
suppose O
, O
of O
our H
fast O
- O
paced O
, O
24 O
hour N
news N
- O
cycle N
lives N
, O
that O
the O
biggest O
short O
- O
term N
humanitarian O
crisis N
in O
the O
world N
would O
quickly O
be O
eclipsed O
, O
once O
our H
Secretary O
of O
State N
was O
finished O
with O
his O
whirlwind N
tour N
, O
from O
the O
newspapers N
. O

It's O
It O
's O
just O
disappointing O
. O

Most O
troubling O
, O
however O
, O
is O
the O
fact N
that O
the O
political O
will O
to O
end N
the O
crisis N
expressed O
a O
few O
short O
weeks N
ago O
seems O
to O
have O
ebbed O
. O

At O
that O
time N
, O
UN O
Secretary O
General O
Kofi O
Annan O
demanded O
steps N
be O
taken O
to O
end N
the O
ethnic O
violence N
in O
Darfur O
within O
48 O
hours N
. O

Two O
weeks N
later O
, O
and O
the O
violence N
continues O
. O

The O
African O
Union N
is O
clearly O
not O
up O
to O
the O
task N
of O
keeping O
the O
peace N
, O
pledging O
300 O
troops N
to O
an O
area N
that O
will O
need O
15,000 O
, O
according O
to O
analysts H
. O

And O
international O
donors H
have O
given O
only O
half O
of O
the O
relief N
aid N
that O
Darfur O
needs O
, O
according O
to O
the O
local O
UN O
officials H
. O

So O
hear O
we H
are O
, O
two O
weeks N
later O
, O
after O
that O
dazzling O
PR O
display O
two O
weeks N
ago O
by O
Powell H
and O
Annan O
, O
and O
the O
situation N
on O
the O
ground N
in O
Darfur O
appears O
basically O
unchanged O
. O

Warren H
Buffett O
is O
giving O
away O
85 O
% O
of O
his O
wealth N
, O
mostly O
to O
the O
Bill O
and O
Melinda O
Gates O
Foundation O
. O

It's O
It O
's O
a O
move O
that O
really O
worries O
me H
; O
Buffett's O
Buffett O
's O
usual O
justification N
for O
keeping O
most O
of O
his O
money N
was O
that O
he O
was O
still O
compounding O
the O
value N
of O
his O
fortune N
at O
a O
pretty O
high O
rate N
, O
so O
any O
gifts N
now O
would O
mean O
significantly O
less O
money N
for O
the O
foundation N
later O
. O

It's O
It O
's O
a O
little O
hard O
to O
parse O
, O
but O
at O
this O
point N
his O
ostensible O
view N
is O
that O
the O
Gateses O
are O
very O
good O
money N
- O
redistributors O
, O
and O
he O
wants O
them O
to O
have O
the O
money N
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O

Which O
essentially O
sounds N
like O
he's O
he O
's O
worried O
that O
Bill H
or O
Melinda H
are O
going O
to O
die O
soon O
. O

I H
assume O
his O
actual O
reason N
is O
that O
he's O
he O
's O
worried O
that O
Berkshire O
Hathaway O
just O
can't O
ca O
n't O
grow O
quickly O
enough O
to O
justify O
his O
usual O
charity N
policy N
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
sure O
how O
the O
market N
will O
react O
. O

It O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
change O
the O
company's O
company N
's O
intrinsic O
worth O
, O
and O
as O
the O
article N
notes N
, O
the O
company N
might O
be O
added O
to O
a O
major O
index N
once O
the O
shares N
get O
more O
liquid O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand N
, O
this O
is O
essentially O
a O
statement N
that O
the O
company N
is O
overpriced O
from O
the O
guy H
who O
knows O
it O
best O
-- O
and O
happens O
to O
be O
the O
best O
investor H
of O
the O
last O
century N
. O

em O
... O
no O
... O
the O
Gates H
foundation N
mainly O
invests O
in O
medical O
research N
and O
education N
, O
that O
means O
donating O
now O
adds O
a O
tremendous O
value N
compared O
to O
donating O
in O
ten O
years N
. O

Because O
the O
10.000.000 O
people N
dying O
from O
malaria N
will O
otherwise O
be O
dead O
. O

i.e O
. O

He's O
He O
's O
not O
giving O
85 O
% O
away O
, O
he's O
he O
's O
giving O
a O
number N
of O
shares N
each O
year N
that O
decrease O
in O
number N
at O
the O
rate N
of O
5 O
% O
a O
year N
( O
until O
gone O
? O
) O
. O

He O
mentions O
his O
wife's O
wife H
's O
death N
having O
an O
effect N
on O
him O
. O

It O
sounds N
pretty O
rational O
that O
he's O
he O
's O
saying O
that O
Bill H
and O
Melinda H
are O
at O
a O
prime O
spot N
, O
so O
starting O
the O
money N
hose O
now O
is O
a O
good O
idea N
, O
but O
Buffet O
is O
still O
keeping O
most O
of O
his O
donation N
inside O
of O
Berkshire O
where O
it O
will O
compound N
. O

Bill H
over O
at O
The O
Fourth O
Rail O
has O
an O
excellent O
essay N
on O
how O
the O
MSM O
and O
the O
UN O
, O
even O
the O
leftist O
countries N
in O
Europe O
, O
are O
basically O
accepting O
terrorist O
organizations N
as O
legitimate O
forms N
of O
a O
political O
party N
: O

On O
the O
same O
day N
Palestinians O
protest O
in O
support O
of O
Hezbollah O
and O
Syria O
, O
the O
terrorist O
group N
Hamas O
has O
indicated O
it O
will O
participate O
in O
the O
scheduled O
upcoming O
Parliamentary O
elections N
. O

To O
the O
north N
in O
Lebanon O
, O
there O
is O
serious O
debate N
within O
Hezbollah O
about O
entering O
the O
Lebanese O
political O
process N
in O
light O
of O
Syria's O
Syria O
's O
promised O
withdrawal N
. O

Syria O
has O
agreed O
to O
withdraw O
under O
the O
conditions N
set O
forth O
in O
UNSC O
Resolution O
1559 O
, O
which O
has O
already O
begun O
. O

UN O
Secretary O
- O
General O
Kofi O
Annan O
has O
indicated O
it O
is O
time N
to O
" O
recognize O
Hezbollah O
" O
after O
easily O
being O
duped O
by O
" O
the O
message N
on O
the O
placards N
they O
are O
using O
" O
. O

This O
acceptance N
of O
blatantly O
terrorist O
groups N
as O
legitimate O
freedom N
movements N
is O
a O
cancerous O
tumor N
on O
the O
United O
Nations N
and O
the O
media N
. O

Over O
three O
years N
after O
9-11 O
, O
the O
United O
Nations N
, O
despite O
their O
attempts N
to O
project N
strength N
in O
fighting O
terrorism N
, O
still O
cannot O
can O
not O
properly O
define O
the O
word N
" O
terrorist O
" O
, O
waffling O
over O
the O
issue N
of O
whether O
the O
murder N
of O
innocent O
civilians H
are O
terrorist O
acts N
. O

The O
media N
routinely O
obscures O
the O
lines N
between O
terrorism N
and O
legitimate O
resistance N
, O
as O
the O
recent O
article N
by O
Daniel H
Okrent O
of O
The O
New O
York O
Times O
demonstrates O
. O

... O

The O
decision N
to O
sidestep O
the O
obvious O
to O
satisfy O
the O
need O
to O
avoid O
confrontation N
does O
not O
bring O
peace N
, O
but O
only O
delays O
the O
eventual O
conflict N
as O
the O
predators H
of O
Hamas O
and O
Hezbollah O
exploit O
the O
inherent O
weakness N
of O
the O
internationals N
and O
the O
media N
. O

I've O
I H
've O
been O
fuming O
over O
this O
fact N
for O
a O
few O
weeks N
now O
, O
ever O
since O
some O
organizations N
and O
governments N
suggested O
we H
need O
to O
accept O
the O
fact N
that O
Hezbollah O
will O
get O
involved O
in O
running O
Lebanon O
. O

Wtf O
is O
this O
? O

This O
is O
a O
terrorist O
organization N
plain O
and O
simple O
. O

This O
is O
the O
organization N
that O
bombed O
our H
Marine O
barracks N
in O
1983 O
, O
took O
Americans H
hostage H
throughout O
the O
80's N
and O
now O
they O
should O
be O
considered O
a O
legitimate O
organization N
? O

This O
is O
just O
another O
reason N
to O
never O
trust N
the O
MSM O
, O
and O
certainly O
not O
the O
Europeans H
. O

The O
Iraqi O
Islamic O
Party O
lead N
by O
Muhsin O
Abdul H
Hamid O
, O
has O
been O
among O
the O
few O
Sunni O
Muslim O
groups N
willing O
to O
cooperate O
( O
even O
if O
rather O
lukewarmly O
) O
with O
the O
Americans H
. O

It O
is O
now O
threatening O
to O
pull O
out O
of O
the O
Allawi O
caretaker H
government N
. O

The O
IIP O
had O
also O
been O
the O
main O
force N
urging O
Sunni O
Arabs H
to O
participate O
in O
the O
elections N
scheduled O
for O
January O
, O
and O
had O
been O
opposed O
in O
this O
stance N
by O
the O
Association O
of O
Muslim O
Scholars O
. O

That O
the O
Iraqi O
Islamic O
Party O
is O
now O
contemplating O
leaving O
the O
Allawi O
government N
raises O
the O
question N
of O
whether O
a O
mass N
Sunni O
Arab O
boycott N
of O
the O
elections N
is O
in O
the O
offing N
, O
thus O
fatally O
weakening O
the O
legitimacy N
of O
any O
new O
government N
. O

Az O
- O
Zaman O
: O
The O
Association O
of O
Muslim O
Scholars O
forbade O
Iraqis O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
attack N
on O
Fallujah O
with O
the O
Americans H
. O

In O
a O
communique N
, O
the O
AMS O
said O
that O
for O
Iraqis O
to O
take O
part N
with O
" O
raiding O
forces N
" O
in O
the O
assault N
on O
a O
city N
, O
the O
population N
of O
which O
is O
Muslim O
( O
such O
as O
Fallujah O
) O
would O
be O
considered O
the O
most O
mortal O
of O
mortal O
sins N
. O

The O
Sunni O
AMS O
told O
Iraqis O
, O
" O
You H
sinned O
when O
you H
participated O
with O
occupation N
forces N
in O
the O
assault N
on O
Najaf O
, O
and O
beware O
lest O
you H
repeat O
this O
same O
sin N
in O
Fallujah O
. O

Remember O
that O
the O
Occupation N
is O
emphemeral O
. O
" O

The O
radical O
Shiite O
Sadr O
movement N
issued O
a O
statement N
forbidding O
the O
participation N
of O
Iraqi O
troops N
in O
the O
attack N
on O
Fallujah O
, O
as O
well O
. O

The O
statement N
said O
, O
" O
We H
direct O
an O
appeal N

called O

ploy N

the O
assertaion O
that O
the O

The O

more O
militant O
Sunni O
Muslim O
clerics H
of O
AMS O
and O
the O
radical O
Shiites O

President H
Bush H
pinched O
a O
few O
nerves N
yesterday N
with O
his O
choice N
of O
words N
: O

WASHINGTON O
( O
Reuters O
) O
- O

U.S. O
Muslim O
groups N
criticized O
President H
Bush H
on O
Thursday O
for O
calling O
a O
foiled O
plot O
to O
blow O
up O
airplanes N
part N
of O
a O
" O
war N
with O
Islamic O
fascists H
, O
" O
saying O
the O
term N
could O
inflame O
anti-Muslim O
tensions N
. O

U.S. O
officials H
have O
said O
the O
plot O
, O
thwarted O
by O
Britain O
, O
to O
blow O
up O
several O
aircraft N
over O
the O
Atlantic O
bore O
many O
of O
the O
hallmarks N
of O
al O

. O

" O
We H
believe O
this O
is O
an O
ill O
- O
advised O
term N
and O
we H
believe O
that O
it O
is O
counterproductive O
to O
associate O
Islam O

Muslims O
with O
fascism N

he O

say O
we're O

We're O
We H

By O
using O
the O

Bush H

purposely O
not O

We've O

a O

one O
word N
that O

if O
it's O
it O
's O
Islamic O

and O

, O
it's O
it O
's O
an O
Islamic O
fascist H
. O

But O
because O
we H
don't O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
sound O
hateful O
we H
must O
pretend O
everyone's O
everyone O
's O
a O
possible O
suspect H
and O
make O
airline N
travel O
more O
miserable O
than O
it's O
it O
's O
ever O
been O
. O

On O
the O
internet N
site N
of O
Monotheism O
and O
Holy O
War N
( O
al O
- O
Tawhid O
wa O
al O
- O
Jihad O
) O
, O
the O
group N
allegedly O
declared O
, O
" O
We H
announce O
that O
the O
Tawhid O
and O
Jihad O
Group O
, O
its O
prince H
and O
soldiers H
, O
have O
pledged O
allegiance N
to O
the O
sheikh H
of O
the O
mujahideen N
Osama O
bin O
Laden O
. O
" O

This O
pledge N
is O
a O
new O
development N
. O

Abu H
Musab O
al O
- O
Zarqawi O
and O
his O
group N
are O
said O
to O
have O
been O
bitter O
rivals H
of O
al O
- O
Qaeda O
during O
the O
Afghan O
resistance N
days N
. O

One O
witness H
at O
the O
Moutasaddiq O
trial N
in O
Germany O
alleged O
that O
Zarqawi O
had O
not O
allowed O
Monotheism O
and O
Holy O
War N
to O
share O
resources N
with O
al O
- O
Qaeda O
in O
the O
early O
zeroes N
of O
the O
21st O
century N
. O

If O
the O
statement N
is O
true O
, O
it O
is O
a O
worrying O
sign O
that O
even O
the O
divided O
small O
radical O
guerrilla H
groups N
are O
being O
" O
picked O
up O
" O
by O
al O
- O
Qaeda O
. O

This O
consolidation N
is O
obviously O
a O
result N
of O
Bush's O
Bush H
's O
aggressive O
invasion N
of O
Iraq O
and O
of O
the O
botching O
of O
the O
aftermath N
. O

It O
is O
a O
setback N
for O
the O
war N
on O
terror N
. O

Al O
- O
Qaeda O
in O
Afghanistan O
was O
a O
group N
of O
only O
a O
few O
hundred O
" O
Afghan O
Arabs H
" O
who O
pledged O
personal O
loyalty N
to O
Usamah O
Bin H
Laden O
. O

It O
could O
notionally O
be O
expanded O
to O
encompass O
the O
5,000 O
- O
strong O
" O
55th O
Brigade O
" O
of O
the O
Taliban O
regime N
, O
though O
this O
is O
not O
the O
technical O
definition N
. O

Because O
Usamah O
is O
Saudi O
, O
my H
guess O
is O
that O
they O
were O
especially O
influenced O
by O
an O
extremist H
form N
of O
the O
Wahhabi O
school N
of O
Islam H
that O
predominates O
among O
Saudia's O
Saudia O
's O
some O
15 O
million O
citizens H
. O

In O
1998 O
they O
were O
joined O
by O
Egyptians O
from O
the O
al O
- O
Jihad O
al O
- O
Islami O
group N
of O
Ayman O
al O
- O
Zawahiri O
( O
many O
of O
these O
were O
from O
Upper O
Egypt O
, O
especially O
Asyut O
and O
environs N
) O
. O

After O
that O
point N
, O
al O
- O
Qaeda O
was O
a O
joint O
enterprise N
between O
the O
Egyptian O
extremists H
and O
the O
polyglot H
Arabs H
around O
Bin H
Laden O
, O
only O
some O
of O
whom O
were O
Saudi O
. O

Zarqawi O
is O
a O
Jordanian O
, O
and O
his O
Monotheism O
and O
Holy O
War N
group N
in O
Afghanistan O
probably O
had O
a O
distinctive O
coloration N
as O
mainly O
Jordanian O
, O
Palestinian O
and O
Syrian O
. O

They O
also O
had O
a O
special O
connection N
to O
some O
extremists H
in O
Jordan O
and O
Germany O
. O

They O
are O
probably O
especially O
oriented O
toward O
the O
Salafi O
school N
of O
modern O
Islamic O
thought O
, O
which O
has O
a O
Protestant O
- O
like O
emphasis N
on O
going O
back N
to O
the O
original O
practice N
of O
the O
early O
companions H
of O
the O
Prophet H
Muhammad H
. O

( O
Most O
Salafis O
are O
not O
militant O
or O
violent O
, O
though O
they O
tend O
to O
be O
rather O
narrow O
- O
minded O
in O
my H
experience N
, O
on O
the O
order N
of O
Protestant O
Pietists O
) O
. O

Monotheism O
and O
Holy O
War N
obviously O
does O
have O
a O
violent O
interpretation N
of O
Salafism O
, O
rather O
as O
the O
the O
leaders H
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
German O
Peasant O
Rebellion O
among O
early O
Protestants O
did O
. O

Another O
worrisome O
sign O
is O
that O
local O
Iraqi O
Sunni O
fundamentalists H
opposed O
to O
the O
US O
presence N
in O
Iraq O
have O
begun O
joining O
Monotheism O
and O
Holy O
War N
, O
and O
wearing O
its O
distinctive O
orange N
and O
black O
insignia N
. O

These O
have O
been O
sighted O
among O
Iraqi O
crowds N
on O
Haifa O
Street N
in O
Baghdad O
and O
in O
Samarra O
. O

So O
now O
there O
are O
hundreds N
of O
al O
- O
Qaeda O
members N
in O
Iraq O
where O
there O
had O
been O
none O
before O
. O

The O
consolidation N
of O
smaller O
local O
radical O
fundamentalist O
groups N
with O
al O
- O
Qaeda O
can O
also O
be O
seen O
in O
the O
case N
of O
the O
Fizazi O
group N
in O
Tangiers N
that O
morphed O
into O
the O
Moroccan O
Islamic O
Combatant O
Group O
, O
had O
members N
who O
met O
with O
September O
11 O
ringleader H
Muhammad H
Atta O
, O
and O
ultimately O
was O
in O
part N
responsible O
for O
the O
Madrid O
train N
bombings N
. O

The O
September O
11 O
Panel O
will O
issue N
its O
findings N
on O
Thursday O
. O

It O
notes N
10 O
points N
at O
which O
the O
US O
made O
key N
mistakes N
that O
might O
have O
stopped O
Bin H
Laden's O
Laden O
's O
plot O
. O

Four O
of O
these O
were O
under O
Clinton H
and O
6 O
under O
Bush H
. O

Bush H
came O
out O
today N
and O
said O
that O
if O
he O
had O
known O
what O
was O
coming O
, O
he O
would O
have O
expended O
every O
effort N
to O
stop O
it O
, O
and O
that O
so O
would O
have O
Clinton H
. O

This O
statement N
is O
, O
despite O
its O
facade N
of O
fair O
- O
mindedness O
, O
so O
many O
weasel H
words N
. O

Of O
course O
Bush H
would O
have O
tried O
to O
stop O
9/11 O
if O
he O
had O
known O
it O
was O
coming O
. O

The O
question N
is O
, O
" O
Should O
he O
have O
known O
it O
was O
coming O
? O
" O

The O
answer N
is O
, O
" O
Yes O
! O
" O

We H
now O
know O
that O
Bush H
and O
his O
administration N
came O
into O
office N
obsessed O
with O
Iraq O
. O

Cheney H
was O
looking O
at O
maps N
of O
Iraq O
oil N
fields N
and O
muttering O
about O
opportunities N
for O
US O
companies N
there O
, O
already O
in O
January O
or O
February O
of O
2001 O
. O

Wolfowitz O
contradicted O
counter-terrorism O
czar H
Richard H
Clarke H
when O
the O
latter O
spoke O
of O
the O
al O
- O
Qaeda O
threat N
, O
insisting O
that O
the O
preeminent O
threat N
of O
terrorism N
against O
the O
US O
came O
from O
Iraq O
, O
and O
indicating O
he O
accepted O
Laurie H
Mylroie's O
Mylroie O
's O
crackpot H
conspiracy N
theory N
that O
Saddam H
was O
behind O
the O
1993 O
World O
Trade O
Towers O
bombing N
. O

If O
you H
believe O
crackpot H
theories N
instead O
of O
focusing O
on O
the O
reality N
-- O
that O
was O
an O
al O
- O
Qaeda O
operation N
mainly O
carried O
out O
by O
al O
- O
Gamaa O
al O
- O
Islamiyyah O
, O
an O
Egyptian O
terrorist O
component N
allied O
with O
Bin H
Laden O
-- O
then O
you H
will O
concentrate O
on O
the O
wrong O
threat N
. O

Even O
after O
the O
attacks N
on O
September O
11 O
, O
Bush H
was O
obsessing O
about O
Iraq O
. O

Wolfowitz O
lied O
to O
him O
and O
said O
that O
there O
was O
a O
10 O
to O
50 O
% O
chance N
that O
Iraq O
was O
behind O
them O
. O

( O
On O
what O
evidence N
? O

The O
hijackers H
were O
obviously O
al O
- O
Qaeda O
, O
and O
no O
operational O
links N
between O
al O
- O
Qaeda O
and O
Iraq O
had O
ever O
been O
found O
) O
. O

Rumsfeld O
initially O
rejected O
an O
attack N
on O
al O
- O
Qaeda O
bases N
in O
Afghanistan O
, O
saying O
there O
were O
" O
no O
good O
targets N
" O
in O
Afghanistan O
. O

( O
What O
about O
40 O
al O
- O
Qaeda O
bases N
that O
had O
trained O
the O
9/11 O
hijackers H
and O
other O
terrorists H
gunning O
for O
the O
United O
States O
?? O
) O

The O
Pentagon O
did O
not O
even O
have O
a O
plan N
for O
dealing O
with O
Afghanistan O
or O
al O
- O
Qaeda O
that O
it O
could O
pull O
off O
the O
shelf N
, O
according O
to O
Bob H
Woodward H
. O

Bush H
did O
not O
have O
his O
eye N
on O
the O
ball N
. O

Neither O
did O
Cheney H
, O
Rumsfeld O
, O
or O
Wolfowitz O
. O

They O
were O
playing O
Captain O
Ahab O
to O
Saddam's O
Saddam H
's O
great O
white O
whale H
. O

Imperial O
Hubris N
makes O
the O
case N
that O
lots N
of O
people N
in O
the O
CIA O
and O
counter-terrorism O
divisions N
elsewhere O
in O
the O
US O
government N
knew O
all O
about O
Bin H
Laden O
and O
the O
threat N
he O
posed O
. O

They O
were O
from O
all O
accounts N
marginalized O
and O
not O
listened O
to O
. O

Bush H
demoted O
Dick H
Clarke H
, O
among O
the O
most O
vocal O
and O
focused O
of O
the O
al O
- O
Qaeda O
experts H
, O
from O
his O
cabinet N
. O

Dick H
could O
never O
thereafter O
get O
any O
real O
cooperation N
from O
the O
cabinet N
officers H
, O
who O
outranked O
him O
, O
and O
he O
could O
not O
convince O
them O
to O
go O
to O
battle N
stations N
in O
the O
summer N
of O
2001 O
when O
George H
Tenet's O
Tenet O
's O
hair N
was O
" O
on O
fire N
" O
about O
the O
excited O
chatter N
the O
CIA O
was O
picking O
up O
from O
radical O
Islamist O
terrorists H
. O

As O
for O
the O
Clinton H
administration N
, O
let O
me H
say O
one O
thing N
in O
its O
defense N
. O

Clinton H
had O
worked O
out O
a O
deal N
with O
Pakistani O
Prime O
Minister O
Nawaz O
Sharif H
in O
summer N
of O
1999 O
that O
would O
have O
allowed O
the O
US O
to O
send O
a O
Special O
Ops O
team N
in O
after O
Bin H
Laden O
in O
Qandahar O
, O
based O
from O
Pakistan O
. O

I H
presume O
you H
need O
the O
Pakistan O
base N
for O
rescue O
operations N
in O
case N
anything O
went O
wrong O
. O

You H
also O
need O
Pakistani O
air N
space N
. O

The O
plan N
was O
all O
set O
and O
could O
have O
succeeded O
. O

But O
in O
fall O
of O
1999 O
, O
Gen. O
Pervez O
Musharraf O
made O
a O
coup N
against O
Nawaz O
Sharif H
. O

The O
Pakistani O
army N
was O
rife O
with O
elements N
protective O
of O
the O
Taliban O
, O
and O
the O
new O
military N
government N
reneged O
on O
the O
deal N
. O

Musharraf O
told O
Clinton H
he O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
use O
Pakistani O
soil N
or O
air N
space N
to O
send O
the O
team N
in O
against O
Bin H
Laden O
. O

Look O
at O
a O
map N
and O
you H
try O
to O
figure N
out O
how O
, O
in O
fall O
of O
1999 O
, O
you H
could O
possibly O
pull O
off O
such O
an O
operation N
without O
Pakistani O
facilities N
. O

Of O
course O
, O
you H
could O
just O
go O
in O
by O
main O
force N
. O

But O
for O
those O
of O
you H
tempted O
in O
that O
direction N
, O
please O
look O
up O
Carter's O
Carter H
's O
Tabas O
operation N
. O

It O
should O
be O
easily O
googled O
. O

Clinton H
tried O
, O
and O
tried O
hard O
. O

The O
gods A
weren't O
were O
n't O
with O
us H
on O
that O
one O
. O

is O
how O

exciting O
. O

that O
is O
like O

Hello O
from O
South O
America O
. O

I H
just O
got O
your H
email O
and O
I H
certainly O
concur O
with O
Jeff H
making O
the O
call N
. O

He O
has O
maintained O
a O
good O
relationship N
with O
Mulva O
. O

This O
was O
a O
risk N
that O
we H
had O
but O
we H
did O
have O
assurances N
from O
Phillips H
regarding O
performance N
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
much O
it O
will O
help O
however O
. O

Richard H
Harper H

may O
have O
some O
ideas N
here O
but O
I H
am O
sure O
you've O
you H
've O
already O
gone O
through O
it O
with O
them O
. O

I H
am O
amazed O
how O
the O
details N
get O
fuzzy O
on O
an O
old O
project N
. O

When O
you H
discussed O
it O
, O
i H
was O
trying O
to O
think O
back N
to O
our H
remedies N
and O
discussions N
but O
the O
3 O
years N
have O
made O
it O
difficult O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
there O
is O
anything O
I H
can O
do O
but O
I'm O
I H
'm O
always O
willing O
to O
help O
. O

Good O

Have O
you H
seen O
the O

the O

that O
he O
launched O
today N
? O

I H
think O
this O
is O
actually O
a O
good O
thing N
-- O
makes O
our H
proposal N
look O
like O
a O
much O
more O
preferable O
alternative O
by O
comparison N
, O
makes O
our H
support O
in O

I H

that O

too O
. O

I'll O
I H
'll O
search N

after O

if O
I H

Vince H

We H
are O
still O
trying O
to O
work O
the O
PSE O

transaction N
, O
now O
that O
the O
forex O
desk N
has O
been O
able O
to O
find O
a O
fix O
for O
CPI N
in O
the O
market N
. O

Further O
to O
my H
voicemail N
, O
our H
colleagues H
in O
credit N
are O
calculating O
the O
reserve N
on O
the O
PSE O
swap N
. O

They O
are O
currently O
using O
9.5 O
% O
fixed O
based O
on O
the O
1 O
year N
implied O
volatility N
. O

Volatility N
of O
USD O
/ O
DM N
has O
been O
in O
the O
range N
of O
between O
7 O
% O
and O
11 O
% O
. O

Can O
one O
of O
your H
research N
staff N
justify O
a O
suitable O
20 O
year N
volalatility O
number N
for O
USD O
/ O
Euro N
. O

Ideally O
, O
we H
would O
like O
a O
fast O
turnaround N
. O

In O
addition N
, O
is O
there O
someone O
who O
could O
consider O
the O
correlation N
between O
US O
CPI N
and O
the O
$ O
/ O
euro N
exchange N
rate N
. O

The O
credit N
guys H
are O
currently O
assuming O
that O
there O
is O
no O
correlation N
and O
may O
consequently O
be O
double O
dipping O
the O
credit N

on O
this O

Grateful O
for O

I H
was O
wondering O
if O
it O
would O
be O
OK O
for O

sit O

you H
one O

get O
a O
general O
feel O
of O
your H
end N
of O
the O
process N

Pat H

told O

before O

it O
would O
help O

I H

the O

now O
may O

be O
the O

time N

be O
in O

But O
let O
me H
know O
if O
I H
can O
spend O
a O

even O
just O
an O

with O
you H

it O

The O
Dow O
topped O
out O
in O
February O
of O
1966 O
at O
995 O
. O

By O
September O
of O
that O
year N
the O
Dow O
had O
tumbled O
to O
744 O
. O

The O
Dow O
then O
rallied O
to O
a O
high O
of O
943 O
in O
September O
of O
'67 O
. O

By O
March O
of O
'68 O
the O
Dow O
had O
fallen O
to O
825 O
, O
only O
to O
climb O
to O
a O
highly O
speculative O
peak N
of O
985 O
in O
December O
of O
'68 O
. O

The O
Dow O
then O
sank O
to O
631 O
in O
December O
of O
'70 O
. O

By O
April O
of O
'71 O
the O
Dow O
had O
climbed O
back N
to O
950 O
, O
only O
to O
fall O
to O
869 O
in O
February O
of O
'72 O
. O

A O
big O
rally O
then O
took O
the O
Dow O
( O
unconfirmed O
) O
to O
a O
record O
high O
of O
1051 O
in O
January O
of O
'73 O
, O
turning O
everyone O
bullish O
. O

But O
by O
December O
of O
'73 O
the O
Dow O
had O
collapsed O
to O
788 O
. O

Think O
that O
was O
bad O
- O
by O
December O
of O
'74 O
the O
Dow O
had O
sunk O
to O
a O
bear O
market N
low O
of O
577 O
. O

At O
that O
time N
, O
the O
gurus H
and O
geniuses H
of O
Wall O
Street N
were O
predicting O
a O
250 O
Dow O
and O
many O
were O
talking O
openly O
about O
the O
end N
of O
capitalism N
. O

Of O
course O
, O
that O
was O
the O
bottom N

And O
that's O
that O
's O
the O
way N
the O
greatest O
bear O
market N
since O
the O
Depression N
worked O
its O
way N
down O
. O

By O

Enron's O
Enron O

reflect O
the O

In O

there O
is O

a O

issues N

concern N

I'm O
I H

I H
think O
it O
could O
be O
useful O
to O
people N
campaigning O
about O
hospital N

We've O
We H

a O

and O
a O
group N
called O
NHS O
SOS O
have O
already O
put O
up O
a O
campaign N
about O
ward N
closures N
in O
Cumbria O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
hoping O
to O
build O
this O
up O
to O
be O
a O
hub N
for O
all O
the O
campaigners H
- O
a O
place N
where O

can O
exchange N

It O
would O
be O
great O
if O
the O
person H
from O
CHANT O
who O
started O

would O
put O
up O
a O

description N
of O
the O
campaign N
and O
a O
list N
to O
this O
group N
page N
on O
the O
Action O
Network O

Action O
Network O
is O
also O
a O
good O
place N
to O
post O

of O

try O
to O
rally O
together O
a O
group N
if O
you H
want O

You H
can O
attach O
anything O
you H

pages N
for O
your H
local O
area N

as O
well O
as O
to O
the O

I'm O

asks O

if O
anyone O
can O
give O
him O
an O
example N

a O
" O

One O

" O
No O

" O
Winston H
says O
, O
" O
That O
would O
be O
an O
ACCIDENT N

" O

A O
girl H
raises O
her O
hand N
. O

" O
If O
a O
school N
bus N
carrying O
fifty O
children H
drove O
off O
a O
cliff N
, O
killing O
everyone O
involved O
... O
that O
would O
be O
a O
tragedy N
" O
. O

" O
I'm O
I H
'm O
afraid O
not O
, O
" O
explains O
Winston H
, O
" O
that O
is O
what O
we H
would O
call N
a O
GREAT O
LOSS N

" O

The O
room N

silent O

none O

" O
What O
? O
" O
asks O

" O
isn't O

there O
any O
one O
here O
who O
can O
give O
me H
an O
example N

a O

" O

Finally O
, O
a O
boy H
in O
the O
back N
raises O
his O
hand N
. O

In O
a O
timid O
voice N
, O
he O
says O
: O
" O
If O
an O
airplane N
carrying O
Winston H
Peters H
was O
blown O
up O
by O
a O
bomb N

THAT O

Winston H

" O
Marvelous O

And O
can O
you H
tell O
me H
WHY O
that O
would O
be O
a O
tragedy N
? O
" O

" O
Well O
, O
" O
says O
the O
boy H
, O
" O
because O
it O
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
be O

it O

U.S. O
astronauts H
will O
launch O
to O
the O
moon N
on O
sleek O
, O
single O
, O
shuttle N
booster N
rockets N
and O
the O
first O
new O
upper O
- O
stage N
rocket N
this O
country N
has O
developed O
in O
more O
than O
a O
decade N
, O
NASA O
and O
the O
Pentagon O
have O
told O
the O
White O
House N
. O

Lunar O
landers N
and O
other O
gear N
needed O
for O
extended O
visits N
to O
the O
moon N
will O
be O
lofted O
by O
gargantuan O
launchers N
as O
big O
as O
the O
Apollo O
- O
era N
Saturn O
5 O
, O
the O
most O
powerful O
rockets N
ever O
flown O
. O

It O
looks O
as O
if O
NASA O
is O
transitioning O
away O
from O
the O
shuttle N
model N
, O
as O
in O
the O
past N
they O
have O
proven O
to O
be O
quite O
dangerous O
as O
Columbia O
has O
recently O
proved O
. O

Although O
these O
new O
rockets N
are O
probably O
more O
expensive O
, O
they O
will O
be O
able O
to O
go O
at O
a O
much O
greater O
range N
than O
it's O
shuttle N
cousins H
, O
as O
they O
can O
not O
only O
break O
free O
from O
the O
atmosphere N
but O
reach N
the O
moon N
as O
well O
. O

" O
NASA O
will O
initiate O
development N
of O
a O
Crew N
Launch N
Vehicle N
derived O
from O
space N
shuttle N
solid O
rocket N
boosters H
with O
a O
new O
upper O
stage N
for O
human O
spaceflight N
, O
" O
said O
the O
letter N
, O
signed O
by O
NASA O
Administrator H
Mike H
Griffin H
and O
the O
Pentagon's O
Pentagon O
's O
top N
space N
official O
, O
ex-astronaut O
Ron H
Sega H
... O

" O
NASA O
then O
plans O
to O
develop O
a O
new O
100 O
- O
metric O
- O
ton N
- O
class N
launch O
vehicle N
derived O
from O
existing O
capabilities N
with O
the O
space N
shuttle N
external O
tanks N
and O
solid O
rocket N
boosters H
for O
future N
missions N
to O
the O
moon N
, O
" O
the O
letter N
said O
. O

NASA O
is O
planning O
on O
using O
these O
new O
shuttles N
to O
replace O
the O
current O
models N
, O
with O
industry N
forecasters H
predicting O
a O
launch O
as O
early O
as O
2014 O
. O

The O
new O
rocket N
design O
will O
differ O
slightly O
from O
it's O
predecessors N
, O
in O
the O
fact N
that O
the O
crew N
and O
cargo N
would O
launch O
separately O
from O
two O
different O
rockets N
each O
and O
join O
up O
in O
space N
later O
on O
. O

Launching O
this O
way N
will O
hopefully O
avoid O
future N
disasters N
, O
giving O
more O
support O
towards O
NASA O
revisiting O
the O
stars N
. O

The O
thing N
about O

plz O
bring O
your H

it O
had O
only O
happened O

could O
get O
him O

away O

it O
could O
have O
been O
you H
missed O
his O
meal N
time N
and O
he O
needed O
to O
eat O
- O
since O
it O
sounds N
like O
it O
has O
happened O
several O
times N
over O
two O
days N
- O
then O
he O
may O
have O
gotten O
int O
to O
something O
that O

RIGHT O
AWAY O
!!! O

why O
are O
there O
two O
statues N
of O
David H
? O

i H
doing O
a O
research N
paper N
on O
donatello O
and O
i H
notice N
that O
there O
are O
two O
statues N
of O
David H
, O
a O
bronze N
one O
and O
marble N
one O
. O

Michelangelo O
made O
the O
marble N
one O
but O
why O
did O
he O
do O
another O
if O
Donatello O
had O
already O
made O
one O
? O

so O
im O
i H
m N
a O
little O
confused O
, O
why O
is O
there O
two O
statues N
of O
David H
? O

different O
generations N
, O
the O
donatello O
is O
of O
a O
boy H
david O
as O
a O
young O
sheep A
Herder H
, O
the O
Michelangelo O
is O
the O
grown O
up O
man H
david O
as O
slayer H
and O
king H

Because O
he O
liked O
making O
statues N
of O
David H
! O
:D O

Obviously O
, O
he O
should O
have O
been O
arrested O
and O
jailed O
- O
imagine O
making O
a O
statue N
or O
painting O
on O
the O
same O
subject N
as O
another O
artist H
- O
clearly O
insulting O
and O
disrespecting O
- O
wasted O
time N
that O
could O
have O
been O
used O
making O
a O
statue N
with O
clothes N
on O

Name N
of O
specific O
Hibachi O
restaurant N

Chicago O
? O

I H
have O
a O
friend H
out O
in O
Chicago O
this O
week N
, O
and O
I H
am O
trying O
to O
remember O
the O
name N
of O
an O
awesome O
hibachi N
style N
restaurant N
i H
visited O
while O
out O
there O
a O
couple N
years N

. O

I H
think O
it O
was O
in O
the O
Lincoln O
Square N
area N
but O
don't O
do O
n't O
quote O
me H
on O
that O
. O

It's O
' O
gimmick N
' O
was O
that O
you H
fill O
your H
bowl N
cafeteria N
- O
style N
from O
raw O
ingredients N
and O
leave O
it O
on O
the O
counter N
with O
a O
chopstick N
listing N
your H
table N
number N
on O
it O
. O

Four O
guys H
around O
a O
large O
square N
open O
hibachi N
cook H
your H
food N
, O
and O
when O
it's O
it O
's O
finished O
a O
server H
brings O
it O
to O
your H
table N
. O

All O
- O
you H
can O
- O
eat O
style N
deal N
. O

It O
was O
pretty O
epic O
as O
I H
remember O
and O
would O
love N

send O

the O
best O

to O
start N
a O
trip N
around O
the O
world N
? O

Well O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
about O
to O
graduate O
in O
less O
then O
a O
year N
, O
and O
I'm O
I H
'm O
planning O
to O
study N
medical O
school N
. O

But O
since O
in O
my H
country N
it O
lasts O
for O
minimum N
6 O
years N
, O
and O
I H
want O
to O
go O
aground O
the O
world N
, O
what O
do O
you H
think O
, O
should O
I H
do O
it O
before O
or O
after O
medical O
school N
? O

If O
you H
can O
afford O
to O
go O
before O
, O
then O
by O
all O
means O
, O
GO O
. O

If O
you H
have O
to O
wait O
, O
due O
to O
financial O
reasons N
, O
then O
wait O
. O

I H
would O
much O
rather O
put O
it O
off O
until O
I H
can O
afford O
to O
have O
the O
vacation N
of O
a O
lifetime N
as O
I'm O
I H
'm O
sure O
this O
trip N
is O
intended O
to O
be O
. O

Airfare N
alone O
will O
be O
incredibly O
expensive O
so O
make O
sure O
you H
have O
the O
money N
and O
of O
course O
free O
time N

take O
your H
time N

It O
sounds N
like O
a O

the O

requires O
a O
re-boot O
just O
like O
what O
happens O

a O

I H
want O
, O
whenever O
I H
want O
. O

Any O
suggestions N
would O
be O
really O
helpful O
, O
thanks N
! O

I H
usually O
use O
ZebraKlub O
. O

They O
basically O
buy O
daily O
deals O
from O
Groupon O
, O
Living O
Social O
, O
and O
all O
sorts N
of O
other O
places O
. O

So O
you H
can O
pretty O
much O
get O
whatever O
deal N
you H
want O
anytime O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
deals O
let O
you H
eat O
for O
500 O
ff O
, O
and O
some O
of O
the O
deals O
are O
even O
free O
. O

If O
you H
want O
to O
eat O
cheaply O
without O
worrying O
about O
all O
those O
daily O
deal N
emails N
every O
day N
, O
ZebraKlub O
should O
be O
perfect O
for O
you H
. O

Possibly O

a O

in O
there O
. O

give O
me H
a O

option N
for O
that O
too O
? O

I'll O
I H
'll O
choose O
the O
one O
that O
sounds N
the O
best O
after O
looking O
into O
all O
the O
fish N
:) O

I H

have O
a O
review N

but O
why O
in O
the O
hell N
would O
you H
name N
your H
business N
something O
that O
has O
the O

KKK O
.... O
is O
there O
something O
behind O
the O

this O

Fresh O
and O
Excellent O
Quality N

We H
order N
take O
out O
from O

all O
the O
time N
and O
we H
are O
never O
disappointed O
. O

The O
food N
is O
always O
fresh O
and O
delicious O
. O

It O
can O
be O
a O
little O
on O
the O
spicy O
side N
but O
just O
ask O
them O
exactly O
what O
you H
want O
and O
they O
are O
very O
helpful O
. O

I H
really O
want O
to O
like O
this O
place N
since O
I H
work O
right O
around O
the O
corner N
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
I've O
I H
've O
given O
it O
a O
couple N
of O
tries O
at O
different O
times N
and O
decided O
to O
stop O
going O
. O

The O
employees H
don't O
do O
n't O
really O
seem O
to O
enjoy O
what O
they O
are O
doing O
and O
it O
shows O
. O

Class N
act O
. O

It O
was O
late O
in O
the O
day N
and O
I H
was O
worried O
I H
would O
get O
charged O
an O
arm N
and O
a O
leg N
and O
have O
to O
wait O
forever O
. O

They O
picked O
my H
car N
up O
in O
Yarmouth O
and O
towed O
to O
Bath O
for O
a O
great O
price N
. O

Would O
do O
business N
with O
them O
again O

What O
also O
should O

in O

the O
growing O
push O

, O
the O

the O

were O
asked O
the O

question N

“ O
What O

Respondents H

Second O
, O
we H

Finally O
, O
we H
assessed O
the O
distribution N

In O

examine O
potential O

the O

The O

This O

corrected O
for O
the O

Thus O

, O
and O

as O
Rector O
of O
the O
university N
in O
1920 O
– O
21 O
. O

His O
early O
work O
focused O
primarily O
on O
language N
teaching O
reform N
and O
on O
phonetics N
, O
but O
he O
is O
best O
known O
for O
his O
later O
work O
on O
syntax N
and O
on O
language N
development N
. O

He O
advanced O
the O
theories N
of O
Rank O
and O
Nexus O
in O
Danish O
in O
two O
papers N
: O
Sprogets O
logik O
( O
1913 O
) O
and O
De O

grammatiske O
forbindelser O
( O

Jespersen O
in O
this O
theory N
of O
ranks N
removes O
the O
parts N
of O
speech N
from O
the O
syntax N
, O
and O
differentiates O
between O
primaries N
, O
secondaries N
, O
and O
tertiaries N
; O
e.g. O
in O
" O
well O
honed O
phrase N
, O
" O
" O
phrase N
" O
is O
a O
primary O
, O
this O
being O
defined O
by O
a O
secondary O
, O
" O
honed O
" O
, O
which O
again O
is O
defined O
by O
a O
tertiary O
" O
well O
" O
. O

The O
term N
Nexus O
is O
applied O
to O
sentences N
, O
structures N
similar O
to O
sentences N
and O
sentences N
in O
formation N
, O
in O
which O
two O
concepts N
are O
expressed O
in O
one O
unit N
; O
e.g. O
, O
it O
rained O
, O
he O
ran O
indoors O
. O

This O
term N
is O
qualified O
by O
a O
further O
concept N
called O
a O
junction N
which O
represents O
one O
idea N
, O
expressed O
by O
means O
of O
two O
or O
more O
elements N
, O
whereas O
a O
nexus N
combines O
two O
ideas N
. O

Junction N
and O
nexus N
proved O
valuable O
in O
bringing O

In O
The O

he O
challenged O
the O

Jespersen O
was O

wrote O
: O

“ O
Is O
there O
really O
much O
more O
logic N

the O
opposite O
extreme N
which O
denies O
any O
kind N

sound O
symbolism N
( O
apart O
from O
the O
small O
class N

evident O
echoisms O

‘ O
onomatopoeia N

) O
and O
sees O
in O
our H
words N
only O
a O
collection N
of O
accidental O

irrational O
associations N

sound O
and O
meaning O
? O
... O

There O
is O
no O
denying O
that O
there O
are O
words N

we H
feel O
instinctively O

adequate O

Sunday O
three O
four O
weeks N

Uh O

after O
the O
class N
is O
over O
w- O
over O
with O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
sitting O
down O
at O
a O
table N
, O
there's O
there O
's O
a O
woman H
from O
— O
who O
was O
in O
the O
class N
, O
and O
two O
men H
, O
sitting O
to O
my H
right O
, O
is O
a O
table N
with O
two O
women H
there O
. O

They O
had O
apparently O
just O
come O
from O
Oba O
Oba O
. O

On O
the O
last O
night N
— O

Oh O
I H
think O
you H
told O
me H
. O

The O
last O
night N
— O

Yeah O
. O

And O
like O
, O
well O
they O
were O
attractive O
women H
, O
the O
one O
had O
on O
a O
real O
real O
short O
skirt N
. O

Anyway O
, O
there O
was O
this O
guy H
in O
his O
fifties N
, O
out H
there O
dancing O
, O
by O
himself O
. O

And O
the O
woman H
was O
just O
looking O
at O
him O
, O
making O
eyes N
, O
then O
she O
went O
out H
there O
, O
got O
on O
her O
knees N
, O
in O
front N
of O
him O
, O
in O
this O
skirt N
that's O
that O
's O
this O
short O
, O
takes O
her O
hands N
, O
and O
goes O
along O
his O
toes N
, O
and O
then O
up O
, O
and O
is O
just O
doing O
like O
that O
. O

Ooh O
. O

I H
figured O
, O
oh O
, O
they O
must O
know O
each O
other O
. O

Ooh O
. O

Very O
well O
, O
in O
fact N
. O

Mhm O
. O

Gross O
. O

That's O
That O
's O
what O
I H
assumed O
. O

And O
, O
they O
did O
that O
for O
the O
whole O
dance N
, O
and O
I H
mean O
, O
she O
was O
d- O
all O
kind N
of O
suggestive O
stuff N
, O
and O
touching O
him O
and O
everything O
, O
people N
would O
like O
cheering O
, O
and O
clapping O
, O
" O
go O
for O
it O
" O
. O

And O
all O
this O
kind N
of O
thing N
? O

The O
– O
the O
song N
ended O
, O
the O
guy H
set O
down O
, O
at O
another O
table N
. O

And O
she O
set O
down O
— O

At O
a O
— O

At O
the O
table N
with O
her O
woman H
friend H
. O

They O
never O
danced O
again O
the O
rest N
of O
the O
evening N
. O

Hm O
. O

This O
is O
like O
— O
so O
I H
was O
thinking O
, O
this O
woman's O
woman H
's O
sitting O
about O
as O
far O
away O
from O
me H
as O
Jamie H
is O
. O

And O
I H
was O
thinking O
, O
hm O
, O
this O
is O
interesting O
. O

I H
wonder O
how O
long O
it O
was O
gonna O
gon O
na O
take O
the O
guys H
in O
this O
club N
to O
move O
in O
on O
her O
. O

No O
sooner O
did O
I H
think O
this O
thought O
, O
guys H
were O
over O
there O
. O

What O
, O
you H
didn't O
did O
n't O
ask O
her O
to O
dance N
? O

Not O
Miles H
, O
he's O
he O
's O
just O
in O
daze N
. O

Well O
I H
was O
still O
trying O
to O
figure N
out H
, O
surely O
they O
must O
know O
each O
other O
, O
I H
mean O
, O
why O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
he O
sitting O
at O
her O
table N
? O

You H
mean O
, O
you H
were O
still O
thinking O
about O
it O
. O

Anyway O
, O
this O
guy H
, O
I H
mean O
he O
comes O
over O
there O
, O
immediately O
afterwards O
— O

The O
same O
guy H
who O
got O
his O
— O
the O
same O
guy H
who's O
who O
's O
— O

No O
, O
it's O
it O
's O
just O
some O
random O
guy H
. O

Or O
just O
some O
random O
guy H
. O

No O
, O
a O
random O
guy H
, O
who O
was O
like O
sitting O
about O
where O
you H
are O
. O

Yeah O
. O

He O
was O
sitting O
there O
, O
there O
were O
two O
guys H
sitting O
at O
a O
table N
right O
where O
you H
are O
. O

And O
then O
these O
two O
women H
are O
sitting O
here O
. O

So O
uh O
, O
he O
comes O
over O
there O
, O
and O
is O
talking O
with O
that O
woman H
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
about O
what O
, O
but O
then O
like O
ten O
minutes N
later O
, O
she O
and O
her O
friend H
are O
over O
at O
their O
table N
. O

And O
then O
, O
twenty O
minutes N
later O
, O
they O
were O
kinda O
like O
all O
over O
each O
other O
. O

You H
know O
, O
kissing N
, O
et O
cetera O
, O
et O
cetera O
. O

And O
I H
was O
thinking O
, O
it O
looks O
like O
these O
people N
aren't O
are O
n't O
going O
home O
alone O
tonight N
. O

Gosh O
. O

But O
I H
just O
thought O
that O
— O

No O
wonder O
they O
forbid O
this O
dance N
. O

So O
— O

Oh O
my H
God O
, O
what O
a O
story N
. O

Well O
, O
maybe O
I H
shouldn't O
should O
n't O
go O
there O
then O
. O

Yeah O
, O
maybe O
you H
shouldn't O
should O
n't O
. O

Sam H
has O
been O
, O
has O
taken O
such O
an O
interest N
in O
this O
retirement N
bit N
that O
it O
— O
it O
really O
surprises O
me H
. O

Well O
she's O
she O
's O
begun O
to O
listen O
. O

Yes O
she O
has O
. O

You H
know O
. O

She O
has O
. O

Uh O
, O
she O
used O
to O
go O
over O
and O
read O
a O
book N
or O
something O
. O

Yeah O
, O
or O
turn N
a O
deaf O
ear N
. O

That O
was O
for O
sure O
. O

But O
uh O
, O
once O
you H
understand O
it O
, O
you H
know O
, O
you H
, O
you're O
you H
're O
interested O
in O
getting O
right O
in O
, O
and O
going O
after O
it O
. O

Yeah O
. O

I H
really O
ought O
a O
call N
, O
at O
least O
Reg H
Barr H
, O
and O
ask O
if O
uh O
, O
he's O
he O
's O
still O
speaking O
to O
me H
. O

Well O
now O
, O
he O
was O
the O
one O
that O
was O
up O
on O
the O
left O
, O
up O
there O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Yes O
. O

Well O
, O
he O
came O
over O
to O
you H
all O
smiles O
, O
I H
noticed O
. O

Yes O
. O

Well O
, O
we've O
we H
've O
known O
each O
other O
for O
thirty O
- O
some O
years N
, O
why O
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
he O
? O

But O
a- O
anyway O
, O
um O
, O
I H
was O
so O
glad O
that O
he O
opened O
up O
on O
this O
disclosure N
bit N
. O

Because O
it O
was O
Burns H
that's O
that O
's O
been O
objecting O
to O
our H
having O
it O
. O

Oh O
? O

And O
I H
knew O
this O
. O

So O
when O
he O
opened O
up O
on O
that O
, O
and O
she O
followed O
through O
, O
and O
told O
about O
her O
husband H
, O
you H
know O
? O

Not O
necessarily O
that O
she O
would O
approve O
of O
it O
, O
but O
at O
least O
she O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
disapproving O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Of O
it O
. O

Yeah O
. O

And O
uh O
, O
course O
Duvall O
might O
– O

And O
I H
– O
I H
cannot O
can O
not O
get O
over O
this O
. O

That O
man H
. O

I H
really O
cannot O
can O
not O
. O

And O
you H
know O
, O
he O
must O
have O
been O
thinking O
, O
when O
he O
said O
he O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
a O
political O
appointee H
, O
he O
must O
have O
been O
associating O
his O
relationship N
with O
Steitler O
. O

Oh O
. O

I H
really O
do O
believe O
that O
. O

Mhm O
. O

In O
his O
thinking O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
else O
he O
could O
have O
done O
it O
. O

That O
topples O
over O
. O

Um O
, O
but O
he O
didn't O
did O
n't O
say O
that O
. O

Oh O
? O

He O
said O
, O
I H
loved O
your H
hum- O
humor N
, O
uh O
, O
and O
I H
love N
you H
, O
but O
, O
I H
am O
not O
a O
political O
appointee H
. O

And O
his O
eyes N
were O
just O
snapping O
. O

And O
I H
said O
, O
Oh O
? O
How O
did O
you H
get O
on O
the O
board N
? O

Well O
he O
said O
, O
I H
got O
a O
letter N
from O
the O
governor H
, O
asking O
. O

Everybody O
on O
there O
is O
an O
app- H
political O
appointee H
, O
that O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
the O
point N
. O

The O
point N
was O
, O
I H
could O
have O
mentioned O
what O
was O
in O
the O
paper N
about O
him O
, O
that O
he O
was O
related O
and O
, O
you H
know O
, O
had O
business N
with O
Steitler O
, O
and O
I H
just O
said O
, O
and O
there's O
there O
's O
Doctor H
Duvall O
, O
you H
know O
? O

And O
then O
I H
went O
to O
Rotus O
, O
who's O
who O
's O
a O
seasoned O
politician H
, O
if O
there O
ever O
was O
one O
. O

Yeah O
. O

He O
just O
would O
flare O
. O

And O
I H
said O
, O
well O
, O
I H
– O

. O

I H
said O
, O

how O

board N
, O

watching O
her O
lean O
out H
. O

The O
wind N
whips O
her O
hair N

ruffles O
the O
skirt N
around O
her O
knees N

She O
must O
be O
a O
tourist H

You H
remember O
your H
first O
trip N
to O
the O
upper O

leaning O
over O
the O
edge N
into O
the O
angry O
swarm N
of O
mites N
, O
whirring O
and O
buzzing O
warnings N
and O
shoving O
you H
back N
like O
a O
million O
mosquito A

Everyone O
tries O
it O
once O
— O
Except O
that O
there O
aren’t O
are O
n’t O
any O
mites N
around O
her O
. O

You H
clutch O
the O
railing N

Hot O
, O
animal A
fear O
surges O
in O
your H
chest N

She O
looks O
up O
at O
you H
and O
, O
across O
the O
gap N
of O
forty O
meters N
, O
smiles O
a O
brilliant O
, O
heartbreaking O
smile N
. O

Then O
she O
lets O
go O
and O
falls N
. O

You H
scream O
. O

“ O
Fucking O

says O
Derya O

He O
steps N
off O
the O

tall O

the O

the O

of O
all O

you H
a O

finally O

A O

Perfect O
Teeth O

Steven H
wanted O
to O
be O
a O
dentist H
. O

It O
was O
pretty O
much O
the O
first O
thing N
he O
told O
us H
when O
, O
as O
first O
years N
, O
we H
were O
all O
bunched O
together O
in O
the O
unfamiliar O
dusty O
classroom N
. O

When O
, O
a O
couple N
of O
weeks N
later O
we H
were O
invited O
over O
to O
his O
house N
we H
saw O
that O
this O
was O
not O
an O
idle O
remark N
. O

Where O
our H
bedroom N
walls N
were O
decorated O
with O
posters N
of O
pop N
stars N
and O
footballers H
, O
Steven H
had O
diagrams N
setting O
out H
tooth N
implementations N
, O
anatomical O
drawings N
of O
the O
jaw N
with O
brightly O
coloured O
nerves N
, O
muscle N
, O
blood N
vessels N
, O
bones N
, O
and O
, O
of O
course O
, O
teeth N
. O

Where O
we H
had O
shelves N
of O
plastic N
dinosaurs A
and O
superhero O
figurines N
from O
cornflake O
boxes N
, O
Steven H
had O
plaster N
casts N
of O
jawbones N
, O
gums N
and O
teeth N
grinning O
down O
at O
us H
. O

The O
instruments N
were O
locked O
away O
in O
glass N
cabinets N
and O
only O
his O
parents H
had O
the O
key N
. O

“ O
They O
don’t O
do O
n’t O
exactly O
encourage O
my H
interest N
, O
” O
he O
shrugged O
. O

“ O
They O
sort N
of O
tolerate O
it O
. O

But O
Dad H
says O
they’re O
they O
’re O
a O
sort N
of O
collection N
, O
and O
too O
expensive O
for O
me H
to O
play N
with O
. O
” O

Of O
course O
, O
we H
tried O
to O
pick O
the O
locks N
, O
but O
the O
spikes N
and O
saws N
and O
drillheads O
remained O
— O
tantalisingly O
— O
out H
of O
reach N
. O

We H
didn’t O
did O
n’t O
see O
Steven’s O
Steven H
’s O
interest N
as O
strange O
, O
well O
, O
not O
that O
much O
. O

We H
all O
had O
our H
own O
interests N
— O
drawing N
, O
electronics N
, O
collecting O
beer N
caps N
— O
that O
each O
appeared O
obscure O
to O
anyone O
else O
. O

DIY O
Dentistry N
was O
just O
something O
that O
had O
never O
crossed O
our H
horizon N
before O
. O

And O
if O
Steven H
didn’t O
did O
n’t O
see O
it O
as O
weird O
, O
or O
no O
weirder O
than O
Andy H
showing O
us H
his O
Eastern O
- O
Block O
beer N
caps N
all O
laid O
out H
neatly O
on O
cork N
boards N
with O
little O
hand N
- O
written O
labels N
, O
why O
should O
it O
bother O
us H
? O

I H
suppose O
that O
, O
in O
our H
own O
way N
, O
we H
were O
all O
collectively O
strange O
. O

The O
bunch N
that O
no O
one O
picked O
for O
their O
side N
at O
football N
or O
hockey N
, O
and O
that O
was O
the O
glue N
that O
held O
us H
together O
. O

Besides O
, O
Steven H
had O
some O
really O
good O
stuff N
: O
sweets H
that O
stained O
your H
teeth N
bright O
red O
— O
well O
, O
technically O
, O
not O
your H
teeth N
, O
just O
the O
plaque N
, O
but O
the O
result N
was O
often O
the O
same O
. O

It O
took O
a O
few O
days N
good O
brushing N
to O
get O
it O
off O
. O

Well O
, O
most O
of O
it O
anyway O
. O

He O
had O
effervescent O
tablets N
that O
turned O
the O
canteen N
drinking N
water N
into O
that O
exact O
same O
pink O
mixture N
that O
the O
dentist H
gave O
you H
to O
rinse O
your H
mouth N
out H
after O
scraping O
around O
inside O
, O
and O
guaranteed O
to O
make O
the O
other O
kids H
splutter O
and O
spit N
it O
out H
when O
the O
taste N
slowly O
percolated O
through O
and O
met O
the O
memory N
of O
their O
last O
checkup N
. O

Then O
there O
was O
the O
event N
that O
became O
the O
rite N
of O
passage N
into O
our H
group N
of O
misfits H
and O
outcasts H
: O
making O
a O
mould N
of O
your H
teeth N
. O

It O
was O
inevitable O
that O
one O
of O
us H
, O
seeing O
the O
plaster N
casts N
on O
the O
shelf N
by O
Steven’s O
Steven H
’s O
bed N
would O
ask O
how O
they O
were O
done O
. O

It O
was O
just O
as O
inevitable O
that O
a O
few O
minutes N
later O
, O
Steven H
would O
be O
mixing O
up O
various O
powders N
and O
liquids N
, O
and O
pouring O
them O
into O
a O
horse A
- O
shoe N
shaped O
contraption N
. O

It O
wasn’t O
was O
n’t O
dangerous O
. O

At O
least O
, O
I H
suppose O
so O
. O

It O
was O
vaguely O
uncomfortable O
, O
and O
appeared O
sufficiently O
disturbing O
that O
we H
all O
volunteered O
each O
other O
in O
turn N
until O
, O
at O
last O
, O
Andy H
said O
he O
was O
game N
. O

And O
we H
were O
off O
. O

The O
hardest O
part N
was O
probably O
to O
overcome O
the O
gagging O
reflex N
that O
set O
in O
when O
you H
bit N
down O
into O
the O
acrid O
resin N
jelly N
and O
it O
flowed O
out H
and O
up O
and O
around O
, O
over O
teeth N
, O
gums N
and O
tongue N
. O

Your H
nose N
filled O
with O
what O
you H
imagined O
were O
fumes N
from O
the O
warm O
paste N
. O

And O
you H
seemed O
to O
be O
suddenly O
drowning O
in O
your H
own O
saliva N
. O

Things N
generally O
got O
better O
when O
Steven H
reminded O
you H
that O
you H
could O
actually O
breathe O
, O
and O
swallow O
, O
normally O
. O

He O
watched O
the O
second O
hand N
trotting O
round O
the O
dial N
of O
his O
watch O
mouthing O
the O
quarters N
, O
before O
poking O
the O
setting O
goo N
to O
check N
its O
consistency N
. O

Then O
, O
when O
he O
gave O
you H
the O
nod N
, O
you H
tried O
to O
prise O
your H
jaws N
apart O
. O

As O
the O
seal N
around O
your H
gums N
and O
teeth N
was O
pretty O
solid O
, O
you H
thought O
it O
would O
never O
come O
off O
, O
as O
the O
others O
giggled O
at O
your H
expressions N
and O
grimaces N
. O

Steven H
jiggled O
the O
handle O
that O
stuck O
out H
beyond O
your H
front N
teeth N
like O
some O
metallic O
duck’s O
duck A
’s O
bill O
, O
turning O
and O
twisting O
it O
most O
professionally O
and O
murmuring O
encouragements N
. O

And O
, O
then O
, O
with O
an O
awful O
sucking O
slurp O
, O
it O
came O
free O
. O

The O
initiated O
then O
revelled O
in O
retelling O
the O
gross O
sensation N
of O
having O
this O
evil N
- O
smelling O
plastic N
slug N
invade O
your H
mouth N
, O
while O
the O
others O
waited O
their O
turn N
with O
mixed O
trepidation N
and O
excitement N
. O

Raucous O
laughter N
greeted O
the O
suggestions N
of O
the O
other O
body N
parts N
that O
could O
receive O
the O
same O
treatment N
. O

The O
next O
part N
of O
the O
proceedings N
was O
less O
thrilling O
. O

Steven H
measured O
and O
mixed O
the O
plaster N
of O
Paris O
and O
prepared O
for O
the O
cast N
by O
using O
a O
bright O
blue O
putty N
to O
build O
up O
the O
form N
of O
the O
jaw N
, O
and O
shoring O
up O
gaps N
and O
holes N
. O

It O
get O
even O
less O
exciting O
when O
he O
said O
we’d O
we H
’d O
have O
to O
wait O
an O
hour N
while O
the O
plaster N
set O
real O
solid O
. O

But O
the O
next O
time N
we H
visited O
his O
room N
we H
got O
to O
marvel O
at O
our H
toothy O
grins N
labelled O
and O
lined O
up O
on O
the O
shelf N
. O

We H
were O
all O
perfectly O
happy O
with O
the O
result N
, O
even O
wanting O
one O
as O
a O
trophy N
until O
Steven H
passed O
an O
expert O
eye N
over O
them O
, O
pointing O
out H
here O
a O
gap N
, O
here O
a O
filling N
, O
and O
there O
a O
completely O
misaligned O
incisor N
. O

We H
were O
, O
he O
told O
us H
, O
mediocre O
specimens N
for O
his O
collection N
. O

It O
didn’t O
did O
n’t O
matter N
. O

We H
were O
all O
friends H
, O
a O
group N
bonded O
by O
the O
common O
experience N
of O
being O
able O
to O
see O
our H
teeth N
on O
Steven’s O

you H
have O
that O

you H

My H
Presidential O
qualifications N
are O
rooted O
in O
my H
service O
as O
an O
Officer O
in O
the O
United O
States O
Air O
Force O
. O

I H
took O
the O
Oath N
to O
our H
Constitution O
at O
22 O
years N
old O
. O

I H
understood O
it O
was O
an O
Oath N
to O
ALL O
of O
our H
people N
. O

Politicians H
profess O
an O
Oath N
to O
this O
nation N
but O
once O
in O
office N
pursue O
their O
party N
agenda N
and O
reward O
their O
voters H
. O

As O
President H
, O
I H
will O
serve O
ALL O
of O
the O
people N
in O
America O
, O
guided O
by O
the O
Constitution O
. O

Why O
run O
for O
president H
? O

Why O
not O
run O
for O
a O
lower O
office N
that O
you H
would O
be O
more O
likely O
to O
win O
and O
effect N

? O

When O
I H
was O
a O
young O
man H
in O
Air O
Force O
ROTC O
I H
was O
chosen O
to O
attend O
a O
unique O
Pilot H
Training O
Program N
called O
Euro- O
NATO O
Joint O

Pilot H
Training O

The O
Air O

only O
selected O
180 O
Officers H
a O
year N
from O
the O
Academy O
, O
Squadron O
Officer O
School O
and O
ROTC O
to O
attend O
. O

I H
volunteered O
for O
that O
program N
because O
I H
knew O
I H
wanted O
to O
be O
a O
Fighter N
Pilot H
and O
at O
the O
" O
Top O
of O
the O
Spear O
. O
" O

In O
those O
days N
it O
was O
all O
or O
nothing O
. O

If O
you H
graduated O
you H
were O
assigned O
a O
fighter N
, O
if O
you H
were O
not O
quite O
fighter N
pilot H
material O
you H
had O
no O
response N
to O
fly O
another O
aircraft N
, O
you H
were O
washed O
out H

Congress O
has O
proven O
itself O
ineffective O
as O
a O

To O
make O

in O

you H
must O
have O
the O
" O
Bully H
Pulpit N
" O
and O
speak O
to O
the O
People N

The O
President H
has O
that O
pulpit N

All O
or O

I H
never O
wanted O

in O
the O
Republican O
Party O
? O

My H
ties N
to O
the O
Republican O
party N
date N
back N
to O
1979 O
, O
when O
I H
volunteered O
for O
Ronald H
Reagan H
and O
his O
campaign N
in O
New O
Hampshire O
. O

In O
those O
days N
I H
believed O
there O
was O
a O
difference N
in O
the O
parties N
. O

Today O
, O
like O
many O
Americans H
, O
I H
am O
skeptical O
. O

I H
understand O
third O
party N
candidates H
have O
no O
success N
. O

I H
hope O
to O
lead N
the O
Republican O
party N
in O
a O
new O
direction N
for O
working O
class N
Americans H
. O

How O
do O
you H
plan N
to O
get O
into O
the O
Republican O
debates N
and O
make O
an O
impact N
on O
polls N
? O

In O
order N
to O
be O
invited O
to O
the O
debates N
, O
we H
must O
raise O
money N
and O
poll N
nationally O
. O

This O
is O
an O
effort N
that O
is O
underway O
. O

Recently O
we H
were O
listed O
in O
New O
Hampshire O
and O
listed O
nationally O
with O
Politics1 O
. O

If O
you H
do O
not O
receive O
the O
Republican O
nomination N
, O
would O
you H
consider O
running O
as O
a O
third O
party N
candidate H
? O

No O
, O
I H
will O
back N
the O
nominee H
of O
the O
Republican O
party N
in O
2016 O
. O

After O
that O
, O
I H
may O
reconsider O
. O

Other O
than O
yourself H
, O
which O
candidates H
have O
you H
supported O
for O
president H
in O
previous O
campaigns N
? O

I H
supported O
Reagan H
in O
80 O
and O
84 O
, O
supported O
[ O
George H
H. O
W. O
] O
Bush H
in O
88 O
and O
92 O
, O
supported O
[ O
Phil H
] O
Gramm O
in O
96 O
, O
[ O
supported O
George H
W. O
] O
Bush H
in O
2000 O
and O
, O
supported O
Romney H
in O

. O

What O
are O
your H
thoughts N
on O
the O
job N
Barack H
Obama H
has O
done O
as O
president H
? O

Specifically O
, O
what O
would O
you H
have O
done O
differently O
? O

President H
Obama H
has O
an O
agenda N
that O
represents O
the O
far O
left O
wing N
of O
his O
party N
. O

His O
use O
of O
the O
Presidency O
to O
further O
this O
agenda N
has O
in O
many O
ways N
been O
unconstitutional O
. O

Specifically O
, O
altering O
law N
once O
it O
is O
passed O
to O
accommodate O
his O
voting O
blocs N
. O

His O
direction N
to O
Eric H
Holder O
to O
enforce O
some O
laws N
and O
not O
others O
is O
another O
example N
. O

If O
elected O
, O
what O
would O
constitute O
a O
successful O
presidency N
for O
you H
? O

Achieving O
four O
goals N
: O

Term N
Limits N
for O
Congress O
and O
the O
Courts N
returning O
government N
to O
the O
People N
. O

Implementing O
a O
Tax O
System N
that O
allows O
working O
Americans H
making O
under O
$ O
250,000 O
to O
keep O
all O
of O
their O
money N
. O

Closing O
Loopholes N

that O
is O

Returning O

Security N

What O
individuals H
would O
you H
like O
to O
see O
in O
a O
Hill H

? O

I H
would O
like O
to O
bring O
People N
from O
the O
heartland N
of O
America O
that O
make O
this O
nation N
work O
. O

We H

Anything O

A O
final O

America O
is O
a O
nation N
that O

I H
believe O
it O
is O
our H

Interview N

What O
is O
the O
most O
important O
aspect N
of O
your H
background N
that O
voters H
should O
know O
about O
? O

I H
am O
the O
only O
candidate H
born O
and O
raised O
in O
Virginia O
, O
but O
also O
the O
only O
candidate H
who O
embodies O
both O
physically O
and O
philosophically O
the O
growing O
diversity N
of O
the O
commonwealth N
. O

( O
I H
am O
mixed O
- O
race N
( O
half O
- O
Chinese O
) O
and O
in O
an O
interracial O
marriage N
. O
) O

I H
am O
the O
only O
candidate H
who O
has O
studied O
both O
economics N
and O
law N
, O
and O
the O
only O
candidate H
with O
a O
background N
in O
technology N
entrepreneurship O
. O

Because O
of O
my H
academic O
and O
professional O
background N
, O
I H
understand O
the O
issues N
and O
challenges N
facing O
Virginia O
much O
better O
than O
the O
other O
candidates H
, O
and O
I H
am O
offering O
real O
solutions N
that O
can O
be O
appreciated O
across O
the O
political O
spectrum N
. O

I H
am O
the O
only O
candidate H
who O
believes O
in O
both O
economic O
freedom N
and O
personal O
liberty N
and O
the O
only O
candidate H
who O
stands O
on O
principle N
against O
cronyism N
and O
corporatism N
and O
in O
favor N
of O
the O
rule N
of O
law N
. O

What O
are O
your H
thoughts N
on O
the O
job N
Bob H
McDonnell H
has O
done O
as O
Governor H
of O
Virginia O
? O

What O
would O
you H
have O
done O
differently O
than O
him O
? O

McDonnell H
did O
well O
early O
in O
his O
term N
pushing O
back N
against O
Senate O
Democrats O
who O
wanted O
huge O
tax N
increases N
in O
response N
to O
major O
revenue N
shortfalls N
during O
the O
recession N
. O

Those O
early O
budget N
efforts N
are O
his O
highest O
achievements N
as O
Governor H
. O

More O
recently O
, O
he O
erred O
in O
accepting O
a O
transportation N
bill O
that O
had O
huge O
flaws N
and O
huge O
tax N
increases N
, O
rather O
than O
prioritizing O
spending O
and O
seeking O
more O
rational O
, O
efficient O
, O
decentralized O
transportation N
decision N
- O
making O
. O

He O
could O
have O
shown O
much O
greater O
leadership N
in O
pushing O
for O
tax N
reform N
, O
regulatory O
reform N
, O
and O
school N
choice N
. O

Of O
course O
, O
he O
showed O
ethical O
lapses N
in O
judgment N
. O

Compared O
to O
previous O
third O
party N
candidates H
at O
the O
gubernatorial O
level N
, O
you H
have O
done O
exceptionally O
well O
in O
opinion N
polling O
. O

What O
do O
you H
attribute O
that O
success N
to O
? O

Voters H
see O
the O
two O
- O
party N
system N
for O
the O
sham N
it O
has O
become O
. O

They O
are O
sick O
of O
the O
partisanship N
and O
nonsense N
and O
the O
total O
lack N
of O
substance N
in O
modern O
campaigns N
. O

Voters H
see O
the O
two O
major O
party N
nominees H
as O
exemplifying O
what O
is O
worst O
about O
their O
respective O
parties N
, O
and O
they O
want O
something O
better O
. O

Voters H
who O
meet O
me H
and O
hear O
me H
speak O
know O
that O
I H
am O
sincere O
, O
know O
that O
I H
understand O
the O
issues N
deeply O
and O
have O
workable O
solutions N
, O
and O
know O
that O
I H
stand O
on O
principle N
against O
cronyism N
and O
corporatism N
and O
in O
favor N
of O
the O
rule N
of O
law N
and O
the O
public O
interest N
. O

People N
like O
the O
fact N
that O
I H
stand O
for O
a O
Virginia O
that O
is O
both O
Open O
- O
minded O
and O
Open O
for O
Business N
. O

If O
elected O
governor H
, O
how O
will O
you H
be O
able O
to O
implement O
your H
agenda N
while O
dealing O
with O
a O
hostile O
legislature N
? O

There O
are O
precedents N
of O
independent O
governors H
dealing O
effectively O
with O
the O
legislature N
, O
and O
indeed O
a O
wise O
third O
- O
party N
governor H
can O
have O
greater O
effectiveness N
than O
a O
major O
party N
governor H
. O

Libertarians O
share O
many O
policy N
positions N
with O
each O
of O
the O
major O
parties N
. O

Working O
together O
with O
both O
Republicans O
and O
Democrats O
, O
we H
can O
get O
the O
good O
aspects N
of O
each O
party N
while O
rejecting O
the O
bad O
parts N
of O
both O
. O

Moreover O
, O
electing O
a O
third O
- O
party N
governor H
represents O
a O
repudiation N
of O
politics N
as O
usual O
, O
and O
the O
major O
party N
legislators H
will O
face N
changed O
constraints N
and O
incentives N
, O
meaning O
that O
much O
more O
is O
possible O
than O
many O
people N
assume O
, O
especially O
with O
strong O
leadership N
. O

Which O
previous O
Virginia O
Governor(s) O
do O
you H
most O
admire O
and O
why O
? O

Thomas H
Jefferson H
. O

He O
was O
incredibly O
learned O
and O
was O
a O
strong O
advocate H
for O
freedom N
and O
the O
rule N
of O
law N
. O

He O
would O
be O
a O
Libertarian O
today N
. O

Houston O
has O
played O
a O
critical O
role N
throughout O
the O
life N
of O

but O
it O
is O

The O

various O

is O
used O
by O

If O
someone O

the O

down O
, O
or O
hack O
inside O
and O
delete O
or O
corrupt O
the O

it O
could O
affect O
the O

Environment N
Minister O
John H

has O
asked O

how O
such O

are O
supposed O
to O
be O
stored O

" O
approved O

cabinets N
" O
wound N
up O
on O
the O
street N

" O
I'm O
I H
'm O
told O
two O
things N
: O
that O
it's O
it O
's O
neither O
classified O
nor O
secret O
and O
that O
it's O
it O
's O
stuff N
that O
could O
be O
available O
under O

" O
Baird H

Environment N
Canada O
spokeswoman H
Sujata O
Raisinghani O
told O
CBC O

the O
department N
will O
look O
into O
the O
incident N
. O

" O
We H
take O
document N
security N
seriously O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
but O
refused O
to O
give O
any O
more O
details N
about O
how O
the O
papers N
came O
to O
be O
on O
a O
road N
. O

Paul H
Dewar O
, O
an O
Ottawa O
New O
Democrat O
MP O
, O
said O
the O
combined O
security N
lapses N
raise O
serious O
questions N
about O
the O
government's O
government N
's O
ability N
to O
secure O
sensitive O
documents N
. O

Dewar O
says O
that O
bureaucrats H
of O
the O
Conservative O
government N
have O
complained O
to O
him O
about O
document N
security N
to O
the O
point N
that O
they O
can`t O
ca O
n`t O
share O
the O
information N
with O
their O
own O
colleagues H
. O

However O
, O
when O
a O
government N
document N
has O
been O
found O
on O
the O
streets N
, O
the O
government N
then O
says O
it O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
particularly O
sensitive O
. O

" O
This O
government N
is O
so O
consumed O
with O
control O
of O
information N
and O
secrecy N
yet O
they O
don't O
do O
n't O
seem O
to O
be O
able O
to O
get O
the O
fundamentals N
right O
, O
" O
Dewar O
said O
. O

The O
incident N
is O
a O
reminiscent O
of O
two O
other O
incidents N
. O

In O
March O
, O
a O
bundle N
of O

a O

were O
found O
stuffed O
in O
the O

on O
a O

In O
May O
, O
Maxime O

resign O

Arab O

that O
nobody O
expected O
when O
we H
met O
one O
year N

Pressure O

established O
. O

Austria O
fully O
stands O
behind O
the O
campaign N
launched O
by O
the O
Secretary O
- O
General O
on O
Monday N
to O
achieve O
universal O
access N
to O
modern O
energy N
services N
. O

We H
support O
doubling O
the O
rate N
of O
improvement N
in O
energy N
efficiency N
and O
the O
share O
of O
renewable O
energy N
in O
the O
global O

efforts N
undertaken O
by O

. O

Last O
June O
, O
we H
hosted O
the O
Vienna O
Energy O
Forum O
, O
where O
about O
1,400 O
participants H
discussed O
alternative O
energy N
concepts N
to O
reach N
the O
energy N
goals N
of O
the O
United O
Nations N
. O

The O
Fukushima O
nuclear O
catastrophe N
should O
become O
a O
turning O
point N
in O
our H
approach N
to O
nuclear O
safety N
. O

We H
owe O
it O
to O
future N
generations N
to O
make O
safety N
concerns N
come O
first O
when O
using O
nuclear O
power N
. O

Austria O
decided O
, O
in O
1978 O
, O
to O
forgo O
the O
use O
of O
nuclear O
energy N
. O

Some O
countries N
have O
recently O
adopted O
a O
similar O
course O
, O
which O
we H
welcome O
. O

I H
wish O
to O
make O
a O
ministerial O
statement N
about O
the O
first O
confirmed O
case N
of O
COVID O
- O
19 O
in O
New O
Zealand O
. O

On O
Friday N
, O
28 O
February O
, O
New O
Zealand O
recorded O
its O
first O
case N
of O
the O
COVID O
- O
19 O
coronavirus O
, O
becoming O
the O
48th O
country N
to O
have O
a O
confirmed O
case N
. O

The O
individual O
had O
entered O
the O
country N
two O
days N
earlier O
after O
spending O
some O
weeks N
in O
Iran O
, O
which O
is O
currently O
experiencing O
a O
sizable O
outbreak N
of O
the O
disease N
. O

I H
can O
report N
to O
the O
House N
that O
they O
are O
currently O
in O
a O
stable O
and O
improving O
condition N
at O
Auckland O
Hospital O
. O

The O
good O
news N
in O
this O
instance N
is O
that O
the O
individual O
had O
limited O
contact O
with O
people N
upon O
their O
return O
to O
the O
country N
, O
and O
their O
family N
took O
all O
the O
appropriate O
measures N
when O
presenting O
at O
the O
emergency N
department N
. O

As O
you H
would O
expect O
, O
our H
public O
health N
service O
is O
working O
hard O
to O
contain O
this O
first O
case N
and O
limit N
the O
risk N
of O
any O
spread N
of O
the O
disease N
. O

Contact N
tracing O
began O
immediately O
and O
has O
gone O
to O
plan N
. O

All O
15 O
people N
who O
were O
seated O
nearby O
the O
individual O
on O
their O
flight N
into O
New O
Zealand O
have O
been O
traced O
and O
are O
being O
told O
to O
self O
- O
isolate O
. O

Public O
health N
staff N
will O
remain O
in O
touch O
with O
individuals H
to O
monitor O
the O
situation N
and O
give O
ongoing O
advice N
. O

All O
but O
10 O
of O
the O
remaining O
passengers H
on O
the O
flight N
, O
who O
are O
not O
considered O
to O
be O
close O
contacts N
, O
have O
also O
been O
contacted O
to O
provide O
reassurance N
and O
answer N
any O
questions N
they O
might O
have O
; O
those O
10 O
that O
haven't O
have O
n't O
been O
contacted O
did O
not O
provide O
accurate O
contact O
information N
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
advised O
that O
as O
a O
result N
of O
our H
decisive O
response N
, O
the O
chance N
of O
an O
outbreak N
from O
our H
first O
case N
is O
low O
. O

Internationally O
, O
the O
situation N
with O
COVID O
- O
19 O
continues O
to O
develop O
at O
pace N
. O

However O
, O
the O
Director H
- O
General O
of O
the O
World O
Health N
Organization O
said O
, O
this O
morning N
, O
containment N
… O
is O
feasible O
and O
must O
remain O
the O
top N
priority N
for O
all O
countries N
. O

This O
is O
exactly O
the O
approach N
that O
New O
Zealand O
is O
taking O
, O
using O
three O
main O
tools N
: O
border N
controls N
; O
self O
- O
isolation N
; O
and O
good O
public O
health N
practices N
, O
including O
highlighting O
the O
importance N
of O
basic O
hygiene N
. O

At O
every O
step O
, O
the O
Government N
has O
taken O
decisions N
in O
the O
interests N
of O
health N
and O
safety N
of O
the O
wider O
public O
, O
and O
so O
far O
we H
have O
been O
among O
the O
best O
at O
keeping O
COVID O
- O
19 O
at O
bay N
. O

Just O
yesterday N
, O
Cabinet O
decided O
to O
extend O
for O
another O
week N
the O
travel O
restrictions N
that O
have O
been O
in O
place N
for O
China O
since O
3 O
February O
and O
in O
place N
for O
Iran O
since O
last O
Friday N
. O

These O
restrictions N
have O
played O
a O
key N
role N
in O
keeping O
COVID O
- O
19 O
out H
of O
New O
Zealand O
for O
so O
long O
and O
have O
given O
us H
time N
to O
better O
understand O
the O
disease N
and O
ramp O
up O
our H
preparations N
. O

Of O
course O
, O
members N
will O
be O
aware O
that O
there O
are O
outbreaks N
in O
other O
regions N
as O
well O
. O

So O
, O
as O
a O
further O
precaution N
, O
we H
have O
decided O
that O
anyone O
arriving O
in O
New O
Zealand O
who O
has O
been O
in O
northern O
Italy O
or O
South O
Korea O
who O
has O
been O
there O
in O
the O
last O
14 O
days N
will O
be O
registered O
for O
self O
- O
isolation N
. O

This O
is O
based O
on O
an O
expert O
assessment N
of O
risk N
. O

It O
recognises O
that O
while O
there O
are O
outbreaks N
in O
both O
countries N
, O
they O
also O
have O
well O
- O
developed O
health N
systems N
and O
the O
outbreaks N
are O
largely O
located O
in O
specific O
regions N
. O

We H
know O
self O
- O
isolation N
works N
. O

It O
is O
a O
longstanding O
and O
successful O
approach N
to O
managing O
infectious O
diseases N
and O
has O
proven O
its O
worth O
again O
in O
recent O
weeks N
. O

We H
have O
also O
stepped O
up O
the O
health N
presence N
at O
our H
airports N
. O

All O
airlines N
flying O
into O
New O
Zealand O
have O
been O
requested O
to O
read O
a O
health N
message N
upon O
landing N
, O
and O
all O
arrivals N
into O
New O
Zealand O
will O
receive O
health N
information N
cards N
alongside O
the O
standard O
customs N
declaration N
form N
. O

As O
a O
result N
of O
decisions N
taken O
on O
Friday N
, O
health N
staff N
are O
meeting N
all O
direct O
international O
flights N
landing N
in O
New O
Zealand O
airports N
from O
Hong O
Kong O
, O
Japan O
, O
South O
Korea O
, O
Singapore O
, O
and O
Thailand O
. O

Our H
border N
response N
is O
further O
ramping O
up O
to O
have O
health N
staff N
available O
for O
all O
international O
flights N
into O
New O
Zealand O
. O

All O
these O
decisions N
and O
actions N
are O
designed O
to O
limit N
the O
spread N
of O
any O
sporadic O
COVID O
- O
19 O
cases N
that O
might O
arrive O
in O
New O
Zealand O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time N
, O
our H
health N
system N
continues O
its O
preparations N
in O
line N
with O
our H
comprehensive O
pandemic N
plan N
. O

I H
want O
to O
thank O
our H
DHBs O
, O
public O
health N
staff N
, O
and O
primary O
care N
and O
health N
officials H
for O
the O
work O
they O
are O
doing O
to O
protect O
the O
public O
. O

I H
have O
high O
confidence N
in O
our H
medical O
professionals H
. O

We H
have O
a O
strong O
public O
health N
system N
. O

We H
continue O
to O
work O
to O
keep O
COVID O
- O
19 O
out H
, O
but O
we H
are O
ready O
if O
it O
arrives O

2.1 O
Early O
Ideas N
in O
Atomic O
Theory N

By O
the O
end N
of O
this O
section N
, O
you H
will O
be O
able O
to O
: O

State N
the O
postulates N
of O
Dalton’s O
Dalton H
’s O
atomic O
theory N

Use O
postulates N
of O
Dalton’s O
Dalton H
’s O
atomic O
theory N
to O
explain O
the O
laws N
of O
definite O
and O
multiple O
proportions N

The O
earliest O
recorded O
discussion N
of O
the O
basic O
structure N
of O
matter N
comes O
from O
ancient O
Greek O
philosophers H
, O
the O
scientists H
of O
their O
day N
. O

In O
the O
fifth O
century N
BC O
, O
Leucippus O
and O
Democritus O
argued O
that O
all O
matter N
was O
composed O
of O
small O
, O
finite O
particles N
that O
they O
called O
atomos O
, O
a O
term N
derived O
from O
the O
Greek O
word N
for O
“ O
indivisible O
. O
” O

They O
thought O
of O
atoms N
as O
moving O
particles N
that O
differed O
in O
shape N
and O
size N
, O
and O
which O
could O
join O
together O
. O

Later O
, O
Aristotle H
and O
others O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion N
that O
matter N
consisted O
of O
various O
combinations N
of O
the O
four O
“ O
elements N
” O
— O
fire N
, O
earth N
, O
air N
, O
and O
water N
— O
and O
could O
be O
infinitely O
divided O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
these O
philosophers H
thought O
about O
atoms N
and O
“ O
elements N
” O
as O
philosophical O
concepts N
, O
but O
apparently O
never O
considered O
performing O
experiments N
to O
test O
their O
ideas N
. O

The O
Aristotelian O
view N
of O
the O
composition N
of O
matter N
held O
sway N
for O
over O
two O
thousand O
years N
, O
until O
English N
schoolteacher H
John H
Dalton H
helped O
to O
revolutionize O
chemistry N
with O
his O
hypothesis N
that O
the O
behavior N
of O
matter N
could O
be O
explained O
using O
an O
atomic O
theory N
. O

First O
published O
in O
1807 O
, O
many O
of O
Dalton’s O
Dalton H
’s O
hypotheses N
about O
the O
microscopic O
features N
of O
matter N
are O
still O
valid O
in O
modern O
atomic O
theory N
. O

Here O
are O
the O
postulates N
of O
Dalton’s O
Dalton H
’s O
atomic O
theory N
. O

1. O
Matter N
is O
composed O
of O
exceedingly O
small O
particles N
called O
atoms N

An O
atom N
is O
the O
smallest O
unit N

an O
element N
that O
can O
participate O
in O
a O
chemical N
change O
. O

2. O
An O
element N
consists O
of O
only O
one O
type N
of O
atom N
, O
which O
has O
a O
mass N
that O
is O
characteristic O
of O
the O
element N
and O
is O
the O
same O
for O
all O
atoms N
of O
that O
element N
( O

A O
macroscopic O
sample N

all O
of O
which O
have O
identical O
chemical N
properties N

then O
it O

Objectives N

By O
the O
end N
of O
this O
section N
, O
you H
will O
be O
able O
to O
: O

Describe O
the O
reasons N
why O
many O
Americans H
doubted O
that O
Abraham H
Lincoln H
would O
be O
reelected O

Explain O
how O
the O
Union N
forces N
overpowered O
the O
Confederacy O

Describe O
the O
contributions N
and O
experiences N
of O
African O
Americans H
serving O
in O
the O
Civil O
War N

By O
the O
outset N
of O
1864 O
, O
after O
three O
years N
of O
war N
, O
the O
Union N
had O
mobilized O
its O
resources N
for O
the O
ongoing O
struggle N
on O
a O
massive O
scale N
. O

The O
government N
had O
overseen O
the O
construction N
of O
new O
railroad N
lines N
and O
for O
the O
first O
time N
used O
standardized O
rail N
tracks N
that O
allowed O
the O
North O
to O
move O
men H
and O
materials N
with O
greater O
ease N
. O

The O
North’s O
North O
’s O
economy N
had O
shifted O
to O
a O
wartime N
model N
. O

The O
Confederacy O
also O
mobilized O
, O
perhaps O
to O
a O
greater O
degree N
than O
the O
Union N
, O
its O
efforts N
to O
secure O
independence N
and O
maintain O
slavery N
. O

Yet O
the O
Confederacy O
experienced O
ever O
- O
greater O
hardships N
after O
years N
of O
war N
. O

Without O
the O
population N
of O
the O
North O
, O
it O
faced O
a O
shortage N
of O
manpower N
. O

The O
lack N
of O
industry N
, O
compared O
to O
the O
North O
, O
undercut O
the O
ability N
to O
sustain O
and O
wage O
war N
. O

Rampant O
inflation N
as O
well O
as O
food N
shortages N
in O
the O
South O
lowered O
morale N
. O

THE O
RELATIONSHIP N
WITH O
EUROPE O

From O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
war N
, O
the O
Confederacy O
placed O
great O
hope O
in O
being O
recognized O
and O
supported O
by O
Great O
Britain O
and O
France O
. O

European O
intervention N
in O
the O
conflict N
remained O
a O
strong O
possibility N
, O
but O
when O
it O
did O
occur O
, O
it O
was O
not O
in O
a O
way N
anticipated O
by O
either O
the O
Confederacy O
or O
the O
Union N
. O

Napoleon H
III O
of O
France O
believed O
the O
Civil O
War N
presented O
an O
opportunity N
for O
him O
to O
restore O
a O
French N
empire N
in O
the O
Americas O
. O

With O
the O
United O
States O
preoccupied O
, O
the O
time N
seemed O
ripe O
for O
action N
. O

Napoleon’s O
Napoleon H
’s O
target N
was O
Mexico O
, O
and O
in O
1861 O
, O
a O
large O
French N
fleet N
took O
Veracruz O
. O

The O
French N
then O
moved O
to O
capture N
Mexico O
City N
, O
but O
the O
advance N
came O
to O
an O
end N
when O
Mexican O
forces N
defeated O
the O
French N
in O
1862 O
. O

Despite O
this O
setback N
, O
France O
eventually O
did O
conquer O
Mexico O
, O
establishing O
a O
regime N
that O
lasted O
until O
1867 O
. O

Rather O
than O
coming O
to O
the O
aid N
of O
the O
Confederacy O
, O
France O
used O
the O
Civil O
War N
to O
provide O
a O
pretext N
for O
efforts N
to O
reestablish O
its O
former O
eighteenth O
- O
century N
colonial O
holdings N
. O

Still O
, O
the O
Confederacy O
had O
great O
confidence N
that O
it O
would O
find O
an O
ally N
in O
Great O
Britain O
despite O
the O
antislavery O
sentiment N
there O
. O

Southerners O
hoped O
Britain’s O
Britain O
’s O
dependence N
on O
cotton N
for O
its O
textile N
mills N
would O
keep O
the O
country N
on O
their O
side N
. O

The O
fact N
that O
the O
British O
proved O
willing O
to O
build O
and O
sell O
ironclad O
ships N
intended O
to O
smash O
through O
the O
Union N
naval O
blockade N
further O
raised O
Southern O
hopes N
. O

The O
Confederacy O
purchased O
two O
of O
these O
armored O
blockade N
runners H
, O
the O
CSS O
Florida O
and O
the O
CSS O
Alabama O
. O

Both O
were O
destroyed O
during O
the O
war N
. O

The O
Confederacy’s O
Confederacy O
’s O
staunch O
commitment N
to O
slavery N
eventually O
worked O
against O
British O
recognition N
and O
support O
, O
since O
Great O
Britain O
had O
abolished O
slavery N
in O
1833 O
. O

The O
1863 O
Emancipation O
Proclamation O
ended O
any O
doubts N
the O
British O
had O
about O
the O
goals N
of O
the O
Union N
cause O
. O

In O
the O
aftermath N
of O
the O
proclamation N
, O
many O
in O
Great O
Britain O
cheered O
for O
a O
Union N
victory N
. O

Ultimately O
, O
Great O
Britain O
, O
like O
France O
, O
disappointed O
the O
Confederacy’s O
Confederacy O
’s O
hope O
of O
an O
alliance N
, O
leaving O
the O
outnumbered O
and O
out H
- O
resourced O
states O
that O
had O
left O
the O
Union N
to O
fend O
for O
themselves O

AFRICAN O
AMERICAN O
SOLDIERS H

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
war N
, O
in O
1861 O
and O
1862 O
, O
Union N
forces N
had O
used O
contrabands N
, O
or O
escaped O
enslaved O
people N
, O
for O
manual O
labor N
. O

The O
Emancipation O
Proclamation O
, O
however O
, O
led O
to O
the O
enrollment N
of O
African O
American O
men H
as O
Union N
soldiers H
. O

Huge O
numbers N
of O
formerly O
enslaved O
as O
well O
as O
free O
Black O
people N
from O
the O
North O
enlisted O
, O
and O
by O
the O
end N
of O
the O
war N
in O
1865 O
, O
their O
numbers N
had O
swelled O
to O
over O
190,000 O
. O

Racism N
among O
White H
people N
in O
the O
Union N
army N
ran O
deep O
, O
however O
, O
fueling O
the O
belief N
that O
Black O
soldiers H
could O
never O
be O
effective O
or O
trustworthy O
. O

The O
Union N
also O
feared O
for O
the O
fate N
of O
captured O
Black O
soldiers H
. O

Although O
many O
Black O
soldiers H
saw O
combat N
duty N
, O
these O
factors N
affected O
the O
types N
of O
tasks N
assigned O
to O
them O
. O

Many O
Black O
regiments N
were O
limited O
to O
hauling O
supplies N
, O
serving O
as O
cooks H
, O
digging O
trenches N
, O
and O
doing O
other O
types N
of O
labor N
, O
rather O
than O
serving O
on O
the O
battlefield N

advantages N

African O
American O

an O
extensive O
railroad N

( O

African O
American O
soldiers H
also O
received O
lower O
wages N

their O
White H
counterparts N
: O
ten O
dollars N
per O
month N

with O
three O
dollars N

White H
soldiers H
, O
in O
contrast N
, O
received O
thirteen O
dollars N
monthly O
, O
with O
no O
deductions N
. O

Abolitionists H
and O
their O
Republican O
supporters H
in O
Congress O
worked O
to O
correct O
this O
discriminatory O
practice N
, O
and O
in O
1864 O
, O
Black O
soldiers H
began O
to O
receive O
the O
same O
pay O
as O
White H
soldiers H
plus O
retroactive O
pay O

the O

army N
pose O
together O
in O
this O
photograph N

although O
in O
reality N
, O
Black O
soldiers H
were O
often O
kept O
separate O
and O
given O
only O
menial O
jobs N
. O

For O
their O
part N
, O
African O
American O
soldiers H
welcomed O
the O
opportunity N
to O
prove O
themselves O
. O

Some O
85 O
percent N
were O
formerly O
enslaved O
people N
who O
were O
fighting O
for O
the O
liberation N
of O
all O
of O
the O
enslaved O
and O
the O
end N
of O
slavery N
. O

When O
given O
the O
opportunity N
to O
serve O
, O
many O
Black O
regiments N
did O
so O
heroically O
. O

One O
such O
regiment N
, O
the O
Fifty O
- O
Fourth O
Regiment O
of O
Massachusetts O
Volunteers O
, O
distinguished O
itself O
at O
Fort O
Wagner O
in O
South O
Carolina O
by O
fighting O
valiantly O
against O
an O
entrenched O
Confederate O
position N
. O

They O
willingly O
gave O
their O
lives N
for O
the O
cause O
. O

The O
Confederacy O
, O
not O
surprisingly O
, O
showed O
no O
mercy N
to O
African O
American O
troops N
. O

In O
April O
1864 O
, O
Southern O
forces N
attempted O
to O
take O
Fort O
Pillow O
in O
Tennessee O
from O
the O
Union N
forces N
that O
had O
captured O
it O
in O
1862 O
. O

Confederate O
troops N
under O
Major O
General O
Nathan H
Bedford H
Forrest H
, O
the O
future N
founder H
of O
the O
Ku O
Klux O
Klan O
, O
quickly O
overran O
the O
fort O
, O
and O
the O
Union N
defenders H
surrendered O
. O

Instead O
of O
taking O
the O
African O
American O
soldiers H
prisoner H
, O
as O
they O
did O
the O
White H
soldiers H
, O
the O
Confederates O
executed O
them O
. O

The O
massacre N
outraged O
the O
North O

and O
the O
Union N
refused O
to O
engage O
in O
any O
future N
exchanges N
of O
prisoners H
with O
the O
Confederacy O
. O

What O
is O
up O
guys H
? O

Kharma O
Medic O
here O
and O
welcome O
back N
to O
another O
dose N
. O

So O
in O
today's O
today N
's O
video N
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
finally O
gonna O
gon O
na O
be O
doing O
a O
room N
tour N
. O

I H
know O
this O
is O
something O
that O
you H
guys H
have O
requested O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time N
, O
and O
after O
two O
and O
a O
half O
years N
of O
living O
here O
, O
I H
finally O
feel O
like O
I've O
I H
've O
made O
it O
my H
own O
and O
decorated O
it O
how O
I H
want O
, O
and O
I'm O
I H
'm O
ready O
to O
show O
it O
to O
you H
guys H
. O

Alright O
so O
let's O
let O
's H
start N
off O
with O
the O
bed N
and O
the O
couch N
area N
. O

Honestly O
, O
if O
I H
was O
redoing O
this O
from O
the O
beginning O
, O
I H
would O
have O
really O
liked O
to O
have O
a O
double O
bed N
in O
this O
room N
, O
but O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
with O
the O
space N
as O
you H
can O
probably O
see O
from O
that O
wall N
there O
till O
the O
door N
, O
it's O
it O
's H
basically O
just O
enough O
to O
fit O
a O
bed N
and O
a O
couch N
, O
and O
this O
is O
my H
couch N
over O
here O
. O

I've O
I H
've O
recently O
changed O
it O
, O
and O
if O
you've O
you H
've O
been O
following O
my H
channel N
for O
a O
long O
time N
, O
then O
you'll O
you H
'll O
know O
I'm O
I H
'm O
really O
proud O
of O
how O
I H
color O
match O
the O
pictures N
on O
the O
wall N
over O
here O
with O
sort N
of O
the O
gray O
and O
yellow O
vibe N
, O
the O
gray O
and O
yellow O
cushions N
. O

This O
couch N
is O
also O
quite O
big O
, O
it O
fits O
three O
people N
quite O
comfortably O
, O
and O
if O
I H
have O
family N
or O
friends H
staying O
over O
, O
it O
opens O
up O
into O
a O
full O
double O
bed N
. O

This O
coffee N
table N
over O
here O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
glass N
and O
has O
two O
levels N
, O
so O
it's O
it O
's H
really O
good O
when O
we H
have O
multiple O
friends H
over O
, O
and O
we H
have O
lots N
of O
food N
to O
put O
on O
the O
table N
, O
or O
if O
we're O
we H
're O
playing O
board N
games N
, O
we H
can O
have O
people N
sit O
around O
it O
, O
and O
still O
have O
a O
lot N
of O
space N
to O
lay O
everything O
out H
. O

So O
there's O
there O
's H
nothing O
too O
special O
about O
the O
bed N
itself O
, O
but O
it O
does O
have O
a O
very O
important O
function N
, O
which O
, O
it O
has O
a O
lot N
of O
storage N
. O

So O
down O
here O
is O
basically O
where O
I H
keep O
everything O
that O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
really O
keep O
in O
my H
room N
, O
because O
there's O
there O
's H
not O
enough O
space N
. O

I've O
I H
've O
got O
an O
ironing N
board N
, O
all O
of O
my H
suitcases N
, O
socks N
, O
clothes N
that O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
wear O
that O
often O
, O
anything O
that O
I H
need O
for O
fixing O
the O
house N
like O
screwdrivers N
, O
drills N
, O
nails N
, O
all O
these O
things N
that O
I H
definitely O
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
want O
to O
have O
laid O
out H
in O
my H
room N
, O
but O
I H
still O
need O
somewhere O
in O
the O
house N
. O

I H
love N
that O
this O
room N
has O
floor N
- O
to O
- O
ceiling N
windows N
as O
well O
, O
it O
really O
lets O
the O
light O
come O
in O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
summer N
time N
. O

I H
know O
London O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
have O
that O
much O
light O
, O
but O
I'll O
I H
'll O
take O
as O
much O
as O
I H
can O
, O
and O
there's O
there O
's H
also O
a O
small O
balcony N
out H
here O
, O
which O
is O
fairly O
rare O
for O
London O
. O

We H
have O
two O
chairs O
where O
we H
can O
sit O
down O
and O
sort N
of O
enjoy O
the O
weather N
when O
it O
is O
a O
little O
bit N
better O
, O
um O
but O
now O
it's O
it O
's H
really O
cold O
so O
just O
gonna O
gon O
na O
close O
it O
. O

And O
then O
a O
little O
behind O
the O
scenes N
that O
you H
probably O
will O
never O
see O
again O
in O
a O
video N
is O
that O
down O
here O
I H
keep O
all O
of O
the O
filming O
gear N
that O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
really O
fit O
anywhere O
else O
in O
the O
room N
: O
two O
sets N
of O
tripods N
, O
I H
also O
have O
a O
c N
- O
stand O
. O

Okay O
next O
to O
my H
bed N
, O
I've O
I H
've O
got O
the O
radio N
alarm N
clock N
, O
and O
this O
has O
actually O
changed O
my H
life N
. O

It O
makes O
waking O
up O
in O
the O
morning N
and O
getting O
out H
of O
bed N
at O
6:00 O
a.m. O
when O
it's O
it O
's H
pitch N
black O
outside O
so O
much O
easier O
when O
you're O
you H
're O
waking O
up O
really O
early O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
so O
much O
better O
to O
wake O
up O
to O
the O
sound O
of O
somebody O
talking O
to O
you H
: O
your H
favorite O
radio N
station N
, O
some O
music N
, O
whatever O
, O
instead O
of O
that O
classic O
iPhone O
alarm N
, O
" O
ba O
, O
ba O
, O
ba O
. O
" O

Over O
here O
on O
the O
wall N
, O
these O
are O
posters N
that O
I H
actually O
bought O
back N
in O
2013 O
in O
my H
first O
year N
of O
university N
in O
Toronto O
, O
and O
I H
really O
really O
liked O
them O
so O
I've O
I H
've O
kept O
them O
around O
. O

Also O
I'm O
I H
'm O
really O
proud O
that O
I H
managed O
to O
put O
them O
up O
all O
by O
myself H
, O
they O
look O
quite O
neat O
, O
and O
I H
feel O
like O
they're O
they O
're O
equally O
spaced O
, O
so O
I'm O
I H
'm O
really O
proud O
of O
how O
they O
turned O
out H
. O

Hey O
what's O
what O
's H
up O
guys H
? O

Welcome N
back N
to O
my H
channel N
or O
welcome O
if O
you're O
you H
're O
new O

Today O
I'm O
I H
'm O
doing O
another O
college N
day N
in O
my H
life N
. O

And O
I H
just O
left O
Starbucks O
, O
don't O
do O
n't O

And O

I'm O
I H
'm O

. O

I H
basically O
like O

a O
digital O
calendar N
where O
I'm O
I H
'm O
gonna O
gon O
na O
go O
over O
each O
of O
the O

study N
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
back N
home O
now O

and O
I H
basically O
just O
typed O
up O
a O
little O
calendar N
laying O
out H
the O
chapters N
that O
I H
have O
left O
to O
review N
before O

That's O
That O
's H

final O
list N
and O
I H
hate O
that O
, O
like O

is O
our H
Thanksgiving O
break O
and O
then O
we H
literally O
come O
back N
Tuesday O
and O
take O

So O
I'm O
I H
'm O
gonna O

, O
Black O
Friday N
, O

and O
I H
I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
decorating O
I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
doing O
anything O
fun N
, O
like O
I H
have O
to O
study N
. O

I H
thought O
I H
would O
show O
you H
guys H
kind N
of O
how O
I'm O
I H
'm O
mapping N
this O
out H
, O
because O
it's O
it O
's H
a O
really O
good O
tip N
if O
you H
have O
like O
a O
lot N
to O
do O
. O

So O
today N
I'm O
I H
'm O
doing O
female O
reproductive O
system N
, O
doing O
male H
reproductive O
system N
tomorrow N
. O

I H
work O
on O
Wednesday O
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
going O
to O
go O
over O
chapter N
29 O
fluid N
balance N
, O
chapter N
28 O
so O
urinary O
system N
on O
the O
29th O
. O

The O
30th O
, O
Chapters N
17 O
through O
22 O
- O
yes O
that's O
that O
's H
like O
six O
chapters N
or O
something O
. O

And O
then O
on O
Sunday O
, O
I'll O
I H
'll O
be O
doing O
chapters N
23 O
through O
27 O
and O
I H
just O
made O
this O
on O
my H
iPad O
and O
then O
printed O
it O
. O

I H
did O
not O
include O
my H
schedule N
for O
college N
algebra N
because O
I H
have O
a O
final O
on O
Thursday O
of O
next O
week N
for O
that O
. O

So O
I'm O
I H
'm O
going O
to O
go O
in O
with O
like O
a O
different O
color O
and O
add O
in O
the O
chapters N
I'm O
I H
'm O
gonna O
gon O
na O
be O
studying O
for O
that O
, O
but O
I'm O
I H
'm O
super O
stressed O
. O

I H
bought O
these O
Vans O
from O
DSW O
. O

They O
are O
really O
cute O
. O

You H
guys H
know O
I H
have O
the O
white O
ones O
and O
I H
wear O
them O
all O
the O
time N
and O
these O
ones O
are O
just O
like O
black O
perforated O
Vans O
. O

I H
love N
them O
and O
they O
are O
definitely O
the O
right O
size N
because O
I H
have O
two O
other O
pairs N
of O
Vans O
that O
are O
this O
size N
, O
but O
one O
of O
these O
ones O
is O
like O
messed O
up O
or O
something O
. O

I H
think O
it's O
it O
's H
like O
this O
part N
on O
the O
left O
foot N
because O
my H
foot N
feels O
super O
tight O
in O
only O
the O
left O
side N
, O
so O
something's O
something O
's H
up O
because O
they're O
they O
're O
both O
the O
right O
size N
but O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

So O
I'm O
I H
'm O
gonna O
gon O
na O
exchange N
them O
for O
another O
pair N
because O
something's O
something O
's H
not O
right O
about O
that O
. O

Hey O
guys H
. O

So O
I H
just O
got O
finished O
at O
the O
library N
. O

I H
just O
sat O
in O
there O
for O
like O
an O
hour N
and O
a O
half O
straight O
and O
studied O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
really O
proud O
of O
myself H
and O
now O
I'm O
I H
'm O
about O
to O
go O
get O
some O
lunch N
, O
and O
go O
to O
DSW O
and O
see O
if O
I H
can O
exchange N
those O
Vans O
. O

So O
while O
I H
was O
in O
the O
library N
one O
of O
you H
guys H
came O
up O
to O
me H
, O
and O
said O
hi O
. O

I H
feel O
so O
bad O
because O
I H
was O
so O
in O
the O
zone N
that O
I H
didn't O
did O
n't O
even O
get O
her O
name N
. O

But O
if O
you're O
you H
're O
watching O
this O
, O
hi O
thank O
you H
so O
much O
for O
coming O
and O
saying O
hi O
to O
me H
you H
actually O
made O
my H
whole O
day N
. O

She O
said O
she O
watches O
my H
videos N
and O
loves O
them O
. O

And O
you H
guys H
are O
so O
sweet O
, O
I H
love N
making O
videos N
and O
it's O
it O
's H
so O
nice O
to O
have O
that O
support O
. O

So O
if O
you H
do O
go O
to O
FGCU O
and O
you H
ever O
see O
me H
on O
campus N
, O
like O
feel O
free O
to O
say O
hi O
because O
you'll O
you H
'll O
make O
my H
day N
. O

I H
just O
got O
out H
of O
DSW O
, O
and O
I H
spent O
like O
30 O
minutes N
in O
there O
because O
it O
was O
just O
such O
a O
process N
for O
them O
to O
do O
an O
exchange N
. O

And O
then O
she O
had O
to O
scan N
and O
go O
get O
the O
shoes N
and O
then O
she O
said O
they O
didn't O
did O
n't O
have O
the O
size N
. O

So O
I H
ended O
up O
having O
to O
order N
them O
, O
but O
she O
said O
there O
was O
no O
way N
to O
do O
a O
direct O
exchange N
. O

So O
she O
had O
to O
give O
me H
a O
return O
and O
then O
re-ring O
it O
up O
. O

And O
oh O
my H
gosh O
I H
was O
literally O
in O
there O
for O
like O
25 O
minutes N
all O
to O
just O
do O
a O
simple O
exchange N
for O
the O
exact O
same O
shoe N
. O

But O
it's O
it O
's H
over O
now O
and O
they're O
they O
're O
gonna O
gon O
na O
send O
them O
to O
me H
in O
the O
mail N
. O

Hopefully O
they'll O
they O
'll O
be O
here O
in O
about O
a O
week N
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
just O
kind N
of O
sad O
that O
they O
didn't O
did O
n't O
have O
them O
in O
stock N
, O
so O
now O
I H
have O
to O
wait O
. O

But O
oh O
well O
it's O
it O
's H
over O
with O
now O
, O
we're O
we H
're O
gonna O
gon O
na O
go O
get O
lunch N
. O

Oakland O
as O
a O
city N

the O
amazing O
diversity N

history N

For O
many O
visitors H
, O
the O
first O
place N
they O
are O
likely O
to O
visit O
is O
Downtown O
, O
especially O
if O
they O
are O
in O
town N
on O
business N
, O
or O
simply O
do O
not O
know O
where O
to O
start N
. O

The O
center N

by O

is O
there O
, O
if O
one O
wants O
to O
branch O
out H
. O

And O
it O
is O
as O
simple O
as O
walking O
in O

, O
for O
the O

a O
Beavertail O
cactus A
, O
you H
can O
make O
your H
own O
cuttings N
. O

To O
do O
this O
, O
choose O
pads N
( O
the O
flat O
, O
oval O
- O
shaped O
sections N
that O
make O
up O
a O
cactus A
) O
that O
are O
6 O
months N
old O
or O
older O
and O
cut O
them O
at O
the O
base N
. O

In O
order N
to O
form N
a O
callous O
and O
prevent O
rot N
, O
cure O
the O
cuttings N
by O
sitting O
the O
pad N
upright O
in O
a O
dry O
, O
dark O
place N
for O
10 O
to O
14 O
days N
. O

Plant O
the O
cuttings N
. O

Prepare O
a O
potting O
mix N
that O
is O
equal O
parts N
soil N
and O
rough O
pumice N
or O
sand N
and O
fill O
the O
appropriate O
number N
of O
pots N

it O
. O

Make O
sure O
there O
are O
holes N
in O
the O
center N
of O
the O
base N
of O
each O
pot N
to O
allow O
for O
good O
drainage N
. O

Set N
the O
cuttings N
upright O
in O
the O
potting O
mix N
about O
an O
inch N
( O
2.5 O
cm. N
) O
deep O
. O

If O
you H
plant O
the O
cuttings N
too O
deep O
, O
they O
might O
rot N
. O

Put O
some O
rocks N
around O
the O
pad N
to O
anchor O
it O
in O
place N
. O

Choose O
a O
spot N
for O
your H
Beavertail O
cactus A
cuttings N
. O

If O
you H
live O
in O
an O
area N
with O
strong O
summer N
sun N
, O
position N
the O
cuttings N
so O
that O
the O
broad O
sides N
of O
the O
cuttings N
face N
east O
and O
west O
while O
the O
slim O
sides N
face N
north N
and O
south O
. O

This O
will O
prevent O
the O
cuttings N
from O
burning O
during O
the O
hottest O
part N
of O
the O
day N
. O

Make O
sure O
the O
spot N
is O
sheltered O
from O
any O
cold O
winter N
winds N
. O

Wait O
for O
a O
month N
. O

Do O
not O
water N
the O
cutting N
for O
the O
first O
month N
. O

The O
moisture N
in O
the O
pad N
will O
provide O
enough O
nutrients N
for O
roots N
to O
grow O
. O

Too O
much O
water N
might O
cause O
rot N
. O

After O
1 O
month N
, O
roots N
will O
have O
sprouted O
and O
you H
can O
water N
the O
cutting N
for O
the O
first O
time N
. O

Always O
let O
the O
soil N
dry O
before O
you H
water N
the O
cuttings N
. O

Once O
fully O
rooted O
, O
they O
are O
extremely O
drought N
resistant O
. O

Fertilize O
the O
plants A
. O

During O
the O
spring N
, O
summer N
, O
and O
fall O
, O
the O
Beavertail O
cactus A
grows O
and O
will O
benefit O
from O
a O
balanced O
fertilizer N
. O

Let O
the O
cuttings N
grow O
. O

From O
the O
first O
pad N
, O
many O
more O
will O
form N
. O

The O
second O

third O
pad N
will O
bear O
some O
flowers N

too O
intense O
for O
rodents A

they O
will O
not O
try O
to O
go O

leg N

we H

it O

now O
advancing O

today's O
today N

gonna O
gon O
na O
start N
off O

three O
games N
that O
you H
know O
aren't O
are O
n't O
as O
hard O
as O
the O
last O
couple N
of O
matches O
we've O
we H
've O
had O
, O
and O
then O
on O
uh O
27th O
of O
April O
, O
we H
have O
Manchester O
City N
in O
the O
first O
leg N
of O
the O
semi-finals O
, O
which O
is O
going O
to O
be O
possibly O
one O
of O
the O
hardest O
games N
I'm O
I H
'm O
gonna O
gon O
na O
be O
playing O
because O
Napoli O
has O
given O
me H
our H
game N
and O
Manchester O
City N
I H
know O
the O
way N
they O
play N
, O
they're O
they O
're O
exactly O
like O
Napoli O
. O

So O
we're O
we H
're O
just O
gonna O
gon O
na O
start N
off O
straightaway O
with O
a O
simulated O
match O
against O
Benevento O
. O

We're O
We H
're O
gonna O
gon O
na O
play N
one O
of O
these O
three O
games N
just O
to O
get O
in O
the O
mood N
of O
playing O
games N
this O
episode N
. O

We've O
We H
've O
got O
a O
pretty O
rotated O
lineup N
Jović O
scoring O
, O
van N
de O
Beek O
and O
Ibrahimovic O
coming O
on O
3 O
- O
1 O
victory N
. O

Bakayoko O
getting O
himself O
a O
red O
card N
. O

Now O
I've O
I H
've O
mentioned O
that O
earlier O
in O
the O
Serie O
A O
UVA O
has O
just O
ran O
away O
with O
the O
Scudetto O
89 O
points N
and O
right O
behind O
them O
is O
Napoli O
us H
with O
76 O
. O

The O
Scudetto O
was O
gonna O
gon O
na O
be O
tough O
all O
the O
time N
you've O
you H
've O
as O
just O
way N
too O
strong O
. O

Genoa O
is O
the O
next O
match O
coming O
up O
and O
I'm O
I H
'm O
going O
to O
be O
playing O
this O
match O
because O
it's O
it O
's H
at O
home O
. O

I'd O
I H
'd O
like O
to O
maybe O
play N
some O
of O
our H
Academy O
players H
in O
this O
match O
. O

The O
last O
match O
he O
scored O
Jović O
so O
I'm O
I H
'm O
gonna O
gon O
na O
continue O
hopefully O
his O
form N
in O
this O
game N
. O

He's O
He O
's H
up O
top N
with O
Galano O
. O

Galano O
started O
off O
well O
three O
goals N
and O
then O
just O
hasn't O
has O
n't O
scored O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I H
thought O
he O
was O
gonna O
gon O
na O
be O
such O
a O
good O
future N
star H
but O
he's O
he O
's H
still O
young O
so O
maybe O
he O
can O
get O
himself O
some O
goals N
here O
. O

Paquetá O
and O
almost O
starting O
Paquetá O
over O
Bennacer O
van N
de O
Beek O
, O
Tonali O
. O

We H
have O
Todibo O
, O
Alderweireld O
in O
defense N
and O
obviously O
in O
goal N
we H
have O
Gigio O
. O

Like O
I H
said O
, O
the O
Scudetto O
if O
it O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
gonna O
gon O
na O
be O
this O
season N
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
pushing O
all O
for O
next O
season N
in O
the O
Champions O
League O
. O

I H
think O
we're O
we H
're O
gonna O
gon O
na O
have O
to O
just O
try O
and O
go O
all O
- O
out H
and O
win O
it O
in O
our H
first O
season N
back N
. O

That O
would O
be O
something O
incredibly O
special O
, O
but O
before O
we H
do O
that O
we H
need O
to O
get O
through O
Manchester O
City N
and O
that O
is O
a O
poor O
pass N
by O
Paquetá O
. O

Here's O
Here O
's H
Paquetá O
now O
finding O
Galano O
, O
Galano O
is O
in O
behind O
that O
is O
great O
stuff N
Galano O
and O
maybe O
could O
have O
went O
to O
ground N
opportunity N
for O
him O
good O
pass N
by O
Paquetá O
. O

Sandro O
Tonali O
, O
Luca H
Jović O
, O
he's O
he O
's H
gonna O
gon O
na O
touch O
it O
and O
try O
to O
hit O
it O
. O

I H
didn't O
did O
n't O

we H
made O
it O
to O
the O
semi N
- O
finals N

And O
I H
just O
want O
to O
check N
out H
what O
the O
club N
objective N
was O
for O
the O
Champions O
League O
this O
season N
they O
wanted O
us H
to O
reach N
the O
semi-finals O
they O
thought O
that O
with O
the O
club N
we H
had O
and O
the O
players H
we H
had O
we H
could O
have O
made O
it O
to O
the O
semis N

we H
did O

for O
Kreo O
, O
only O
8 O
eliminations N
but O
30 O
points N
enough O
to O
put O
him O
in O
third O

thus O
far O
. O

One O
thing N
to O
remember O
from O
yesterday N
, O
Nayte O
and O
Saf O
held O
on O
to O
the O
lead N
the O
first O
five O
games N
and O
it O
slipped O
away O
in O
Game N
six O
. O

Bugha O
has O
been O
in O
the O
lead N
for O
all O
five O
games N
. O

He O
has O
never O
lost O
the O
first O
place N
spot N
. O

Will H
he O
suffer O
the O
same O
fate N
or O
can O
he O
close O
it O
out H
right O
here O
to O
remain O
our H
Fortnite O
world N
champ H
? O

Bugha O
by O
the O
way N
he O
is O
from O
Pennsylvania O
16 O
year N
old O
player H
, O
Sentinels O
, O
qualified O
the O
very O
first O
week N
for O
the O
World O
Cup O
. O

So O
he O
just O
got O
his O
first O
part N
- O
time N
job N
to O
try O
to O
start N
earning O
money N
to O
buy O
himself O
a O
car N
. O

But O
instead O
after O
this O
could O
walk O
away O
with O
three O
million O
dollars N
, O
he's O
he O
's H
gonna O
gon O

and O
say O
I H
quit O
, O
can't O
ca O
n't O
wait O
for O
him O
to O

, O
you H

, O
imagine O
he O
wins O
three O
million O
dollars N
here O
, O
his O
parents H
gonna O
gon O
na O
ask O
him O
to O
take O
the O
trash N
out H
and O
he's O
he O
's H
gonna O
gon O
na O
laugh N
. O

Yeah O
right O
. O

Pay O
his O
butler H
to O
do O
that O
, O
I H
guess O
at O
that O
point N
. O

Celce O
currently O
set O
up O
many O
builds N
, O
one O
of O
these O
very O
early O
awkward O
fights N
, O
sees O
those O
as O
well O
. O

You H
look O
at O
those O
what O
he O
has O
, O
common O
infantry N
rifle N
25 O
shots N
and O
a O
drum N
gun N
. O

Jack H
, O
one O
of O
the O
first O
four O
to O
go O
down O
in O
this O
match O
is O
Skite O
, O
who O
was O
in O
the O
old O
place N
already O
, O
already O
gone O
from O
that O
top N
spot N
. O

If O
I H
do O
– O
as O
he O
throws O
them O
down O
, O
can O
you H
see O
all O
the O
players H
surrounded O
outside O
the O
sunny O
side N
of O
the O
map N
? O

Celce O
he O
continues O
to O
bounce O
around O
for O
a O
moment N
, O
any O
AR N
shots N
left O
, O
will O
get O
solved O
at O
the O
end N
, O
right O
? O

Which's O
Which O
's H
good O
, O
anything O
good O
counts N

The O
farming N

Maufin O
and O
Zayt O
outside O
of O
Loot O
Lake O
just O
fighting O

any O
pressure N
from O
Zayt O
, O
doesn't O
does O
n't O
want O
to O
get O
caught O
on O

Interesting O
load O
, O
that O
gold N

That's O
That O

a O
very O
solid O

Pika O
earned O
12 O
of O
his O
total O
points N
in O
just O
the O
last O
match O
and O
I H
think O
that O
says O
a O
lot N
about O
what O
is O
possible O
. O

In O
11th O
place N
when O
we H
rolled O

this O

Pika O

the O
outside O
. O

Does O
in O
fact N
get O
the O
wall N
replace O
, O
are O
you H
kidding O
me H
? O

Used O
the O
shockwave O
to O
get O
down O
the O
wall N
. O

The O
player H
inside O
was O
smacking O
out H
of O
it O
. O

He O
, O
that's O
that O
's H
unbelievable O
. O

He O
called O
the O
bluff O
, O
he O
called O
the O
bluff O
. O

The O
guy H
was O
trying O
to O
break O
the O
wall N
to O
secure O

his O
own O

Pika O
was O
like O
" O
okay O
, O

me H
, O
I'll O
I H
'll O
just O
replace O

a O
very O

assault N
for O
the O
shotgun N
but O
looks O
like O
the O
aggression N
doesn't O
does O
n't O
end N
here O
. O

He O
can O
just O
continue O
to O
play N
these O
box N
fights N
by O
using O
the O
shockwave O
to O
try O
to O
chomp O
down O
this O
opponent H
again O
. O

Said O
it O
once O
, O
it O
surprised O
you H

At O

I H
do O
not O
blame O
him O
for O
being O
aggressive O
here O
, O
knowing O
that O
players H
may O
be O
a O
little O
sparse O
in O
terms N
of O

He's O
He O

Kinstaar O

These O
two O

The O

felt O
that O
insulin N

be O
best O
for O
this O

IT O
was O
many O
and O
many O
a O
year N
ago O
, O
In O
a O
kingdom N
by O
the O
sea N
, O
That O
a O
maiden H
there O
lived O
whom O
you H
may O
know O
By O
the O
name N
of O
ANNABEL O
LEE O
; O

And O
this O
maiden H
she O
lived O
with O
no O
other O
thought O
Than O
to O
love N
and O
be O
loved O
by O
me H
. O

I H
was O
a O
child H
and O
she O
was O
a O
child H
, O
In O
this O
kingdom N
by O
the O
sea N
: O

But O
we H
loved O
with O
a O
love N
that O
was O
more O
than O
love N
— O

I H
and O
my H
ANNABEL O
LEE O
; O

With O
a O
love N
that O
the O
winged O
seraphs A
of O
heaven N
Coveted O
her O
and O
me H
. O

And O
this O
was O
the O
reason N
that O
, O
long O
ago O
, O
In O
this O
kingdom N
by O
the O
sea N
, O
A O
wind N
blew O
out H
of O
a O
cloud N
, O
chilling O
My H
beautiful O
ANNABEL O
LEE O
; O

So O
that O
her O
highborn O
kinsman H
came O
And O
bore O
her O
away O
from O
me H
, O
To O
shut O
her O
up O
in O
a O
sepulchre N
In O
this O
kingdom N
by O
the O
sea N
. O

The O
angels A
, O
not O
half O
so O
happy O
in O
heaven N
, O
Went O
envying O
her O
and O
me H
— O

Yes O
! O
— O
that O
was O
the O
reason N
( O
as O
all O
men H
know O
, O
In O
this O
kingdom N
by O
the O
sea N
) O
That O
the O
wind N
came O
out H
of O
the O
cloud N
by O
night N
, O
Chilling O
and O
killing O
my H
ANNABEL O
LEE O
. O

But O
our H
love N
it O
was O
stronger O
by O
far O
than O
the O
love N
Of O
those O
who O
were O
older O
than O
we H
— O

Of O
many O
far O
wiser O
than O
we H
— O

And O
neither O
the O
angels A
in O
heaven N
above O
, O
Nor O
the O
demons A
down O
under O
the O
sea N
, O
Can O
ever O
dissever O
my H
soul H
from O
the O
soul H
Of O
the O
beautiful O
ANNABEL O
LEE O
: O

For O
the O
moon N
never O
beams N
, O
without O
bringing O
me H
dreams N
Of O
the O
beautiful O
ANNABEL O
LEE O
; O

And O
the O
stars N
never O
rise O
, O
but O
I H
feel O
the O
bright O
eyes N
Of O
the O
beautiful O
ANNABEL O
LEE O
; O

And O
so O
, O
all O
the O
night N

tide N
, O
I H
lie N
down O
by O
the O
side N
Of O
my H
darling H
— O
my H
darling H

life N

my H
bride H
, O
In O
the O
sepulchre N
there O
by O
the O
sea N

In O
her O
tomb N
by O
the O
sounding O

Because O
I H
could O
not O

He O
kindly O
stopped O

me H
— O

The O

just O
Ourselves H

And O
Immortality N

We H
slowly O
drove O

He O
knew O
no O

And O
I H
had O
put O
away O
My H
labor N
and O
my H
leisure N
too O
, O
For O
His O
Civility N

We H
passed O

THE O
RAVEN O
. O

ONCE O
upon O
a O
midnight N
dreary O
, O
while O
I H
pondered O
, O
weak O
and O
weary O
, O
Over O
many O
a O
quaint O
and O
curious O
volume N
of O
forgotten O
lore N
— O

While O
I H
nodded O
, O
nearly O
napping O
, O
suddenly O
there O
came O
a O
tapping N
, O
As O
of O
some O
one O
gently O
rapping O
, O
rapping O
at O
my H
chamber N
door N
. O

" O
'Tis O
'T O
is O
some O
visiter O
, O
" O
I H
muttered O
, O
" O
tapping N
at O
my H
chamber N
door N
— O

Only O
this O
and O
nothing O
more O
. O
" O

Ah O
, O
distinctly O
I H
remember O
it O
was O
in O
the O
bleak O
December O
, O
And O
each O
separate O
dying O
ember N
wrought O
its O
ghost N
upon O
the O
floor N
. O

Eagerly O
I H
wished O
the O
morrow N
; O
— O
vainly O
I H
had O
sought O
to O
borrow O
From O
my H
books N
surcease N
of O
sorrow N
— O
sorrow N
for O
the O
lost O
Lenore O
— O
For O
the O
rare O
and O
radiant O
maiden H
whom O
the O
angels A
name N
Lenore O
— O
Nameless O
here O
for O
evermore O
. O

And O
the O
silken O
sad O
uncertain O
rustling N
of O
each O
purple O
curtain N
Thrilled O
me H
— O
filled O
me H
with O
fantastic O
terrors N
never O
felt O
before O
; O

So O
that O
now O
, O
to O
still O
the O
beating O
of O
my H
heart N
, O
I H
stood O
repeating O

" O
'Tis O
'T O
is O
some O
visiter O
entreating O
entrance N
at O
my H
chamber N
door N
— O

Some O
late O
visiter O
entreating O
entrance N
at O
my H
chamber N
door N
; O

This O
it O
is O
and O
nothing O
more O
. O
" O

Presently O
my H
soul H
grew O
stronger O
; O

hesitating O
then O
no O
longer O
, O
" O
Sir O
, O
" O
said O
I H
, O
" O
or O
Madam H
, O
truly O
your H
forgiveness N
I H
implore O
; O

But O
the O
fact N
is O
I H
was O
napping O
, O
and O
so O
gently O
you H
came O
rapping O
, O
And O
so O
faintly O
you H
came O
tapping N
, O
tapping N
at O
my H
chamber N
door N
, O
That O
I H
scarce O
was O
sure O
I H
heard O
you H
" O
— O

here O
I H
opened O
wide O
the O
door N
; O
— O
— O

Darkness N
there O
and O
nothing O
more O
. O

Deep N
into O
that O
darkness N
peering O
, O
long O
I H
stood O
there O
wondering O
, O
fearing O
, O
Doubting O
, O
dreaming O
dreams N
no O
mortals H
ever O
dared O
to O
dream N
before O
; O

But O
the O
silence N
was O
unbroken O
, O
and O
the O
stillness N
gave O
no O
token N
, O
And O
the O
only O
word N
there O
spoken O
was O
the O
whispered O
word N
, O
" O
Lenore O
? O
" O

This O
I H
whispered O
, O
and O
an O
echo N
murmured O
back N
the O
word N
, O
" O
Lenore O
! O
" O
— O

Merely O
this O
and O
nothing O
more O
. O

Back O
into O
the O
chamber N
turning O
, O
all O
my H
soul H
within O
me H
burning O
, O
Soon O
again O
I H
heard O
a O
tapping N
something O
louder O
than O
before O
. O

" O
Surely O
, O
" O
said O
I H
, O
" O
surely O
that O
is O
something O
at O
my H
window N
lattice N
; O

Let O
me H
see O
, O
then O
, O
what O
thereat O
is O
and O
this O
mystery N
explore O
— O

Let O
my H
heart N
be O
still O
a O
moment N
and O
this O
mystery N
explore O
; O
— O

'Tis O
'T O
is O
the O
wind N
and O
nothing O
more O
. O
" O

Open O
here O
I H
flung O
the O
shutter N
, O
when O
, O
with O
many O
a O
flirt N
and O
flutter N
, O
In O
there O
stepped O
a O
stately O
Raven A
of O
the O
saintly O
days N
of O
yore N
. O

Not O
the O
least O
obeisance N
made O
he O
; O

not O
a O
minute N
stopped O
or O
stayed O
he O
; O

But O
, O
with O
mien N
of O
lord H
or O
lady H
, O
perched O
above O
my H
chamber N
door N
— O
Perched O
upon O
a O
bust N
of O
Pallas O
just O
above O
my H
chamber N
door N
— O

Perched O
, O
and O
sat O
, O
and O
nothing O
more O
. O

Then O
this O
ebony O
bird A
beguiling O
my H
sad O
fancy O
into O
smiling O
, O
By O
the O
grave O
and O
stern O
decorum N
of O
the O
countenance N
it O
wore O
, O
" O
Though O
thy O
crest N
be O
shorn O
and O
shaven O
, O
thou H
, O
" O
I H
said O
, O
" O
art N
sure O
no O
craven O
, O
Ghastly O
grim O
and O
ancient O
Raven A
wandering O
from O
the O
Nightly O
shore N
— O

Tell O
me H
what O
thy O
lordly O
name N
is O
on O
the O
Night's O
Night N
's H
Plutonian O
shore N
! O
" O

Quoth O
the O
Raven A
, O
" O
Nevermore O
. O
" O

Much O
I H
marvelled O
this O
ungainly O
fowl A
to O
hear O
discourse N
so O
plainly O
, O

Though O
its O
answer N
little O
meaning O
— O
little O
relevancy N
bore O
; O

For O
we H
cannot O
can O
not O
help O
agreeing O
that O
no O
living O
human O
being O
Ever O
yet O
was O
blessed O
with O
seeing O
bird A
above O
his O
chamber N
door N
— O
Bird H
or O
beast A
upon O
the O
sculptured O
bust N
above O
his O
chamber N
door N
, O
With O
such O
name N
as O
" O
Nevermore O
. O
" O

But O
the O
Raven A
, O
sitting O
lonely O
on O
that O
placid O
bust N
, O
spoke O
only O
That O
one O
word N
, O
as O
if O
his O
soul H
in O
that O
one O
word N
he O
did O
outpour O
. O

Nothing O
farther O
then O
he O
uttered O
; O

not O
a O
feather N
then O
he O
fluttered O
— O

Till O
I H
scarcely O
more O
than O
muttered O

" O
Other O
friends H
have O
flown O
before O
— O

On O
the O
morrow N
he O
will O
leave O
me H
, O
as O
my H
Hopes N
have O
flown O
before O
. O
" O

Then O
the O
bird A
said O
" O
Nevermore O
. O
" O

Startled O
at O
the O
stillness N
broken O
by O
reply N
so O
aptly O
spoken O
, O
" O
Doubtless O
, O
" O
said O
I H
, O
" O
what O
it O
utters O
is O
its O
only O
stock N
and O
store N

Caught O
from O
some O
unhappy O
master H
whom O
unmerciful O
Disaster O
Followed O
fast O
and O
followed O
faster O
till O
his O
songs N
one O
burden N
bore O
— O

Till O
the O
dirges N
of O
his O
Hope H
that O
melancholy O
burden N
bore O
Of O
' O
Never O
— O
nevermore O
. O
' O
" O

But O
the O
Raven A
still O
beguiling O
all O
my H
sad O
soul H
into O
smiling O
, O
Straight O
I H
wheeled O
a O
cushioned O
seat N
in O
front N
of O
bird A
and O
bust N
and O
door N
; O

Then O
, O
upon O
the O
velvet N
sinking O
, O
I H
betook O
myself H
to O
linking O
Fancy O
unto O
fancy O
, O
thinking O
what O
this O
ominous O
bird A
of O
yore N
— O
What O
this O
grim O
, O
ungainly O
, O
ghastly O
, O
gaunt O
, O
and O
ominous O
bird A
of O
yore N
Meant O
in O
croaking O
" O
Nevermore O
. O
" O

This O
I H
sat O
engaged O
in O
guessing O
, O
but O
no O
syllable N
expressing O
To O
the O
fowl A
whose O
fiery O
eyes N
now O
burned O
into O
my H
bosom's O
bosom N
's H
core N
; O

This O
and O
more O
I H
sat O
divining O
, O
with O
my H
head N
at O
ease N
reclining O
On O
the O

She O

Then O
, O
me H

the O

perfumed O
from O

Let O

Remove O

Suppose O
all O

Then O

Suppose O

Then O

Call O

Consider O

Suppose O

no O

Thus O

H1,3 O

We H

interchange O

Thus O

Suppose O

Including O

we H

Since O

exactly O
one O

the O

y2 O

y4 O

C N

Hence O
, O
y2 O
and O
y4 O
are O
in O
different O

components N

H2,4 O

Then O
we H
can O
switch O

c2 O

c4 O
in O
the O

that O

Now O
x N
is O
no O

so O
we H
can O
color O

This O

∈ O
T N
. O

Then O
x N
⪯ O
z N
also O
because O
x N
∈ O
S N
and O
y N
∈ O
T N
. O

Thus O
⪯ O
is O
transitive O
. O

Antisymmetry O

Let O
x N
⪯ O
y N
and O
y N
⪯ O
x N
. O

If O
x N
, O
y N
∈ O
S N
then O
x N
= O
y N
by O
the O
antisymmetry O
of O
⪯ O
S N
. O

Likewise O
if O
x N
, O
y N
∈ O
T N
. O

If O
x N
∈ O
S N
and O
y N
∈ O
T N
, O
then O
y N
∈ O
S N
and O
x N
∈ O
T N
as O
well O
. O

Thus O
x N
= O
y N
from O
the O
antisymmetry O
of O
⪯ O
S N
or O
⪯ O
T N
. O

Conclude O
that O
⪯ O
is O
a O
total O
ordering N
. O

To O
show O
⪯ O
is O
a O
well O
- O
ordering N
, O
consider O
a O
non-empty O
set O
X N
⊆ O
U N
. O

Then O
either O
: O
X N
∩ O
S N
= O
∅ O
or O
: O
X N
∩ O
T N
= O
∅ O
or O
: O
X N
∩ O
S N
is O
non-empty O
and O
X N
∩ O
T N
is O
non-empty O
. O

In O
the O
first O
case N
, O
X N
⊆ O
T N
, O
by O
Intersection N
with O
Complement N
is O
Empty O
iff O
Subset N
. O

Then O
X N
has O
a O
smallest O
element N
defined O
by O
⪯ O
T N
. O

In O
the O
second O
case N
, O
X N
⊆ O
S N
, O
also O
by O
Intersection N
with O
Complement N
is O
Empty O
iff O
Subset N
. O

Then O
X N
has O
a O
smallest O
element N
defined O
by O
⪯ O
S N
. O

In O
the O
third O
case N
, O
the O
smallest O
element N
of O
X N
∖ O
T N
is O
an O
element N
of O
S N
. O

Thus O
it O
precedes O
any O
element N
of O
T N
by O
the O
definition N
of O
⪯ O
. O

The O
smallest O
element N
of O
X N
∖ O
T N
, O
which O
is O
a O
subset N
of O
S N
, O
is O
guaranteed O
to O
exist O
by O
the O
well O
- O
ordering N
on O
S N
. O

This O
smallest O
element N
is O
then O
also O
the O
smallest O
element N
of O
( O
X N
∖ O
T N
) O
∪ O
T N
= O
X N
. O

Thus O
⪯ O
is O
a O
well O
- O
ordering N
on O
S N
∪ O
T N
. O
□ O

Consider O
the O
mapping N
: O
k N
: O
( O
T N
, O
⪯ O
T N
) O
→ O
( O
U N
, O
⪯ O
) O
: O
k N
( O
α O
) O
= O
α O

Then O
k N
is O
strictly O
increasing O
, O
by O
the O
construction N
of O
⪯ O
. O

Thus O
there O
is O
a O
strictly O
increasing O
mapping N
from O
T N
to O
U N
. O

From O
Strictly O
Increasing O
Mapping N
Between O
Wosets O
Implies O
Order N
Isomorphism N
, O
T N
is O
order N
isomorphic O
to O
U N
or O
an O
initial O
segment N
of O
U N
. O

Let O
Ix N
denote O
the O
initial O
segment N
in O
U N
determined O
by O
x N
, O
according O
to O
k N
. O

Note O
that O
Ix N
= O
Ik O
( O
x N
) O
, O
because O
k N
( O
x N
) O
= O
x N
. O

Suppose O
x N
∈ O
S N
. O

Then O
Ix N
⊆ O
S N
because O
⪯ O
is O
a O
well O
- O
ordering N
. O

Thus O
there O
is O
an O
order N
isomorphism N
from O
T N
to O
Ix N
in O
S N
. O

Suppose O
x N
= O
min N
T N
, O
the O
smallest O
element N
of O
T N
. O

Then O
every O
element N
of O
S N
strictly O
precedes O
x N
, O
as O
x N
is O
in O
T N
. O

Also O
, O
x N
precedes O
every O
element N
of O
T N
, O
so O
Ix N
≠ O
T N
. O

Thus O
there O
is O
an O
order N
isomorphism N
from O
T N
to O
all O
of O
S N
. O

Suppose O
x N
∈ O
T N
and O
x N
≠ O
min N
T N
. O

Then O
Ix N
defines O
an O
initial O
segment N
in O
T N
. O

Also O
, O
every O
element N
of O
S N
strictly O
precedes O
x N
, O
as O
x N
is O
in O
T N
. O

Thus O
there O
is O
an O
order N
isomorphism N
from O
an O

to O
all O

I H
heard O
from O
her O
I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
to O
pleased O
with O
. O

I H
heard O
her O
side N
of O
things N
wich O
are O
real O
different O
from O
what O
you H
had O
to O
say O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
only O
going O
to O
say O
this O
one O
time N
so O
you H
better O
make O
sure O
you H
understand O
. O

If O
you H
ever O
touch O
my H
daughter H
again O
, O
I'll O
I H
'll O
have O
you H

Ashley H

father H
or O

, O
and O
I H

first O
place N
. O

sounded O
a O
little O
shaky O
over O
the O
phone N
and O
gave O
yourself H
away O
. O

I H
told O

a O
long O
time N
ago O

. O

You're O
You H

phone N
calls N
to O
San O
Pedro O
to O
some O
friends H

the O
not O

happy O

your H
fucking O
game N
playing O
with O
other O
people's O
people N
's H
money N
and O
especially O
you H
hitting O
Paula H
. O

What O
I H
want O
done O
and O
it O
better O
be O
done O
. O

Everything O
that's O
that O
's H
mine H
or O
hers O
tools N
, O
clothes N

books N
, O
gun N
, O

I H
don't O

's H
a O
bobby H
pin N

thing N
. O

You H

a O
week N

message N

Your H

1 O
week N

. O

And O
keep O
playing O
your H
game N
with O
Paula H
and O
see O
what O
happens O
. O

Dr. O
Means O
, O

It O
has O
come O
to O
our H
attention N
that O
you H
are O
planning O
to O
do O
abortions N
at O
your H
Harry H
St. O
location N
. O

I H
am O
stunned O
that O
you H
would O
take O
your H
career N
in O
this O
direction N
. O

Fewer O
people N
than O
ever O
before O
are O
pro-abortion O
, O
quality N
physicians H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
even O
consider O
associating O
themselves O
with O
it O
, O
and O
more O
Americans H
than O
ever O
before O
are O
unwilling O
to O
turn N
a O
blind O
eye N
to O
the O
killing O
of O
a O
baby H
when O
the O
ratio N
for O
adoption N
is O
36 O
couples O
to O
1 O
baby H
. O

Maybe O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
realize O
the O
consequences N
of O
killing O
the O
innocent O
. O

If O
Tiller O
could O
speak O
from O
hell N
, O
he O
would O
tell O
you H
what O
a O
soulless O
existence N
you H
are O
purposefully O
considering O
, O
all O
in O
the O
name N
of O
greed N
. O

Thousands N
of O
people N
are O
already O
looking O
into O
your H
background N
, O
not O
just O
in O
Wichita O
, O
but O
from O
all O
over O
the O
U.S. O

They O
will O
know O
your H
habits N
and O
routines N
. O

They O
know O
where O
you H
shop O
, O
who O
your H
friends H
are O
, O
what O
you H
drive O
, O
where O
you H
live O
. O

You H
will O
be O
checking O
under O
your H
car N
every O
day N
— O
because O
maybe O
today N
is O
the O
day N
someone O
places O
an O
explosive N
under O
it O
. O

People N
will O
be O
picketing O
your H
home O
, O
your H
office N
. O

You H
will O
come O
under O
greater O
scrutiny N
than O
you've O
you H
've O
ever O
known O
, O
legally O
and O
professionally O
. O

Much O
worse O
than O
the O
disciplinary O
actions N
and O
ethical O
concerns N
that O
you've O
you H
've O
been O
facing O
. O

You H
will O
become O
a O
pariah H
— O
no O
physician H
will O
want O
to O
associate O
with O
you H
. O

You H
will O
be O
seen O
like O
all O
the O
other O
hacks H
that O
have O
stooped O
to O
doing O
abortions N
when O
they O
weren't O
were O
n't O
good O
enough O
to O
maintain O
a O
real O
practice N
. O

You H
will O
lose O
your H
legitimate O
clientele N
, O
as O
no O
one O
bringing O
a O
baby H
into O
this O
world N
wants O
to O
be O
in O
the O
same O
facility N
where O
you H
are O
also O
killing O
them O
. O

You H
will O
have O
trouble N
keeping O
staff N
who O
are O
willing O
to O
participate O
in O
innocent O
blood N
- O
shedding N
and O
won't O
wo O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
keep O
the O
sanitary O
conditions N
necessary O
to O
maintain O
a O
healthy O
medical O
facility N
. O

You H
will O
end N
up O
having O
the O
same O
kind N
of O
rat A
- O
infested O
, O
dirty O
facility N
that O
they O
have O
in O
north N
- O
eastern O
Kansas O
. O

Anyone O
who O
partners O
with O
you H
will O
experience N
the O
same O
headaches N
. O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
fact N
that O
you H
will O
be O
haunted O
by O
bloody O
, O
squirming O
, O
dismembered O
babies H
in O
your H

. O

You H
can't O
ca O
n't O
do O
what O
is O
morally O
reprehensible O
and O
enjoy O
peace N
of O
mind N
. O

, O
" O
There O
are O
six O
things N

Lord H

I H

can O
to O
stop O
it O

We H
pray O
you H
will O
either O
make O
the O
right O
choice N
and O
use O
your H
medical O
practice N
to O
heal O
instead O
of O
kill O
, O
or O
that O
God H
will O
bring O
judgment N
on O
you H

the O

you H
can O
not O
imagine O

We H
don't O
do O

I H
understand O
you H

you're O

very O

you H
think O
that O
by O

you H
have O
created O
me H
a O
lot N

that O
is O
an O
incorrect O
assessment N

but O
I H
must O
admit O
I H
have O
run O
out H
of O
patience N

you H

your H
smug O
attitude N
. O

I H
hope O
the O
fact N
that O
I've O
I H
've O
obviously O
paid O
someone O

you H
conveys O
the O
seriousness N

which O
I H
take O
your H
current O
attitude N

If O
you H
resolve O
this O
issue N
quickly O
and O
efficiently O
I H
can O
guarantee O
you H
will O
not O
hear O
from O
me H
again O
; O
if O
you H
don't O
do O
n't O
, O
well O
, O
you H
will O
be O
well O
known O
to O
the O
Citibank O

you H
are O
currently O
in O
litigation N
with O
in O
a O
very O
short O
amount N

time N

Again O
, O
make O
my H
life N
easy O

you H

PS O
: O
I H
took O
the O
liberty N

information N
on O
your H
outstanding O
disputed O
credit N

an O

and O
can O
probably O
make O
you H
better O

the O

that O

that O

is O
what O
did O
in O

he O
spoke O

Quinn H

Did O
you H

man H

I H

For O

been O
having O
the O

conversation N

this O
man H

Once O

had O
talked O

now O
, O
each O
time N
Quinn H
came O
in O
, O
they O
continued O
to O
talk O
about O
it O
. O

In O
the O
winter N

the O
talk O
was O
of O
trades N
, O
predictions N
, O
memories N
. O

During O
the O
seasons N
, O
it O
was O
always O
the O
most O
recent O
game N
. O

They O
were O
both O
Mets O
fans H
, O
and O
the O
hopelessness N
of O
that O
passion N
had O
created O
a O
bond N

They O
should O

him O

Yeah O
, O
said O
the O
counterman H

But O
they'll O
they O
'll O
be O
tough O

Better O
than O
last O

anyway O

I H
don't O
do O

said O
Quinn H
, O
taking O
another O
bite N

It O
looks O
good O
on O
paper N
, O
but O
what O
do O
they O
really O
have O
? O

Stearns O
is O
always O
getting O
hurt O
. O

They O
have O
minor O
leaguers O
at O
second O
and O
short O
, O
and O
Brooks H
can't O
ca O
n't O
keep O
his O
mind N
on O
the O
game N

Mookie's O
Mookie O
's H
good O
, O
but O
he's O
he O
's H
raw O
, O
and O
they O
can't O
ca O
n't O
even O
decide O
who O
to O
put O
in O
right O
. O

There's O
There O
's H
still O
Rusty H
, O
of O
course O
, O
but O
he's O
he O
's H
too O
fat N
to O
run O
anymore O
. O

And O
as O
for O
the O
pitching O
, O
forget O
it O
. O

You H
and O
I H
could O
go O
over O
to O
Shea H
tomorrow N
and O
get O
hired O
as O
the O
top N
two O
starters N
. O

Maybe O
I H
make O
you H
the O
manager O
, O
said O
the O
counterman H
. O

You H
could O
tell O
those O
fuckers H
where O
to O
get O
off O
. O

You H
bet O
your H
bottom N
dollar N
, O
said O
Quinn H
. O

After O
he O
finished O
eating O
, O
Quinn H
wandered O
over O
to O
the O
stationery N
shelves N
. O

A O
shipment N
of O
new O
notebooks N
had O
come O
in O
, O
and O
the O
pile N
was O
impressive O
, O
a O
beautiful O
array N
of O
blues O
and O
greens O
and O
reds O
and O
yellows O
. O

He O
picked O
one O
up O
and O
saw O
that O
the O
pages N
had O
the O
narrow O
lines N
he O
preferred O
. O

Quinn H
did O
all O
his O
writing N
with O
a O
pen N
, O
using O
a O
typewriter N
only O
for O
final O
drafts N
, O
and O
he O
was O
always O
on O
the O
lookout H
for O
good O
spiral N
notebooks N
. O

Now O
that O
he O
had O
embarked O
on O
the O
Stillman O
case N
, O
he O
felt O
that O
a O
new O
notebook N
was O
in O
order N
. O

It O
would O
be O
helpful O
to O
have O
a O
separate O
place N
to O
record O
his O
thoughts N
, O
his O
observations N
, O
and O
his O
questions N
. O

In O
that O
way N
, O
perhaps O
, O
things N
might O
not O
get O
out H
of O
control O
. O

He O
looked O
through O
the O
pile N
, O
trying O
to O
decide O
which O
one O
to O
pick O
. O

For O
reasons N
that O
were O
never O
made O
clear O
to O
him O
, O
he O
suddenly O
felt O
an O
irresistible O
urge O
for O
a O
particular O
red O
notebook N
at O
the O
bottom N
. O

He O
pulled O
it O
out H
and O
examined O
it O
, O
gingerly O
fanning O
the O
pages N
with O
his O
thumb N
. O

He O
was O
at O
a O
loss N
to O
explain O
to O
himself O
why O
he O
found O
it O
so O
appealing O
. O

It O
was O
a O
standard O
eight-and-a-half-by-eleven O
notebook N
with O
one O
hundred O
pages N
. O

But O
something O
about O
it O
seemed O
to O
call N
out H
to O
him O
– O
as O
if O
its O
unique O
destiny N
in O
the O
world N
was O
to O
hold O
the O
words N
that O
came O
from O
his O
pen N
. O

Almost O
embarrassed O
by O
the O
intensity N
of O
his O
feelings N
, O
Quinn H
tucked O
the O
red O
notebook N
under O
his O
arm N
, O
walked O
over O
to O
the O
cash N
register N
, O
and O
bought O
it O
. O

He O
made O
it O
to O
Grand O
Central O
well O
in O
advance N
. O

Stillman's O
Stillman O
's H
train N
was O
not O
due O
to O
arrive O
until O
six-forty-one O
, O
but O
Quinn H
wanted O
time N
to O
study N
the O
geography N
of O
the O
place N
, O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
Stillman O
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
slip O
away O
from O
him O
. O

As O
he O
emerged O
from O
the O
subway N
and O
entered O
the O
great O
hall N
, O
he O
saw O
by O
the O
clock N
that O
it O
was O
just O
past N
four O
. O

Already O
the O
station N
had O
begun O
to O
fill O
with O
the O
rush-hour O
crowd N
. O

Making O
his O
way N
through O
the O
press N
of O
oncoming O
bodies N
, O
Quinn H
made O
a O
tour N
of O
the O
numbered O
gates N
, O
looking O
for O
hidden O
staircases N
, O
unmarked O
exits N
, O
dark O
alcoves N
. O

He O
concluded O
that O
a O
man H
determined O
to O
disappear O
could O
do O
so O
without O
much O
trouble N
. O

He O
would O
have O
to O
hope O
that O
Stillman O
had O
not O
been O
warned O
that O
he O
would O
be O
there O
. O

If O
that O
were O
the O
case N
, O
and O
Stillman O
managed O
to O
elude O
him O
, O
it O
would O
mean O
that O
Virginia H
Stillman O
was O
responsible O
. O

There O
was O
no O
one O
else O
. O

It O
solaced O
him O
to O
know O
that O
he O
had O
an O
alternate O
plan N
if O
things N
went O
awry O
. O

If O
Stillman O
did O
not O
show O
up O
, O
Quinn H
would O
go O
straight O
to O
69th O
Street N
and O
confront O
Virginia H
Stillman O
with O
what O
he O
knew O
. O

As O
he O
wandered O
through O
the O
station N
, O
he O
reminded O
himself O
of O
who O
he O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
. O

The O
effect N
of O
being O
Paul H
Auster O
, O
he O
had O
begun O
to O
learn O
, O
was O
not O
altogether O
unpleasant O
. O

Although O
he O
still O
had O
the O
same O
body N
, O
the O
same O
mind N
, O
the O
same O
thoughts N
, O
he O
felt O
as O
though O
he O
had O
somehow O
been O
taken O
out H
of O
himself O
, O
as O
if O
he O
no O
longer O
had O
to O
walk O
around O
with O
the O
burden N
of O
his O
own O
consciousness N
. O

By O
a O
simple O
trick N
of O
the O
intelligence N
, O
a O
deft O
little O
twist N
of O
naming O
, O
he O
felt O
incomparably O
lighter O
and O
freer O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time N
, O
he O
knew O
it O
was O
all O
an O
illusion N
. O

But O
there O
was O
a O
certain O
comfort N
in O
that O
. O

He O
had O
not O
really O
lost O
himself O
; O
he O
was O
merely O
pretending O
, O
and O
he O
could O
return O
to O
being O
Quinn H
whenever O
he O
wished O
. O

The O
fact N
that O
there O
was O
now O
a O
purpose N
to O
his O
being O
Paul H
Auster O
– O
a O
purpose N
that O
was O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
important O
to O
him O
– O
served O
as O
a O
kind N
of O
moral O
justification N
for O
the O
charade N
and O
absolved O
him O
of O
having O
to O
defend O
his O
lie N
. O

For O
imagining O
himself O
as O
Auster O
had O
become O
synonymous O
in O
his O
mind N
with O
doing O
good O
in O
the O
world N
. O

He O
wandered O
through O
the O
station N
, O
then O
, O
as O
if O
inside O
the O
body N
of O
Paul H
Auster O
, O
waiting O
for O
Stillman O
to O
appear O
. O

He O
looked O
up O
at O
the O
vaulted O
ceiling N
of O
the O
great O
hall N
and O
studied O
the O
fresco N
of O
constellations N
. O

There O
were O
light O
bulbs N
representing O
the O
stars N
and O
line N
drawings N
of O
the O
celestial O
figures N
. O

Quinn H
had O
never O
been O
able O
to O
grasp O
the O
connection N
between O
the O
constellations N
and O
their O
names N
. O

As O
a O
boy H
he O
had O
spent O
many O
hours N
under O
the O
night N
sky N
trying O
to O
tally O
the O
clusters N
of O
pinprick N
lights N
with O
the O
shapes N
of O
bears A
, O
bulls H
, O
archers H
, O
and O
water N
carriers N
. O

But O
nothing O
had O
ever O
come O
of O
it O
, O
and O
he O
had O
felt O
stupid O
, O
as O
though O
there O
were O
a O
blind O
spot N
in O
the O
center N
of O
his O
brain N
. O

In O
spite N
of O
everything O
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
Quinn H
not O
to O
feel O
glad O
of O
this O
. O

They O
sat O
there O
for O
a O
short O
time N
without O
saying O
anything O
. O

At O
last O
, O
Auster O
gave O
a O
little O
shrug N
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
they O
had O
come O
to O
an O
impasse N
. O

He O
stood O
up O
and O
said O
, O
I H
was O
about O
to O
make O
some O
lunch N
for O
myself H
. O

It's O
It O
's H
no O
trouble N
making O
it O
for O
two O
. O

Quinn H
hesitated O
. O

It O
was O
as O
though O
Auster O
had O
read O
his O
thoughts N
, O
divining O
the O
thing N
he O
wanted O
most O
– O
to O
eat O
, O
to O
have O
an O
excuse N
to O
stay O
a O
while O
. O

I H
really O
should O
be O
going O
, O
he O
said O
. O

But O
yes O
, O
thank O
you H
. O
A O
little O
food N
can't O
ca O
n't O
do O
any O
harm N
. O

How O
does O
a O
ham N
omelette N
sound O
? O

Sounds O
good O
. O

Auster O
retreated O
to O
the O
kitchen N
to O
prepare O
the O
food N
. O

Quinn H
would O
have O
liked O
to O
offer O
to O
help O
, O
but O
he O
could O
not O
budge O
. O

His O
body N
felt O
like O
a O
stone N
. O

For O
want O
of O
any O
other O
idea N
, O
he O
closed O
his O
eyes N
. O

In O
the O
past N
, O
it O
had O
sometimes O
comforted O
him O
to O
make O
the O
world N
disappear O
. O

This O
time N
, O
however O
, O
Quinn H
found O
nothing O
interesting O
inside O
his O
head N
. O

It O
seemed O
as O
though O
things N
had O
ground N
to O
a O
halt N
in O
there O
. O

Then O
, O
from O
the O
darkness N
, O
he O
began O
to O
hear O
a O
voice N
, O
a O
chanting O
, O
idiotic O
voice N
that O
sang O
the O
same O
sentence N
over O
and O
over O
again O
: O
You H
can't O
ca O
n't O
make O
an O
omelette N
without O
breaking O
eggs A
. O

He O
opened O
his O
eyes N
to O
make O
the O
words N
stop O
. O

There O
was O
bread N
and O
butter N
, O
more O
beer N
, O
knives N
and O
forks N
, O
salt N
and O
pepper A
, O
napkins N
, O
and O
omelettes N
, O
two O
of O
them O
, O
oozing O
on O
white O
plates N
. O

Quinn H
ate O
with O
crude O
intensity N
, O
polishing O
off O
the O
meal N
in O
what O
seemed O
a O
matter N
of O
seconds N
. O

After O
that O
, O
he O
made O
a O
great O
effort N
to O
be O
calm O
. O

Tears N
lurked O
mysteriously O
behind O
his O
eyes N
, O
and O
his O
voice N
seemed O
to O
tremble O
as O
he O
spoke O
, O
but O
somehow O
he O
managed O
to O
hold O
his O
own O
. O

To O
prove O
that O
he O
was O
not O
a O
self-obsessed O
ingrate H
, O
he O
began O
to O
question N
Auster O
about O
his O
writing N
. O

Auster O
was O
somewhat O
reticent O
about O
it O
, O
but O
at O
last O
he O
conceded O
that O
he O
was O
working O
on O
a O
book N
of O
essays N
. O
The O
current O
piece N
was O
about O
Don H
Quixote O
. O

One O
of O
my H
favourite O
books N
, O
said O
Quinn H
. O

Yes O
, O
mine H
too O
. O

There's O
There O
's H
nothing O
like O
it O
. O

Quinn H
asked O
him O
about O
the O
essay N
. O

I H
suppose O
you H
can O
call N
it O
speculative O
, O
since O
I'm O
I H
'm O
not O
really O
out H
to O
prove O
anything O
. O

In O
fact N
, O
it's O
it O
's H
all O
done O
tounge-in-cheek O
. O

An O
imaginative O
reading O
, O
I H
guess O
you H
could O
say O
. O

What's O
What O
's H
the O
gist N
? O

It O
mostly O
has O
to O
do O
with O
the O
authorship N
of O
the O
book N
. O
Who O
wrote O
it O
, O
and O
how O
it O
was O
written O
. O

Is O
there O
any O
question N
? O

Of O
course O
not O
. O
But O
I H
mean O
the O
book N
inside O
the O
book N
Cervantes O
wrote O
, O
the O
one O
he O
imagined O
he O
was O
writing N
. O

Ah O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
quite O
simple O
. O

Cervantes O
, O
if O
you H
remember O
, O
goes O
to O
great O
lengths N
to O
convince O
the O
reader H
that O
he O
is O
not O
the O
author H
. O

The O
book N
, O
he O
says O
, O
was O
written O
in O
Arabic O
by O
Cid O
Hamete O
Benengali O
. O

Cervantes O
describes O
how O
he O
discovered O
the O
manuscript N
by O
chance N
one O
day N
in O
the O
market N
at O
Toledo O
. O

He O
hires O
someone O
to O
translate O
it O
for O
him O
into O
Spanish O
, O

and O
thereafter O
he O
presents O
himself O
as O
no O
more O
than O
the O
editor H
of O
the O
translation O
. O

In O
fact N
, O
he O
can O
not O
even O
vouch O
for O
the O
accuracy N
of O
the O
translation O
itself O
. O

And O
yet O
he O
goes O
on O
to O
say O
, O
Quinn H
added O
, O
that O
Cid O
Hamete O
Benengali's O
Benengali O
's H
is O
the O
only O
true O
version N
of O
Don H
Quixote's O
Quixote O
's H
story N
. O

All O
the O
other O
versions N
are O
frauds N
, O
written O
by O
impostors H
. O

He O
makes O
a O
great O
point N
of O
insisting O
that O
everything O
in O
the O
book N
really O
happened O
in O
the O
world N
. O

Exactly O
. O

Because O
the O
book N
after O
all O
is O
an O
attack N
on O
the O
dangers N
of O
the O
make-believe N
. O

He O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
very O
well O
offer O
a O
work O
of O
the O
imagination N
to O
do O
that O
, O
could O
he O
? O

He O
had O
to O
claim O
that O
it O
was O
real O
. O

Still O
, O
I've O
I H
've O
always O
suspected O
that O
Cervantes O
devoured O
those O
old O
romances N
. O

You H
can't O
ca O
n't O
hate O
something O
so O
violently O
unless O
a O
part N
of O
you H
also O
loves O
it O
. O

In O
some O
sense N
, O
Don H
Quixote O
was O
just O
a O
stand-in H
for O
himself O
. O

I H
agree O
with O
you H
. O

What O
better O
portrait N
of O
a O
writer O
than O
to O
show O
a O
man H
who O
has O
been O
bewitched O
by O
books N
? O

Precisely O
. O

In O
any O
case N
, O
since O
the O
book N
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
real O
, O
it O
follows O
that O
the O
story N
has O
to O
be O
written O
by O
an O
eyewitness H
to O
the O
events N
that O
take O
place N
in O
it O
. O

But O
Cid O
Hamete O
, O
the O
acknowledged O
author H
, O
never O
makes O
an O
appearance N
. O

Not O
once O
does O
he O
claim O
to O
be O
present O
at O
what O
happens O
. O

So O
, O
my H
question N
is O
this O
: O
who O
is O
Cid O
Hamete O
Benengali O
? O

Yes O
, O
I H
see O
what O
you're O
you H
're O
getting O
at O
. O

The O
theory N
I H
present O
in O
the O
essay N
is O
that O
he O
is O
actually O
a O
combination N
of O
four O
different O
people N
. O

Sancho O
Panza O
is O
of O
course O
the O
witness H
. O

There's O
There O
's H
no O
other O
candidate H
– O
since O
he O
is O
the O
only O
one O
who O
accompanies O
Don H
Quixote O
on O
all O
his O
adventures N
. O

But O
Sancho O
can O
neither O
read O
nor O
write O
. O

Therefore O
, O
he O
can O
not O
be O
the O
author H
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand N
, O
we H
know O
that O
Sancho O
has O
a O
great O
gift N
for O
language N
. O

In O
spite N
of O
his O
inane O
malapropisms N
, O
he O
can O
talk O
circles N
around O
everyone O
else O
in O
the O
book N
. O

It O
seems O
perfectly O
possible O
to O
me H
that O
he O
dictated O
the O
story N
to O
someone O
else O
– O
namely O
, O
to O
the O
barber H
and O
the O
priest H
, O
Don H
Quixote's O
Quixote O
's H
good O
friends H
. O

They O
put O
the O
story N
into O
proper O
literary O
form N
– O
in O
Spanish O
– O
and O
then O
turned O
the O
manuscript N
over O
to O
Samson H
Carrasco O
, O
the O
bachelor H
from O
Salamanca O
, O
who O
proceeded O
to O
translate O
it O
into O
Arabic O
. O

Cervantes O
found O
the O
translation O
, O
had O
it O
rendered O
back N
into O
Spanish O
, O
and O
then O
published O
the O
book N
The O
Adventures N
of O
Don H
Quixote O
. O

But O
why O
would O
Sancho O
and O
the O
others O
go O
to O
all O
that O
trouble N
? O

To O
cure O
Don H
Quixote O
of O
his O
madness N
. O

They O
want O
to O
save O
their O
friend H
. O

Remember O
, O
at O
the O
beginning O
they O
burn O
his O
books N
of O
chivalry N
, O
but O
that O
has O
no O
effect N
. O

The O
Knight H
of O
the O
Sad O
Countenance N
does O
not O
give O
up O
his O
obsessions N
. O

Then O
, O
at O
one O
time N
or O
another O
, O
they O
all O
go O
out H
looking O
for O
him O
in O
various O
disguises O
– O
as O
a O
woman H
in O
distress N
, O
as O
the O
Knight H
of O
the O
Mirrors N
, O
as O
the O
Knight H
of O
the O
White H
Moon N
– O
in O
order N
to O
lure O
Don H
Quixote O
back N
home O
. O

Do O
you H
know O
what O
a O
physicist H
is O
? O

Do O
you H
recognize O
the O
name N
of O
Einstein H
? O
" O

" O
Never O
. O

Who O
is O
he O
? O
" O

This O
is O
too O
much O
for O
me H
. O

Silent O
, O
I H
give O
his O
case N
some O
thought O
. O

Busy-minded O
people N
, O
with O
their O
head-culture O
that O
touches O
all O
surfaces N
, O
have O
heard O
of O
Einstein H
. O

But O
do O
they O
know O
what O
they O
have O
heard O
? O

A O
majority N
do O
not O
. O

These O
Hasidim N
choose O
not O
to O
know O
. O

By O
and O
by O
I H
open O
a O
paperback N
and O
try O
to O
lose O
myself H
in O
mere O
politics N
. O

A O
dozen N
Hasidim N
in O
the O
lavatory N
queue N
stare O
down O
at O
us H
. O

We H
land N
and O
spill O
out H
and O
go O
our H
separate O
ways N
. O

At O
the O
baggage N
carousel N
I H
see O
my H
youthful O
Hasid H
again O
and O
we H
take O
a O
final O
look O
at O
each O
other O
. O

In O
me H
he O
sees O
what O
deformities N
the O
modern O
age N
can O
produce O
in O
the O
seed N
of O

as O

Israel O

The O
Archbishop H
is O
, O
to O
use O
an O
old O
word N
, O
a O
portly O
man H

His O
cassock N

dark O

swells O
with O
the O
body N

On O
his O
breast N
two O
ball-point O

clipped O
between O
the O
buttons N

He O
has O
a O
full O

they O

neat O

nimble O

recalls O
a O
great O
Armenian O
musician H

teacher H
( O
his O

named O
Dirian O
Alexanian O
, O
editor H
of O
Bach's O
Bach H
's H
Suites N

and O
the O
most O
intolerant O
perfectionist H

" O
Just O
as O
particular O
about O
music N
as O
other O
people N
are O
about O
seasonings N
. O

Alexanian O
said O
to O
Pablo H
Casals O
after O
a O
performance N
of O
some O
of O
the O
suites N
, O
You H
made O
three O
bad O
mistakes N
. O

Terrible O
. O

Casals O
did O
not O
answer N
. O

He O
knew O
Alexanian O
was O
right O
. O
" O

Pale O
, O
with O
black O
hair N
in O
abundance N
, O
Tatu O
is O
one O
of O
those O
short O
men H
who O
have O
learned O
to O
hold O
their O
ground N
against O
big O
ones O
. O

He O
sits O
with O
the O
ease N
that O
disguises O
this O
sort N
of O
tension N
. O

His O
paper N
is O
not O
friendly O
to O
Israel O
. O

Two O
or O
three O
times N
I H
consider O
whether O
to O
mention O
to O
him O
a O
letter N
I H
sent O
Le O
Monde O
during O
the O
1973 O
war N
about O
the O
position N
being O
taken O
by O
France O
. O

I H
want O
to O
ask O
him O
why O
it O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
printed O
. O

But O
I H
succeed O
in O
suppressing O
this O
a O
triumph N
over O
myself H
. O

Besides O
, O
Tatu O
does O
not O
have O
the O
look O
of O
a O
man H
whose O
life N
is O
easy O
and O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
see O
why O
I H
should O
spoil O
his O
Jerusalem O
dinner N
for O
him O
in O
his O
diary N
it O
would O
probably O
be O
entered O
as O
" O
An O
enchanted O
evening N
in O
Le O
Proche O
Orient O
with O
an O
Armenian O
archbishop H
. O
" O

I H
decide O
to O
let O
him O
enjoy O
his O
dinner N
. O

Seeking O
common O
ground N
with O
my H
wife H
( O
a O
laudable O
desire N
) O
, O
he O
tells O
her O
that O
he O
too O
is O
Rumanian O
by O
origin N
. O

He O
can O
safely O
say O
this O
, O
for O
his O
family N
came O
to O
France O
in O
the O
seventeenth O
century N
. O

What O
is O
all O
important O
is O
to O
be O
French N
, O
or O
to O
have O
been O
French N
for O
a O
good O
long O
time N
. O

And O
French N
he O
definitely O
is O
. O

But O
I H
can O
see O
that O
the O
Archbishop H
gives O
him O
bad O
marks N
for O
lighting O
up O
after O
the O
main O
course O
. O

People N
of O
real O
culture N
do O
not O
smoke N
at O
dinner N
tables N
. O

You H
never O
know O
whom O
you H
have O
asked O
to O
your H
palace N
. O

Dostoevski O
, O
no O
mean O
judge O
of O
such O
matters N
, O
thought O
there O
was O
much O
to O
be O
said O
for O
the O
murderer's O
murderer H
's H
point N
of O
view N
. O

Navrozov O
extends O
the O
position N
. O

Liberal O
democracy N
is O
as O
brief O
as O
a O
bubble N
. O

Now-and-then O
history N
treats O
us H
to O
an O
interval N
of O
freedom N
and O
civilization N
and O
we H
make O
much O
of O
it O
. O

We H
forget O
, O
he O
seems O
to O
think O
, O
that O
as O
a O
species A
we H
are O
generally O
close O
to O
the O
" O
state N
of O
nature N
, O
" O
as O
Thomas H
Hobbes O
described O
it O
a O
nasty O
, O
brutish O
, O
pitiless O
condition N
in O
which O
men H
are O
too O
fearful O
of O
death N
to O
give O
much O
thought O
to O
freedom N
. O

If O
Hobbes O
is O
too O
nifty O
an O
authority N
, O
let O
us H
think O
of O
the O
social O
views N
of O
Jimmy H
Hoffa O
. O

Or O
of O
the O
Godfather H
. O

Or O
of O
Lenin H
, O
as O
Navrozov O
accurately O
characterizes O
him O
. O

And O
this O
is O
what O
America O
, O
bubbling O
with O
political O
illusions N
, O
is O
up O
against O
. O

So O
, O
at O
least O
, O
Navrozov O
thinks O
. O

Perhaps O
Alexander H
Solzhenitsyn O
agrees O
with O
him O
in O
part N
. O

Apparently O
Russians H
are O
all O
inclined O
to O
see O
us H
in O
this O
way N
. O

My H
own O

no O

ate O
frozen O

undeveloped O

helpless O
: O
all O
that O
Dostoevski O

to O
his O

Nevertheless O
, O
I H
see O
that O
in O
a O

two O
Americans H
who O
think O
themselves O
anything O

Herman H
Kahn H

Bruce-Briggs O

" O
Most O
striking O
is O
the O
disappointing O
performance N
of O
Soviet O
foreign O
and O
domestic O
policy N
since O
the O
late O
1950s O
, O
" O

In O
the O
foreign O
policy N

the O
Soviets N

had O
an O
almost O
uninterrupted O
series N

defeats N

failed O

For O

been O
supporting O
the O
Arabs H
against O
Israel O
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
and O
all O
they O
have O
to O
show O
for O
it O

the O
humiliation N

their O
proteges H
and O
the O
capture N

their O
equipment N

shown O
no O
inclination N

their O

One O
of O
the O
finest O
Israeli O
writers H
, O
A H
B H
Yehoshua O
, O
speaks O
about O
this O
in O
an O
excellent O
book N
of O
interviews N
, O
Unease N
in O
zion O
, O
edited O
by O
Ehud O
ben O
Ezer O
. O

" O
It O
is O
true O
, O
" O
Yehoshua O
writes O
, O
" O
that O
because O
our H
spiritual O
life N
today N
can O
not O
revolve O
around O
anything O
but O
these O
questions N
[ O
political O
questions N
] O
, O
when O
you H
engage O
in O
them O
without O
end N
you H
can O
not O
spare O
yourself H
, O
spiritually O
, O
for O
other O
things N
. O

Nor O
can O
you H
attain O
the O
true O
solitude N
that O
is O
a O
condition N
and O
prerequisite N
of O
creation N
, O
the O
source N
and O
its O
strength N
. O

Rather O
, O
you H
are O
continuously O
summoned O
to O
solidarity N
, O
summoned O
from O
within O
yourself H
rather O
than O
by O
any O
external O
compulsion N
, O
because O
you H
live O
from O
one O
newscast N
to O
the O
next O
, O
and O
it O
becomes O
a O
solidarity N
that O
is O
technical O
, O
automatic O
from O
the O
standpoint N
of O
its O
emotional O
reaction N
, O
because O
by O
now O
you H
are O
completely O
built O
to O
react O
that O
way N
and O
to O
live O
in O
tension N

Your H
emotional O
reactions N
to O
any O
piece N
of O
news N
about O
an O
Israeli O
casualty H
, O
a O
plane N
shot O
down O
, O
are O
pre-determined O
. O

Hence O
the O
lack N
of O
solitude N
, O
the O
inability N
to O
be O
alone O
in O
the O
spiritual O
sense N

and O
to O
arrive O
at O
a O
life N
of O
intellectual O
creativity N

During O
the O
Six O
Day N
War N
, O
Yehoshua O
says O
that O
he O
felt O
himself O
linked O
to O
a O
great O
event N
, O
that O
he O
was O
within O
a O
historic O
wave N
and O
at O
one O
with O
its O
flow N

This O
was O
a O
pleasant O
and O
elevating O
feeling N
. O

But O
today N
, O
unable O
to O
see O
the O
end N
of O
war N
, O
he O
has O
lost O
the O
sensation N
of O
being O
borne O
upon O
any O
such O
wave N
. O

" O
You H
do O
not O
achieve O
peace N
from O
history N

" O
he O
says O
. O

The O
feeling N
of O
being O
swept O
along O
and O
of O
uncertainty N
as O
regards O
the O
future N
prevents O
you H
from O
seeing O
things N
in O
any O
perspective N
whatsoever O
. O

You H
live O
the O
moment N

without O
any O
perspective N
, O
but O
you H
can O
not O
break O
free O
of O
the O
moment N
, O

the O
moment N

You H
can O
not O
cut O
yourself H
off O

not O
read O
newspapers N

stop O
hearing O
the O
news N
over O

weeks N

as O
you H
could O
six O
or O
seven O
years N

" O

It O
is O
slightly O
different O
with O
us H

Our H
media N
make O
crisis N
chatter N
out H
of O
news N

fill O
our H
minds N

anxious O
phantoms N

being O
politicized O
( O
to O
use O
a O
word N

I H
am O
sorry O
to O
own O
I H
began O
to O
worry O
them O
. O

This O
was O
already O
a O
fresh O
departure N
for O
me H
. O

I H
was O
not O
used O
to O
get O
things N
that O
way N
, O
you H
know O
. O

I H
always O
went O
my H
own O
road N
and O
on O
my H
own O
legs N
where O
I H
had O
a O
mind N
to O
go O
. O

I H
wouldn't O
would O
n't O
have O
believed O
it O
of O
myself H
; O
but O
, O
then O
– O
you H
see O
– O
I H
felt O
somehow O
I H
must O
get O
there O
by O
hook N
or O
by O
crook H
. O

So O
I H
worried O
them O
. O

The O
men H
said O
' O
My H
dear O
fellow H
' O
and O
did O
nothing O
. O

Then O
– O
would O
you H
believe O
it O
? O
– O
I H
tried O
the O
women H
. O

I H
, O
Charlie H
Marlow O
, O
set O
the O
women H
to O
work O
– O
to O
get O
a O
job N
. O
Heavens O
! O

Well O
, O
you H
see O
, O
the O
notion N
drove O
me H
. O

I H
had O
an O
aunt H
, O
a O
dear O
enthusiastic O
soul H
. O
She O
wrote O
: O
' O
It O
will O
be O
delightful O
. O
I H
am O
ready O
to O
do O
anything O
, O
anything O
for O
you H
. O

It O
is O
a O
glorious O
idea N
. O
I H
know O
the O
wife H
of O
a O
very O
high O
personage H
in O
the O
Administration N
, O
and O
also O
a O
man H
who O
has O
lots N
of O
influence N
with O
, O
&c. O
, O
&c O
. O

She O
was O
determined O
to O
make O
no O
end N
of O
fuss N
to O
get O
me H
appointed O
skipper H
of O
a O
river N
steamboat N
, O
if O
such O
was O
my H
fancy O
. O

I H
got O
my H
appointment N
– O
of O
course O
; O
and O
I H
got O
it O
very O
quick O
. O

It O
appears O
the O
Company N
had O
received O
news N
that O
one O
of O
their O
captains H
had O
been O
killed O
in O
a O
scuffle N
with O
the O
natives H
. O

This O
was O
my H
chance N
, O
and O
it O
made O
me H
the O
more O
anxious O
to O
go O
. O

It O
was O
only O
months N
and O
months N
afterwards O
, O
when O
I H
made O
the O
attempt N
to O
recover O
what O
was O
left O
of O
the O
body N
, O
that O
I H
heard O
the O
original O
quarrel N
arose O
from O
a O
misunderstanding N
about O
some O
hens A
. O

Yes O
, O
two O
black O
hens A
. O

Fresleven O
– O
that O
was O
the O
fellow's O
fellow H
's H
name N
, O
a O
Dane H
– O
thought O
himself O
wronged O
somehow O
in O
the O
bargain N
, O
so O
he O
went O
ashore O
and O
started O
to O
hammer O
the O
chief O
of O
the O
village N
with O
a O
stick O
. O

Oh O
, O
it O
didn't O
did O
n't O
surprise N
me H
in O
the O
least O
to O
hear O
this O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time N
to O
be O
told O
that O
Fresleven O
was O
the O
gentlest O
, O
quietest O
creature A
that O
ever O
walked O
on O
two O
legs N
. O

No O
doubt N
he O
was O
; O
but O
he O
had O
been O
a O
couple N
of O
years N
already O
out H
there O
engaged O
in O
the O
noble O
cause O
, O
you H
know O
, O
and O
he O
probably O
felt O
the O
need O
at O
last O
of O
asserting O
his O
self-respect N
in O
some O
way N
. O

Therefore O
he O
whacked O
the O
old O
nigger H
mercilessly O
, O
while O
a O
big O
crowd N
of O
his O
people N
watched O
him O
, O
thunderstruck O
, O
till O
some O
man H
, O
– O
I H
was O
told O
the O
chief's O
chief O
's H
son H
, O
– O
in O
desperation N
at O
hearing O
the O
old O
chap H
yell O
, O
made O
a O
tentative O
jab N
with O
a O
spear N
at O
the O
white O
man H
– O
and O
of O
course O
it O
went O
quite O
easy O
between O
the O
shoulder-blades O
. O

Then O
the O
whole O
population N
cleared O
into O
the O
forest N
, O
expecting O
all O
kinds N
of O
calamities N
to O
happen O
, O
while O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand N
, O
the O
steamer N
Fresleven O
commanded O
left O
also O
in O
a O
bad O
panic N
, O
in O
charge N
of O
the O
engineer H
, O
I H
believe O
. O

Afterwards O
nobody O
seemed O
to O
trouble N
much O
about O
Fresleven's O
Fresleven O
's H
remains O
, O
till O
I H
got O
out H
and O
stepped O
into O
his O
shoes N
. O

I H
couldn't O
could O
n't O
let O
it O
rest N
, O
though O
; O
but O
when O
an O
opportunity N
offered O
at O
last O
to O
meet O
my H
predecessor H
, O
the O
grass A
growing O
through O
his O
ribs N
was O
tall O
enough O
to O
hide O
his O
bones N
. O

They O
were O
all O
there O
. O

The O
supernatural O
being O
had O
not O
been O
touched O
after O
he O
fell O
. O

And O
the O
village N
was O
deserted O
, O
the O
huts N
gaped O
black O
, O
rotting O
, O
all O
askew O
within O
the O
fallen O
enclosures N
. O

A H
calamity N
had O
come O
to O
it O
, O
sure O
enough O
. O
The O
people N
had O
vanished O
. O

Mad O
terror N
had O
scattered O
them O
, O
men H
, O
women H
, O
and O
children H
, O
through O
the O
bush A
, O
and O
they O
had O
never O
returned O
. O

What O
became O
of O
the O
hens A
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
either O
. O

I H
should O
think O
the O
cause O
of O
progress N
got O
them O
, O
anyhow O
. O

However O
, O
through O
this O
glorious O
affair N
I H
got O
my H
appointment N
, O
before O
I H
had O
fairly O
begun O
to O
hope O
for O
it O
. O

I H
flew O
around O
like O
mad O
to O
get O
ready O
, O
and O
before O
forty-eight O
hours N
I H
was O
crossing O
the O
Channel N
to O
show O
myself H
to O
my H
employers H
, O
and O
sign O
the O
contract N
. O

In O
a O
very O
few O
hours N
I H
arrived O
in O
a O
city N
that O
always O
makes O
me H
think O
of O
a O
whited O
sepulcher N
. O

Prejudice N
no O
doubt N
. O

I H
had O
no O
difficulty N
in O
finding O
the O
Company's O
Company N
's H
offices N
. O

It O
was O
the O
biggest O
thing N
in O
the O
town N
, O
and O
everybody O
I H
met O
was O
full O
of O
it O
. O

They O
were O
going O
to O
run O
an O
over-sea O
empire N
, O
and O
make O
no O
end N
of O
coin N
by O
trade N
. O

A H
narrow O
and O
deserted O
street N
in O
deep O
shadow N
, O
high O
houses N
, O
innumerable O
windows N
with O
venetian O
blinds N
, O
a O
dead O
silence N
, O
grass A
sprouting O
between O
the O
stones N
, O
imposing O
carriage N
archways N
right O
and O
left O
, O
immense O
double O
doors N
standing O
ponderously O
ajar O
. O

I H
slipped O
through O
one O
of O
these O
cracks N
, O
went O
up O
a O
swept O
and O
ungarnished O
staircase N
, O
as O
arid O
as O
a O
desert N
, O
and O
opened O
the O
first O
door N
I H
came O
to O
. O

Two O
women H
, O
one O
fat N
and O
the O
other O
slim O
, O
sat O
on O
straw-bottomed O
chairs O
, O
knitting O
black O
wool N
. O

The O
slim O
one O
got O
up O
and O
walked O
straight O
at O
me H
– O
still O
knitting O
with O
downcast O
eyes N
– O
and O
only O
just O
as O
I H
began O
to O
think O
of O
getting O
out H
of O
her O
way N
, O
as O
you H
would O
for O
a O
somnambulist H
, O
stood O
still O
, O
and O
looked O
up O
. O
Her O
dress N
was O
as O
plain O
as O
an O
umbrella-cover O
, O
and O
she O
turned O
round O
without O
a O
word N
and O
preceded O
me H
into O
a O
waiting-room O
. O

I H
gave O
my H
name N
, O
and O
looked O
about O
. O

Deal O
table N
in O
the O
middle N
, O
plain O
chairs O
all O
round O
the O
walls N
, O
on O
one O
end N
a O
large O
shining O
map N
, O
marked O
with O
all O
the O
colors N
of O
a O
rainbow N
. O

There O
was O
a O
vast O
amount N
of O
red O
– O
good O
to O
see O
at O
any O
time N
, O
because O
one O
knows O
that O
some O
real O
work O
is O
done O
in O
there O
, O
a O
deuce N
of O
a O
lot N
of O
blue O
, O
a O
little O
green O
, O
smears N
of O
orange N
, O
and O
, O
on O
the O
East O
Coast N
, O
a O
purple O
patch N
, O
to O
show O
where O
the O
jolly O
pioneers H
of O
progress N
drink N
the O
jolly O
lager-beer O
. O

However O
, O
I H
wasn't O
was O
n't O
going O
into O
any O
of O
these O
. O

I H
was O
going O
into O
the O
yellow O
. O
Dead O
in O
the O
center N
. O

And O
the O
river N
was O
there O
– O
fascinating O
– O
deadly O
– O
like O
a O
snake A
. O
Ough O
! O

A H
door N
opened O
, O
a O
white-haired O
secretarial O
head N
, O
but O
wearing O
a O
compassionate O
expression N
, O
appeared O
, O
and O
a O
skinny O
forefinger N
beckoned O
me H
into O
the O
sanctuary N
. O

Its O
light O
was O
dim O
, O
and O
a O
heavy O
writing-desk O
squatted O
in O
the O
middle N
. O

From O
behind O
that O
structure N
came O
out H
an O
impression N
of O
pale O
plumpness N
in O
a O
frock-coat O
. O
The O
great O
man H
himself O
. O

He O
was O
five O
feet N
six O
, O
I H
should O
judge O
, O
and O
had O
his O
grip N
on O
the O
handle-end O
of O
ever O
so O
many O
millions N
. O

He O
shook O
hands N
, O
I H
fancy O
, O
murmured O
vaguely O
, O
was O
satisfied O
with O
my H
French N
. O

Bon O
voyage N
. O

In O
about O
forty-five N
seconds N
I H
found O
myself H
again O
in O
the O
waiting-room O
with O
the O
compassionate O
secretary H
, O
who O
, O
full O
of O
desolation N
and O
sympathy N
, O
made O
me H
sign O
some O
document N
. O

I H
believe O
I H
undertook O
amongst O
other O
things N
not O
to O
disclose O
any O
trade N
secrets N
. O

Well O
, O
I H
am O
not O
going O
to O
. O

I H
began O
to O
feel O
slightly O
uneasy O
. O

You H
know O
I H
am O
not O
used O
to O
such O
ceremonies N
, O
and O
there O
was O
something O
ominous O
in O
the O
atmosphere N
. O

It O
was O
just O
as O
though O
I H
had O
been O
let O
into O
some O
conspiracy N
– O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
– O
something O
not O
quite O
right O
; O
and O
I H
was O
glad O
to O
get O
out H
. O

In O
the O
outer O
room N
the O
two O
women H
knitted O
black O
wool N
feverishly O
. O

A H
caravan N
had O
come O
in O
. O

A H
violent O
babble N
of O
uncouth O
sounds N
burst O
out H
on O
the O
other O
side N
of O
the O
planks N
. O

All O
the O
carriers N
were O
speaking O
together O
, O
and O
in O
the O
midst N
of O
the O
uproar N
the O
lamentable O
voice N
of O
the O
chief O
agent H
was O
heard O
' O
giving O
it O
up O
' O
tearfully O
for O
the O
twentieth O
time N
that O
day N
... O

He O
rose O
slowly O
. O

' O
What O
a O
frightful O
row N
, O
' O
he O
said O
. O

He O
crossed O
the O
room N
gently O
to O
look O
at O
the O
sick O
man H
, O
and O
returning O
, O
said O
to O
me H
, O
' O
He O
does O
not O
hear O
. O
' O

' O
What O
! O
Dead O
? O
' O
I H
asked O
, O
startled O
. O

' O
No O
, O
not O
yet O
, O
' O
he O
answered O
, O
with O
great O
composure N
. O

Then O
, O
alluding O
with O
a O
toss N
of O
the O
head N
to O
the O
tumult N
in O
the O
station-yard O
, O
' O
When O
one O
has O
got O
to O
make O
correct O
entries N
, O
one O
comes O
to O
hate O
those O
savages H
– O
hate O
them O
to O
the O
death N
. O
' O

He O
remained O
thoughtful O
for O
a O
moment N
. O

' O
When O
you H
see O
Mr. N
Kurtz O
, O
he O
went O
on O
, O
tell O
him O
from O
me H
that O
everything O
here O
– O
he O
glanced O
at O
the O
desk N
– O
is O
very O
satisfactory O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
like O
to O
write O
to O
him O
– O
with O
those O
messengers H
of O
ours O
you H
never O
know O
who O
may O
get O
hold O
of O
your H
letter N
– O
at O
that O
Central O
Station N
. O

He O
stared O
at O
me H
for O
a O
moment N
with O
his O
mild O
, O
bulging O
eyes N
. O

' O
Oh O
, O
he O
will O
go O
far O
, O
very O
far O
, O
' O
he O
began O
again O
. O

' O
He O
will O
be O
a O
somebody O
in O
the O
Administration N
before O
long O
. O

They O
, O
above O
– O
the O
Council N
in O
Europe O
, O
you H
know O
– O
mean O
him O
to O
be O
. O

He O
turned O
to O
his O
work O
. O

The O
noise N
outside O
had O
ceased O
, O
and O
presently O
in O
going O
out H
I H
stopped O
at O
the O
door N
. O

In O
the O
steady O
buzz N
of O
flies A
the O
homeward-bound O
agent H
was O
lying O
flushed O
and O
insensible O
; O
the O
other O
, O
bent O
over O
his O
books N
, O
was O
making O
correct O
entries N
of O
perfectly O
correct O
transactions N
; O
and O
fifty O
feet N
below O
the O
doorstep N
I H
could O
see O
the O
still O
tree-tops O
of O
the O
grove N
of O
death N
. O

Next O
day N
I H
left O
that O
station N
at O
last O
, O
with O
a O
caravan N
of O
sixty O
men H
, O
for O
a O
two-hundred-mile O
tramp H
. O

No O
use O
telling O
you H
much O
about O
that O
. O

Paths N
, O
paths N
, O
everywhere O
; O
a O
stamped-in O
network N
of O
paths N
spreading O
over O
the O
empty O
land N
, O
through O
long O
grass A
, O
through O
burnt O
grass A
, O
through O
thickets N
, O
down O
and O
up O
chilly O
ravines N
, O
up O
and O
down O
stony O
hills N
ablaze O
with O
heat N
; O
and O
a O
solitude N
, O
a O
solitude N
, O
nobody O
, O
not O
a O
hut N
. O

The O
population N
had O
cleared O
out H
a O
long O
time N
ago O
. O

Well O
, O
if O
a O
lot N
of O
mysterious O
niggers H
armed O
with O
all O
kinds N
of O
fearful O
weapons N
suddenly O
took O
to O
traveling O
on O
the O
road N
between O
Deal O
and O
Gravesend O
, O
catching O
the O
yokels H
right O
and O
left O
to O
carry O
heavy O
loads N
for O
them O
, O
I H
fancy O
every O
farm N
and O
cottage N
thereabouts O
would O
get O
empty O
very O
soon O
. O

Only O
here O
the O
dwellings N
were O
gone O
too O
. O

Still O
I H
passed O
through O
several O
abandoned O
villages N
. O

There's O
There O
's H
something O
pathetically O
childish O
in O
the O
ruins N
of O
grass A
walls N
. O

Day N
after O
day N
, O
with O
the O
stamp N
and O
shuffle N
of O
sixty O
pair N
of O
bare O
feet N
behind O
me H
, O
each O
pair N
under O
a O
60-lb. N
load O
. O

Camp O
, O
cook H
, O
sleep O
, O
strike O
camp O
, O
march O
. O

Now O
and O
then O
a O
carrier N
dead O
in O
harness N
, O
at O
rest N
in O
the O
long O
grass A
near O
the O
path N
, O
with O
an O
empty O
water-gourd O
and O
his O
long O
staff N
lying O
by O
his O
side N
. O

A H
great O
silence N
around O
and O
above O
. O

Perhaps O
on O
some O
quiet O
night N
the O
tremor N
of O
far-off O
drums N
, O
sinking O
, O
swelling O
, O
a O
tremor N
vast O
, O
faint O
; O
a O
sound O
weird O
, O
appealing O
, O
suggestive O
, O
and O
wild O
– O
and O
perhaps O
with O
as O
profound O
a O
meaning O
as O
the O
sound O
of O
bells N
in O
a O
Christian H
country N
. O

Once O
a O
white O
man H
in O
an O
unbuttoned O
uniform N
, O
camping O
on O
the O
path N
with O
an O
armed O
escort H
of O
lank O
Zanzibaris O
, O
very O
hospitable O
and O
festive O
– O
not O
to O
say O
drunk O
. O

Was O
looking O
after O
the O
upkeep N
of O
the O
road N
, O
he O
declared O
. O

Can't O
Ca O
n't O
say O
I H
saw O
any O
road N
or O
any O
upkeep N
, O
unless O
the O
body N
of O
a O
middle-aged O
negro H
, O
with O
a O
bullet-hole O
in O
the O
forehead N
, O
upon O
which O
I H
absolutely O
stumbled O
three O
miles N
farther O
on O
, O
may O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
permanent O
improvement N
. O

I H
had O
a O
white O
companion H
too O
, O
not O
a O
bad O
chap H
, O
but O
rather O
too O
fleshy O
and O
with O
the O
exasperating O
habit N
of O
fainting O
on O
the O
hot O
hillsides N
, O
miles N
away O
from O
the O
least O
bit N
of O
shade N
and O
water N
. O

Annoying O
, O
you H
know O
, O
to O
hold O
your H
own O
coat N
like O
a O
parasol N
over O
a O
man's O
man H
's H
head N
while O
he O
is O
coming-to O
. O

I H
couldn't O
could O
n't O
help O
asking O
him O
once O
what O
he O
meant O
by O
coming O
there O
at O
all O
. O

' O
To O
make O
money N
, O
of O
course O
. O
' O

What O
do O
you H
think O
? O
he O
said O
, O
scornfully O
. O

Then O
he O
got O
fever N
, O
and O
had O
to O
be O
carried O
in O
a O
hammock N
slung O
under O
a O
pole N
. O

As O
he O
weighed O
sixteen O
stone N
I H
had O
no O
end N
of O
rows N
with O
the O
carriers N
. O

They O
jibbed O
, O
ran O
away O
, O
sneaked O
off O
with O
their O
loads N
in O
the O
night N
– O
quite O
a O
mutiny N
. O

So O
, O
one O
evening N
, O
I H
made O
a O
speech N
in O
English N
with O
gestures N
, O
not O
one O
of O
which O
was O
lost O
to O
the O
sixty O
pairs N
of O
eyes N
before O
me H
, O
and O
the O
next O
morning N
I H
started O
the O
hammock N
off O
in O
front N
all O
right O
. O

An O
hour N
afterwards O
I H
came O
upon O
the O
whole O
concern N
wrecked O
in O
a O
bush A
– O
man H
, O
hammock N
, O
groans N
, O
blankets N
, O
horrors N
. O

The O
heavy O
pole N
had O
skinned O
his O
poor O
nose N
. O

He O
was O
very O
anxious O
for O
me H
to O
kill O
somebody O
, O
but O
there O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
the O
shadow N
of O
a O
carrier N
near O
. O

I H
remembered O
the O
old O
doctor H
, O
– O
' O
It O
would O
be O
interesting O
for O
science N
to O
watch O
the O
mental O
changes N
of O
individuals H
, O
on O
the O
spot N
. O

I H
felt O
I H
was O
becoming O
scientifically O
interesting O
. O

However O
, O
all O
that O
is O
to O
no O
purpose N
. O

On O
the O
fifteenth O
day N
I H
came O
in O
sight N
of O
the O
big O
river N
again O
, O
and O
hobbled O
into O
the O
Central O
Station N
. O

It O
was O
on O
a O
back N
water N
surrounded O
by O
scrub N
and O
forest N
, O
with O
a O
pretty O
border N
of O
smelly O
mud N
on O
one O
side N
, O
and O
on O
the O
three O
others O
inclosed O
by O
a O
crazy O
fence N
of O
rushes A
. O
A H
neglected O
gap N
was O
all O
the O
gate N
it O
had O
, O

and O
the O
first O
glance N
at O
the O
place N
was O
enough O
to O
let O
you H
see O
the O
flabby O
devil N
was O
running O
that O
show O
. O

White H
men H
with O
long O
staves N
in O
their O
hands N
appeared O
languidly O
from O
amongst O
the O
buildings N
, O
strolling O
up O
to O
take O
a O
look O
at O
me H
, O
and O
then O
retired O
out H
of O
sight N
somewhere O
. O

One O
of O
them O
, O
a O
stout O
, O
excitable O
chap H
with O
black O
mustaches N
, O
informed O
me H
with O
great O
volubility N
and O
many O
digressions N
, O
as O
soon O
as O
I H
told O
him O
who O
I H
was O
, O
that O
my H
steamer N
was O
at O
the O
bottom N
of O
the O
river N
. O

I H
was O
thunderstruck O
. O

What O
, O
how O
, O
why O
? O

Oh O
, O
it O
was O
all O
right O
. O

The O
manager O
himself O
was O
there O
. O

All O
quite O
correct O
. O

' O
Everybody O
had O
behaved O
splendidly O
! O
splendidly O
! O

– O
' O
you H
must O
, O
' O
he O
said O
in O
agitation N
, O
' O
go O
and O
see O
the O
general O
manager O
at O
once O
. O

The O
proposal N
put O
forward O
by O
the O
Commission N
is O
to O
be O
welcomed O
from O
the O
consumers H
' O
point N
of O
view N
. O

Affected O
parties N
have O
also O
criticized O
the O
fact N
that O
the O
manufacturer's O
manufacturer N
's H
public O
declarations N
are O
also O
included O
in O
the O
defect N
definition N
. O

Ultimately O
that O
would O
be O
a O
disadvantage N
for O
the O
consumer H
. O

They O
were O
voted O
down O
and O
the O
reasons N
will O
no O
doubt N
be O
put O
once O
again O
by O
Mrs N
Bonino O
. O

One O
is O
the O
question N
of O
second-hand O
goods N
. O

I H
believe O
that O
with O
this O
hierarchy N
we H
have O
solved O
many O
of O
the O
problems N
for O
small O
and O
medium N
enterprises N
. O

At O
the O
same O
time N
it O
could O
result N
in O
job N
losses N
in O
the O
labour N
intensive O
repair N
services N
sector N
. O

In O
practise O
it O
turns N
out H
that O
it O
is O
sometimes O
impossible O
to O
answer N
this O
question N
. O

He O
is O
not O
to O
blame O
. O

But O
on O
the O
other O
hand N
a O
good O
reputation N
will O
benefit O
him O
, O
both O
with O
respect N
to O
the O
product N
and O
to O
his O
service O
. O

The O
shopkeeper H
will O
need O
right O
of O
recourse N
which O
he O
can O
use O
to O
recover O
his O
costs N
from O
the O
manufacturer N
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
I H
do O
not O
have O
a O
script N
, O
just O
two O
observations N
. O

That O
is O
an O
utterly O
ridiculous O
assumption N
. O

But O
a O
degree N
of O
protection N
is O
not O
the O
same O
as O
absolute O
cover O
against O
a O
host N
of O
things N
at O
the O
expense N
of O
something O
similar O
. O

What O
, O
for O
instance N
, O
is O
' O
appropriate O
after-sales O
service O
' O
? O

The O
same O
applies O
to O
a O
whole O
series N
of O
other O
examples N
we H
can O
give O
. O

This O
is O
a O
sine-qua-non O
, O
and O
it O
would O
seem O
unnecessary O
to O
keep O
stressing O
it O
. O

I H
believe O
that O
this O
would O
be O
a O
lot N
easier O
if O
consumers H
were O
involved O
. O

There O
must O
be O
strict O
rules N
in O
abattoirs N
to O
maintain O
the O
highest O
levels N
of O
hygiene N
. O

Good O
farming N
practice N
and O
animal A
welfare N
can O
not O
be O
considered O
in O
isolation N
from O
food N
legislation N
as O
a O
whole O
. O

We H
have O
to O
sustain O
the O
European O
Union N
as O
a O
major O
food N
producer H
and O
a O
major O
exporter H
. O

Please O
allow O
me H
to O
say O
that O
the O
present O
report N
can O
be O
judged O
very O
positively O
. O

And O
I H
would O
not O
want O
the O
opposite O
view N
to O
arise O
through O
any O
misunderstanding N
in O
the O
present O
report N
. O

So O
we H
need O
to O
know O
the O
results N
of O
this O
debate N
and O
put O
them O
into O
effect N
. O

Commissioner H
, O
ladies H
and O
gentlemen H
, O
I H
would O
like O
to O
read O
her O
speech N
to O
you H
. O

Public O
opinion N
still O
has O
no O
faith N
in O
the O
Commission's O
Commission N
's H
ability N
to O
exercise O
control O
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
the O
European O
consumer H
needs O
to O
have O
increased O
confidence N
in O
food N
, O
not O
least O
after O
the O
BSE O
crisis N
. O

In O
Holland O
and O
other O
countries N
the O
original O
nature N
of O
national O
identity N
is O
being O
stripped O
away O
in O
the O
name N
of O
chicken N
and O
pig A
feed N
. O

Would O
that O
not O
be O
better O
than O
total O
harmonization N
, O
which O
is O
fundamentally O
a O
commercial O
rule N
aimed O
at O
promoting O
commercial O
interests N
, O
not O
food N
quality N
? O

The O
framework N
directive N
is O
part N
of O
this O
process N
. O

I H
have O
just O
another O
brief O
comment O
on O
the O
foreign O
trade N
aspect N
. O

If O
we H
are O
a O
member H
of O
an O
international O
rights N
community N
, O
then O
we H
must O
stay O
with O
it O
. O

The O
vote N
will O
be O
taken O
at O
12.00 O
noon N
tomorrow N
. O

It O
is O
complicated O
because O
it O
deals O
with O
all O
nine O
separately O
and O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
submit O
amendments N
in O
nine O
sets N
. O

Upon O
which O
safeguards N
are O
we H
insisting O
? O

With O
the O
help O
of O
their O
financial O
controller H
proper O
arrangements N
will O
now O
be O
legislated O
for O
. O

That O
is O
the O
problem N
: O
you H
can O
not O
comment O
on O
things N
that O
you H
have O
not O
read O
. O

They O
were O
set O
up O
by O
the O
European O
Union N
for O
a O
specific O
purpose N
. O

Our H
research N
has O
shown O
that O
these O
agencies N
do O
not O
need O
more O
controls N
. O

Let O
us H
hope O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
the O
proposals N
of O
the O
Commission N
will O
be O
sufficient O
to O
make O
sure O
this O
job N
will O
be O
done O
effectively O
. O

To O
a O
certain O
extent N
, O
this O
reminds O
me H
of O
my H
previous O
activity N
in O
the O
Committee N
on O
Budgets N
and O
in O
the O
Committee N
on O
Budgetary O
Control N
. O

We H
regret O
this O
and O
reaffirm O
our H
commitment N
to O
inform O
Parliament N
of O
all O
important O
agency N
decisions N
that O
have O
a O
financial O
impact N
. O

We H
take O
note N
of O
that O
, O
Mr N
von O
Habsburg H
, O
and O
I H
should O
be O
grateful O
if O
you H
could O
provide O
us H
with O
this O
letter N
. O

I H
have O
it O
here O
with O
me H
, O
Madam H
President H
. O

If O
that O
facility N
is O
available O
to O
Vice-President O
– O
and O
good O
luck N
to O
him O
– O
is O
it O
available O
to O
other O
Members H
? O

Ladies H
and O
gentlemen H
, O
you H
are O
persistently O
confusing O
the O
Minutes N
with O
the O
Report N
of O
Proceedings N
. O

I H
have O
therefore O
voted O
against O
the O
report N
. O

The O
measures N
you H
described O
could O
be O
improved O
and O
there O
are O
others O
which O
you H
did O
not O
mention O
. O

Does O
the O
Commission N
have O
any O
sort N
of O
long-term O
policy N
in O
mind N
here O
? O

The O
situation N
is O
also O
explained O
by O
the O
Asian O
and O
Russian O
crises N
, O
which O
also O
deprive O
the O
European O
Union N
of O
a O
potential O
market N
. O

Secondly O
, O
a O
promotion N
campaign N
should O
be O
swiftly O
launched O
within O
the O
Community N
to O
increase O
awareness N
amongst O
the O
general O
public O
and O
boost O
consumption N
in O
Europe O
. O

The O
taxpayer H
who O
has O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
, O
the O
smaller O
undertakings N
and O
species-friendly O
stock N
rearing O
all O
fall O
by O
the O
wayside N
. O

Nor O
have O
I H
expanded O
my H
production N
. O

What O
representation N
did O
the O
Commissioner H
receive O
from O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
Government N
about O
this O
dire O
emergency N
? O

The O
whole O
industry N
is O
in O
crisis N
. O

In O
a O
case N
like O
this O
, O
those O
governments N
that O
are O
still O
recommending O
increased O
production N
are O
being O
irresponsible O
. O

Measures N
should O
be O
the O
same O
throughout O
the O
EU O
to O
ensure O
no O
Member N
State N
gets O
an O
unfair O
advantage N
. O

Through O
you H
I H
urge O
the O
Commission N
and O
the O
Council N
to O
reach N
decisions N
and O
take O
urgent O
action N
following O
the O
meeting N
on O
14 O
October O
. O

Europe's O
Europe O
's H
farmers H
need O
help O
now O
. O

That O
just O
goes O
to O
show O
the O
possibilities N
in O
our H
country N
! O

But O
we H
do O
not O
take O
the O
view N
that O
including O
a O
corresponding O
reference N
to O
this O
in O
a O
recital N
can O
produce O
that O
result N
. O

For O
generic O
drugs N
at O
the O
end N
of O
a O
patent N
or O
other O
protection N
period N
are O
of O
course O
useful O
. O

Further O
improvements N
were O
made O
to O
the O
proposal N
in O
the O
Committee N
on O
the O
Environment N
, O
Public O
Health N
and O
Consumer H
Protection N
. O

It O
will O
be O
resumed O
at O
3 O
p.m O
. O

First O
there O
is O
the O
paragraph N
inviting O
the O
Commission N
to O
withdraw O
its O
proposal N
. O

It O
is O
very O
important O
for O
us H
to O
know O
that O
. O

Madam H
President H
, O
in O
the O
Swedish O
version N
of O
Amendment N
No-4 O
there O
is O
an O
unfortunate O
mistake N
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
very O
odd O
that O
the O
original O
text N
has O
been O
retained O
in O
this O
amendment N
. O

The O
authentic O
text N
is O
' O
under O
certain O
conditions N
' O
. O

That O
needs O
to O
be O
made O
very O
clear O
. O

But O
business N
in O
the O
audiovisual O
sector N
is O
essentially O
done O
by O
small O
and O
medium-sized O
enterprises N
. O

Katiforis O
report N
( O
A4-0090/99 O

At O
some O
stage N
in O
their O
development N
all O
SMEs O
experience N
problems N
arising O
from O
their O
weak O
capital N
resources N
. O

Finance N
and O
mentorship O
should O
go O
hand N
in O
hand N
. O

If O
demand N
were O
to O

so O
too O
would O
risk N

regardless O
of O
whether O

This O
document N
reflects O
our H
group's O
group N
's H
main O
concerns N
about O
the O
future N
of O
the O
ACP-EU O

Areas N

to O
the O

Europeans H
certainly O
ought O
to O
be O
prioritised O
for O
intensified O
action N
and O

by O
the O

demonstrated O

on O
a O
number N
of O
occasions N

Second O
Hautala O
report N
( O
A4-0029/99 O
) O

However O
, O
I H
can O
not O
support O
the O
reference N
to O
abortion N
. O

But O
the O
harmful O
psychological O
effects N
that O
abortions N
have O
on O
women H
are O
deliberately O
and O
constantly O
concealed O
. O

Entitlement N
to O
free O
abortions N
equates O
with O
women H
having O
the O
right O
to O
manage O
their O
lives N
and O
make O
decisions N
about O
their O
own O
bodies N
. O

There O
is O
no O
easy O
answer N
to O
the O
painful O
issue N
of O
abortion N
. O

I H
am O
thinking O
here O
, O
amongst O
other O
things N
, O
of O
issues N
such O
as O
the O
law N
on O
abortion N
. O

This O
objective N
requires O
a O
comprehensive O
approach N
to O
policy N
making O
and O
the O
mobilisation N
of O
all O
policy N
actors H
. O

To O
a O
certain O
extent N
, O
ensuring O
equal O
opportunities N
for O
men H
and O
women H
is O
like O
trying O
to O
attain O
the O
unattainable O
. O

I H
would O
very O
much O
like O
to O
know O
on O
what O
kind N
of O
scientific O
evidence N
the O
Greens O
are O
basing O
all O
these O
amendments N
. O

Children H
and O
workers H
at O
power N
stations N
were O
both O
studied O
. O

We H
have O
evidence N
, O
Mr N
President H
, O
but O
we H
apparently O
do O
not O
have O
proof N
. O

This O
is O
an O
issue N
which O
affects O
aspects N
of O
everyday O
life N
. O

The O
guidelines N
and O
exposure N
proposed O
by O
the O
Commissioner H
are O
based O
on O
those O
recently O
published O
by O
the O
International O
Convention N
on O
Non-Ionising O
Radiation N
Protection N
. O

Mr N
Tamino's O
Tamino O
's H
proposals N
are O
therefore O
greatly O
disproportionate O
. O

There O
are O
limited O
resources N
for O
public O
health N
and O
we H
must O
see O
to O
it O
that O
they O
are O
exploited O
effectively O
. O

The O
Commission's O
Commission N
's H
estimates N
of O
what O
would O
be O
health-endangering O
values N
reflect O
the O
outcome N
of O
the O
research N
carried O
out H
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
essential O
that O
the O
rules N
should O
be O
reasonable O
. O

Electromagnetic O
fields N
and O
their O
effect N
on O
people N
are O
subjects N
that O
have O
come O
up O
for O
debate N
with O
increasing O
frequency N
in O
recent O
years N
. O

In O
point N
of O
fact N
, O
we H
still O
do O
not O
have O
any O
precise O
answers N
to O
the O
questions N
which O
they O
raise O
. O

We H
should O
be O
establishing O
limit N
values N
on O
a O
Europe-wide O
basis N
, O
but O
they O
should O
be O
reasonable O
as O
well O
. O

Sweden O
has O
been O
mentioned O
in O
the O
discussion N
as O
one O
of O
the O
countries N
with O
satisfactory O
limit N
values N
. O

These O
are O
concentrated O
rays N
, O
but O
they O
do O
not O
penetrate O
down O
to O
where O
we H
usually O
are O
. O

For O
one O
thing N
, O
there O
is O
increasing O
concern N
, O
and O
that O
is O
undoubtedly O
true O
, O
on O
the O
part N
of O
experts H
too O
. O

Then O
there O
is O
Amendment N
No-12 O
. O

If O
necessary O
, O
the O
Commission N
will O
act O
at O
once O
. O

We H
must O
work O
to O
end N
that O
in O
a O
sensible O
way N
. O

It O
is O
also O
hard O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand N
, O
to O
expect O
countries N
to O
surrender O
sovereignty N
over O
their O
national O
health N
systems N
. O

So O
what O
should O
be O
done O
? O

The O
current O
policy N
is O
ripe O
for O
review N
and O
the O
financial O
resources N
are O
regrettably O
very O
limited O
. O

It O
is O
only O
if O
the O
disadvantages N
equal O
the O
advantages N
that O
we H
should O
use O
the O
precautionary O
principle N
. O

The O
Needle O
report N
on O
the O
European O
Union's O
Union N
's H
new O
public O
health N
policy N
seems O
to O
ignore O
this O
fact N
completely O
. O

Mr N
President H
, O
ladies H
and O
gentlemen H
, O
Mr N
Needle O
has O
gone O
to O
great O
trouble N
with O
the O
hearing O
in O
committee N
. O

I H
also O
believe O
that O
the O
regional O
authorities N
are O
not O
all O
in O
a O
position N
to O
establish O
contacts N
with O
the O
Commission N
. O

The O
report N
mentions O
best O
practice N
and O
standards N
in O
health N
care N
. O

That O
is O
in O
fact N
the O
point N
of O
departure N
we H
have O
chosen O
here O
and O
I H
am O
very O
glad O
all O
this O
has O
been O
properly O
understood O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
at O
its O
last O
vote N
on O
the O
subject N
Parliament N
approved O
these O
subsidies N
by O
a O
majority N
. O

But O
Europe O
will O
not O
stand O
by O
while O
the O
world's O
world N
's H
trade N
rules N
are O
flouted O
. O

The O
dispute N
is O
becoming O
increasingly O
bitter O
and O
is O
beginning O
to O
look O
like O
a O
trade N
war N
. O

The O
European O
Union N
put O
a O
new O
and O
revised O
banana A
regime N
in O
place N
on O
1 O
January O
1999 O
. O

For O
that O
and O
many O
other O
reasons N
we H
support O
the O
motion N
for O
a O
resolution N
. O

The O
United O
States O
has O
shown O
that O
it O
holds O
negotiations N
in O
contempt N
. O

If O
we H
do O
not O
achieve O
our H
objective N
of O
resolving O
this O
dispute N
, O
then O
I H
fear O
the O
WTO O
will O
slip O
on O
a O
banana A
skin N
. O

He O
made O
a O
resigned O
grimace N
assuming O
understanding O
... O
My H
wife H
and O
I H
decided O
we H
couldn't O
could O
n't O
stick O
it O
any O
longer O
. O

So O
we H
try O
it O
out H
here O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
; O
we'll O
we H
'll O
see O
. O

I H
read O
you H
were O
coming O
back N
, O
there O
was O
an O
article N
in O
the O
paper N
, O
my H
wife H
Margot O
sent O
it O
to O
me H
in O
Switzerland O
, O
so O
I H
thought O
it O
was O
you H
. O

You H
were O
just O
in O
front N
of O
me H
when O
we H
got O
out H
in O
Rome O
. O

Yes O
, O
I H
suppose O
I H
won't O
wo O
n't O
know O
my H
way N
around O
when O
I H
get O
into O
town N
. O

Oh O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
still O
not O
New O
York O
or O
London H
, O
don't O
do O
n't O
worry O
. O

The O
man H
spoke O
with O
an O
accent N
, O
and O
a O
certain O
European O
kind N
of O
resignation N
. O

They O
laughed O
. O

Well O
, O
in O
that O
case N
, O
we'll O
we H
'll O
probably O
bump O
into O
each O
other O
in O
Great O
Lakes N
Road N
. O

Please O
Nkrumah O
Road N
. O

I H
said O
I H
should O
have O
to O
learn O
my H
way N
round O
all O
over O
again O
. O

The O
man H
looked O
about O
quickly O
and O
lowered O
his O
voice N
. O

This O
country N
can O
do O
with O
a O
few O
more O
white O
people N
like O
you H
, O
take O
it O
from O
me H
. O

People N
with O
some O
faith N
. O

Sometimes O
I H
even O
think O
I'm O
I H
'm O
down O
South O
again O
, O
that's O
that O
's H
a O
fact N
. O

I've O
I H
've O
said O
it O
to O
my H
wife H
. O

A H
young O
black O
man H
with O
sunglasses N
and O
a O
thick O
, O
springy O
mat N
of O
hair N
shaped O
to O
a O
crew-cut O
by O
topiary N
rather O
than O
barbering O
had O
cut O
through O
the O
crowd N
with O
the O
encircling O
movement N
of O
authority N
. O

This O
way N
, O
Colonel H
, O
sir H
. O

Your H
luggage N
will O
be O
brought O
to O
the O
entrance N
, O
if O
you'll O
you H
'll O
just O
give O
me H
the O
tickets N
... O

The O
other O
man H
, O
bobbing O
in O
the O
wash N
of O
this O
activity N
yet O
smiling O
at O
it O
in O
hostly O
assumption N
of O
his O
own O
established O
residence N
in O
the O
country N
, O
was O
talking O
across O
the O
black O
man H
and O
the O
exchange N
of O
pleasantries N
, O
tickets N
, O
thanks N
: O

at O
the O
Silver N
Rhino A
, O
of O
course O
, O
you H
remember O
the O
place N
. O

Any O
time N
... O
we'd O
we H
'd O
be O
very O
pleased O
... O

He O
thanked O
him O
, O
listening O
to O
the O
two O
men H
at O
once O
and O
hearing O
neither O
, O
and O
followed O
the O
firm O
rump N
in O
white O
shorts N
past N
barriers N
and O
through O
the O
reception N
hall N
. O

That's O
That O
's H
all O
right O
, O
officer H
, O
this O
is O
Colonel H
Bray H
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
looking O
after O
Colonel H
Bray H
, O
no O
need O
to O
bother O
him O
. O

A H
youthful O
black O
official O
at O
passport N
control O
said O
uncertainly O
, O
Just O
a O
minute N
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
about O
this O
... O
but O
the O
pale O
Cockney H
who O
was O
teaching O
him O
to O
take O
over O
his O
job N
said O
, O
That's O
That O
's H
okay O
, O
chum H
, O
it's O
it O
's H
our H
ole O
friend H
Mr. N
Kabata O
. O

The O
luggage N
was O
not O
waiting O
at O
the O
flag-draped O
and O
bunting-swathed O
entrance N
, O
where O
a O
picture N
of O
a O
huge O
Roman O
emperor H
Mweta O
, O
in O
a O
toga N
, O
smiled O
as O
he O
did O
in O
the O
old O
photograph N
of O
the O
Gala N
village N
football N
team N
. O

Mr. N
Kabata O
said O
, O
What's O
What O
's H
the O
matter N
with O
these O
people N
. O
Excuse O
me H
, O
I'll O
I H
'll O
get O
a O
boy H
, O
and O
returned O
with O
the O
cases N
on O
the O
head N
of O
one O
of O
the O
stringy O
, O
splay-footed O
peasants H
who O
had O
always O
constituted O
the O
portering O
personnel N
. O

The O
porter H
addressed O
both O
men H
as O
Mukwayi O
, O
the O
respectful O
term N
became O
servile O
during O
the O
long O
time N
when O
it O
was O
used O
indiscriminately O
for O
any O
white O
man H
. O

There O
was O
an O
official O
pennant N
on O
the O
Volkswagen O
. O

Beside O
him O
, O
Kabata's O
Kabata O
's H
strong O
thighs N
filled O
the O
seat N
. O

It's O
It O
's H
not O
too O
comfortable O
for O
a O
man H
your H
height N
, O
Colonel H
. O

The O
President H
will O
be O
expecting O
me H
to O
have O
come O
for O
you H
with O
the O
Mercedes O
, O
but O
, O
honestly O
, O
if O
I'd O
I H
'd O
have O
waited O
to O
get O
it O
I H
would O
have O
turned O
up O
I H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
when O
. O

You H
know O
how O
it O
is O
just O
at O
the O
moment N
. O

Mrs. N
Indira O
Gandhi H
arrives O
this O
afternoon N
and O
yesterday N
it O
was O
United O
Nations N
and O
Sekou O
Toure O
. O

There O
were O
gilded O
arches N
over O
the O
old O
airport N
road N
to O
town N
; O
several O
men H
on O
bicycles N
wore O
shirts N
with O
Mweta's O
Mweta O
's H
face N
printed O
in O
yellow O
and O
puce O
on O
their O
backs N
. O

He O
said O
, O
All O
very O
festive O
, O
but O
it O
was O
distraction N
; O
he O
had O
the O
feeling N
of O
listening O
inwardly O
, O
watching O
for O
something O
else O
. O

The O
young O
man H
said O
, O
You H
are O
from O
Gala N
district N
. O

I H
was O
. O

Why O
, O
are O
you H
from O
there O
? O

From O
Umsalongwe O
. O

But O
my H
mother H
is O
a O
Gala N
. O

I H
have O
visited O
that O
place N
. O

Oh O
have O
you H
? O

Recently O
or O
when O
you H
were O
a O
child H
? O

Perhaps O
I H
was O
still O
there O
then O
? O

I H
think O
they'll O
they O
'll O
be O
very O
pleased O
to O
see O
you H
back N
there O
. O

He O
laughed O
. O

I H
wonder O
if O
I'll O
I H
'll O
get O
that O
far O
. O

Oh O
, O
you H
must O
make O
trip N
the O
young O
man H
said O
proudly O
. O

I H
do O
it O
to O
Umsalongwe O
in O
ten O
hours N
. O

The O
road N
is O
much O
improved O
, O
much O
improved O
. O

You'll O
You H
'll O
see O
. O

You H
could O
make O
it O
to O
Matoko O
in O
, O
say O
, O
six O
or O
seven O
. O

My H
car N
is O
a O
little O
tiny O
thing N
, O
a O
second-hand O
crock N
. O

Near O
the O
bridge N
the O
women H
were O
going O
for O
water N
with O
paraffin N
tins N
on O
their O
heads N
. O

Advertisement N
hoardings N
had O
gone O
up O
, O
there O
was O
a O
cement N
works N
, O
smart O
factories N
put O
together O
out H
of O
jutting O
glassy O
sections N
and O
, O
in O
between O
, O
the O
patches N
scratched O
in O
the O
bush A
where O
women H
and O
children H
were O
hoeing O
crooked O
rows N
of O
beans N
and O
maize A
. O

The O
children H
( O
an O
excuse N
to O
dawdle O
, O
of O
course O
) O
stopped O
and O
waved O
. O

He O
found O
himself O
waving O
back N
urgently O
, O
bending O
his O
head N
under O
the O
low O
roof N
of O
the O
car N
, O
smiling O
and O
craning O
to O
hold O
their O
faces N
when O
they O
were O
already O
out H
of O
sight N
. O

The O
car N
was O
approaching O
, O
was O
carrying O
him O
through O
the O
market N
quarter N
of O
the O
town N
. O

Under O
the O
mango A
trees A
, O
barbers H
' O
mirrors N
set O
up O
a O
flash N
in O
the O
shade N
, O
and O
live O
chickens N
lay O
in O
heaps N
with O
their O
legs N
tied O
. O

It O
was O
the O
mango A
season N
, O
and O
there O
were O
the O
saffron-yellow O
sabres N
of O
the O
pips N
, O
sucked O
hairy O
, O
everywhere O
where O
people N
passed O
. O

The O
bird A
was O
on O
the O
roof N
of O
the O
round O
, O
thatched O
guest H
room N
in O
the O
garden N
of O
his O
old O
friend H
Roland H
Dando O
– O
a O
Welshman H
– O
newly O
appointed O
as O
Attorney-General O
. O

When O
Bray H
was O
delivered O
to O
the O
house N
there O
was O
no O
one O
at O
home O
but O
servants H
well O
primed O
to O
welcome O
him O
. O

They O
gave O
him O
the O
African O
cook's O
cook H
's H
special O
lunch N
that O
he O
remembered O
so O
well O
: O
slightly O
burned O
meat N
soup N
with O
lots N
of O
barley N
, O
overdone O
steak N
with O
fried O
onions N
, O
a O
pudding N
frothy O
on O
top N
and O
gelatinous O
underneath O
, O
tasting O
of O
eggs A
and O
granadilla A
juice N
. O

Roly O
rang O
up O
to O
see O
if O
he O
had O
arrived O
, O
and O
explained O
again O
– O
he O
had O
done O
so O
in O
advance N
by O
letter N
– O
that O
he O
had O
an O
official O
lunch N
to O
attend O
. O

Bray's O
Bray H
's H
ears N
were O
filled O
with O
the O
strange O
echoes N
of O
exhaustion N
and O
, O
stoked O
up O
by O
the O
hot O
lunch N
, O
his O
body N
threatened O
to O
suffocate O
him O
with O
waves N
of O
heat N
. O

He O
went O
into O
the O
room N
kept O
darkened O
by O
drawn O
curtains N
and O
slept O
. O

There O
was O
no O
ceiling N
and O
he O
looked O
up O
into O
the O
pattern N
of O
a O
spider's O
spider A
's H
web N
made O
by O
the O
supporting O
beams N
of O
the O
roof N
. O

The O
underside N
of O
thatch N
that O
rested O
on O
it O
was O
smooth O
and O
straight O
, O
grey O
where O
it O
was O
old O
, O
blond O
where O
it O
had O
been O
replaced O
, O
and O
, O
like O
a O
tidy O
head N
, O
here O
and O
there O
showed O
a O
single O
stray O
strand N
out H
of O
place N
. O

The O
bird A
was O
probably O
balancing O
on O
the O
little O
porcelain N
conductor N
through O
which O
the O
electricity N
wire N
led O
to O
the O
light O
dangling O
above O
him O
. O

The O
bird A
was O
gone O
; O
he O
knew O
, O
almost O
as O
if O
the O
breath's O
breath N
's H
weight N
of O
claws N
had O
pressed O
down O
the O
roof N
and O
now O
the O
pressure N
was O
released O
. O

The O
sun N
had O
come O
round O
and O
the O
curtains N
glowed O
like O
the O
sky N
above O
a O
fire N
. O

Bray H
felt O
he O
must O
be O
somewhere O
about O
; O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
imagine O
this O
time N
without O
him O
. O

It O
was O
his O
as O
much O
as O
Mweta's O
Mweta O
's H
. O

But O
no O
one O
seemed O
to O
have O
seen O
him O
, O
or O
to O
know O
whether O
he O
was O
, O
or O
had O
been O
, O
in O
the O
capital N
. O

There O
were O
other O
faces N
from O
the O
past N
; O

William H
Clough O
, O
the O
Governor H
, O
lifting O
his O
bristly O
eyebrows N
in O
exaggerated O
greeting N
at O
Mweta's O
Mweta O
's H
banquet N
, O
the O
way N
he O
used O
to O
do O
on O
the O
tennis N
court N
in O
Dar-es-Salaam O
. O

James H

Joke N
, O
Vivien O
said O
. O
Produces O
a O
hearty O
, O
man-of-the-world O
laugh N
from O
Africans H
. O

The O
kind N
of O
laugh N
they've O
they O
've O
picked O
up O
from O
people N
like O
Uncle H
Willie H
said O
Neil H
. O

Still O
, O
the O
Cloughs O
pursued O
Bray H
through O
Vivien O
. O

Aunt H
Dorothy H
says O
her O
secretary's O
secretary H
's H
been O
trying O
to O
get O
hold O
of O
you H
. O

They O
want O
you H
for O

on O
Monday N
. O

I'd O
I H
'd O

, O
or O
she'll O
she O
'll O
tell O
everyone O
in O
London H

were O
buttering O
up O
to O
the O
Africans H
and O
didn't O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
see O
them O
. O

He O
laughed O
. O

No O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
true O

She O
says O
that O
about O
me H
, O
to O
my H
mother H
. O

And O
she O
knows O
quite O
well O
that O
we'd O
we H
'd O
never O
see O
each O
other O
in O
London H
either O
. O

The O
Cloughs O
had O
moved O
into O
the O
British O
Consulate N
for O
the O
last O
week N
or O
two O
before O
their O
departure N
, O
a O
large O
, O
glassy O
, O
contemporary O
house N
placed O
to O
show O
off O
the O
umbrella N
thorn-trees O
of O
the O
site N
, O
just O
as O
in O
an O
architect's O
architect H
's H
scale N
model N
. O

The O
consul H
and O
his O
wife H
had O
been O
swept O
into O
some O
back N
room N
by O
the O
presence N
of O
aides H
, O
secretaries H
, O
and O
the O
necessity N
to O
keep O
their O
cats A
out H
of O
the O
way N
of O
Lady H
Dorothy's O
Dorothy H
's H
dog A
. O

There O
was O
some O
sort N
of O
scuffle N
when O
Bray H
arrived O
... O

he O
saw O
the O
consul's O
consul H
's H
wife H
, O
whom O
he O
had O
met O
briefly O
, O
disappearing O
upstairs O
with O
her O
head N
bent O
consolingly O
to O
a O
Siamese N
. O

Flower A
arrangements N
were O
placed O
everywhere O
, O
as O
if O
there O
were O
illness N
in O
the O
house N
. O

Well O
, O
the O
job N
is O
done O
, O
one O
asks O
nothing O
more O
but O
to O
fold O
one's O
one O
's H
tents N
. O

He's O
He O
's H
a O
good O
chap H
, O
if O
they'll O
they O
'll O
let O
him O
alone O
, O
he's O
he O
's H
learnt O
a O
lot N
, O
and O
one's O
one O
's H
done O
what O
one O
could O
... O

if O
he O
keeps O
his O
head N
, O
and O
that O
one O
can't O
ca O
n't O
be O
sure O
of O
, O
not O
even O
with O
him O
, O
mmh O
? O
not O
even O
with O
him O
. O

An O
elderly O
servant H
came O
in O
with O
a O
silver N
tray N
of O
glasses N
and O
bottles N
, O
and O
Clough O
interrupted O
himself O
to O
say O
with O
the O
sweet O
forbearance N
of O
one O
who O
does O
not O
spare O
himself O
, O
encouraging O
where O
others O
would O
give O
way N
to O
exasperation N
, O
It O
would O
be O
so O
nice O
if O
we H
could O
have O
a O
few O
slices N
of O
lemon N
... O
and O
more O
ice N
? O

Yes O
, O
all O
I've O
I H
've O
said O
to O
Mweta O
, O
again O
and O
again O
... O
make O
your H
own O
pace N
. O

Make O
your H
own O
pace N
and O
stick O
to O
it O
. O

He O
knows O
his O
own O
mind N
but O
he's O
he O
's H
not O
an O
intransigent O
fellow H
at O
all O
... O

well O
, O
of O
course O
, O
you H
know O
. O

Some O
time N
ago O
... O
a O
word N
in O
your H
ear N
, O
I H
said O
, O
you'd O
you H
'd O
be O
unwise O
to O
lose O
Brigadier H
Radcliffe H
. O

Well O
, O
they've O
they O
've O
been O
clamouring O
away O
, O
of O
course O
, O
but O
he's O
he O
's H
refused O
to O
touch O
the O
army N
. O

Oh O
, O
I H
think O
I H
can O
say O
we've O
we H
've O
come O
out H
of O
it O
quite O
good O
friends H
. O

It O
was O
a O
modest O
disclaimer N
, O
with O
the O
effect N
of O
assuming O
in O
common O
the O
ease N
with O
Africans H
that O
he O
believed O
Bray H
to O
have O
. O

He O
looked O
pleasantly O
into O
the O
martini N
jug N
and O
put O
it O
down O
again O
patiently O
. O

The O
elderly O
servant H
who O
brought O
ice N
and O
lemon N
had O
the O
nicks N
at O
the O
outer O
corner N
of O
the O
eyes N
that O
Northern O
Gala N
people N
wore O
. O

That's O
That O
's H
perfect O
. O

Thank O
you H
so O
much O
. O

Bray H
greeted O
the O
servant H
in O
Gala N
with O
the O
respectful O
form N
of O
address N
for O
elders H
and O
the O
man H
dumped O
the O
impersonality O
of O
a O
servant H
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
the O
tray N
in O
his O
hands N
and O
grinned O
warmly O
, O
showing O
some O
pigmentation N
abnormality N
in O
a O
pink O
inner O
lip N
spotted O
like O
a O
Dalmatian H
. O

The O
ex-Governor O
looked O
on O
, O
smiling O
. O

The O
servant H
bowed O
confusedly O
at O
him O
, O
walking O
backwards O
, O
in O
the O
tribal O
way N
before O
rank N
, O
and O
then O
recovering O
himself O
and O
leaving O
the O
room N
with O
an O
anonymous O
lope N
. O

I'll O
I H
'll O
pour O
Dorothy's O
Dorothy H
's H
martini N
as O
well O
, O
maybe O
that'll O
that O
'll O
bring O
her O
. O

If O
only O
one O
could O
be O
transported O
on O
a O
magic N
carpet N
... O

anyway O
, O
we H
shall O
have O
three O
months N
in O
London H
now O
, O
with O
perhaps O
a O
week N
or O
two O
in O
Ireland O
. O

What've O
What O
've O
you H
been O
doing O
all O
these O
years N
in O
your H
ivory N
tower N
in O
Wiltshire O
? O

Were O
you H
a O
golfer H
, O
I H
can't O
ca O
n't O
quite O
remember O
... O
? O

Dorothy H
Clough O
came O
in O
and O
Clough O
cried O
out H
, O
Does O
it O
fit O
? O

Come O
and O
have O
a O
drink N
with O
James H
... O

My H
dear O
James H
... O
it O
must O
be O
a O
hundred O
years N
... O

We've O
We H
've O
had O
a O
crate N
made O
to O
transport O
Fritzi O
, O
and O
she's O
she O
's H
been O
trying O
it O
on O
him O
. O

My H
niece H
Vivien O
found O
a O
carpenter H
. O

She O
has O
the O
most O
extraordinary O
contacts N
, O
that O
girl H
. O

It's O
It O
's H
very O
useful O
! O

William H
Clough O
took O
a O
pecking O
sip N
at O
his O
martini N
. O
He O
said O
with O
gallant O
good O
humour N
, O
Reposting O
was O
child's O
child H
's H
play N
compared O
with O
this O
. O

One O
has O
had O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
camp O
out H
... O

I'm O
I H
'm O
sure O
it's O
it O
's H
terribly O
good O
, O
keeps O
the O
mind N
flexible O
. O

Denis H
thinks O
your H
angle N
lamp's O
lamp N
's H
been O
left O
at O
Government N
House N
, O
did O
he O
tell O
you H
? O

Dorothy H
Clough O
sat O
forward O
in O
her O
chair N
, O
as O
if O
she O
had O
alighted O
only O
for O
a O
moment N
. O

For O
heaven's O
heaven N
's H
sake N
, O
let O
them O
have O
it O
, O
it's O
it O
's H
someone O
else's O
else O
's H
turn N
to O
burn O
the O
midnight N
oil N
there O
, O
now O
... O

wha' O
d' O
you H
say O
, O
James H
... O

Roly O
Dando O
asked O
with O
grudging O
interest N
about O
the O
visit O
. O

He's O
He O
's H
never O
been O
sent O
anywhere O
where O
there O
was O
anything O
left O
to O
do O
, O
he O
said O
. O

Clough O
only O
goes O
in O
for O
the O
last O
year N
, O
after O
self-government's O
self-government N
's H
been O
granted O
and O
the O
date N
for O
independence's O
independence N
's H
been O
given O
. O

An O
early O
date N
. O

Bray H
was O
slightly O
embarrassed O
by O
gossip N
, O
when O
quite O
sober O
, O
and O
said O
hesitantly O
, O
smiling O
, O

The O
impression N
was O
that O
he O
and O
his O
wife H
were O
slipping O
away O
quietly O
after O
the O
field N
of O
battle N
. O

Since O
he O
arrived O
eighteen O
months N
ago O
there's O
there O
's H
been O
damn O
all O
for O
him O
to O
do O
except O
go O
fishing O
up O
at O
Rinsala O
. O

At O
the O
Pettigrews O
' O
house N
that O
night N
, O
Dando's O
Dando O
's H
voice N
came O
from O
the O
group N
round O
someone O
basting O
a O
sheep A
on O
the O
home-made O
spit N
: O
... O
damn O
all O
except O
go O
fishing O
with O
his O
secretary H
acting O
ghillie N
... O

Rebecca H
Edwards H
had O
just O
told O
Neil H
Bayley O
that O
Felix H
Pasilis O
, O
the O
Pettigrews O
' O
Greek O
friend H
, O
was O
furious O
with O
her O
because O
she'd O
she O
'd O
forgotten O
some O
essential O
herb N
that O
he O
wanted O
for O
his O
sheep A
... O

If O
I H
were O
Felix H
I'd O
I H
'd O
make O
you H
go O
back N
home O
and O
get O
it O
, O
my H
girl H
, O
Neil H
said O
, O
and O
the O
look O
of O
inattentive O
exhaustion N
on O
her O
rather O
heavy O
young O
face N
moved O
Bray H
in O
fellow-feeling N
to O
distract O
attention N
from O
her O
, O
saying O
, O
My H
God H
, O
I'm O
I H
'm O
afraid O
I H
behaved O
like O
a O
child H
at O
Cloughs O
' O
! O

I H
showed O
off O
by O
making O
a O
point N
of O
speaking O
to O
the O
servant H
in O
Gala N
. O

Neil H
and O
Rebecca H
Edwards H
laughed O
. O

Poor O
Uncle H
Willie H
. O

He O
was O
quite O
a O
nice O
young O
man H
in O
Dar-es-Salaam O
. O

He O
took O
Swahili N
lessons N
conscientiously O
and O
he O
certainly O
spoke O
it O
better O
than O
I H
did O
. O

To O
his O
horror N
, O
the O
elf A
burst O
into O
tears N
– O
very O
noisy O
tears N
. O

S-sit O
down O
! O
he O
wailed O
. O

Harry H
thought O
he O
heard O
the O
voices N
downstairs O
falter O
. O

Harry H
, O
trying O
to O
say O
Shh O
! O
and O
look O
comforting O
at O
the O
same O
time N
, O
ushered O
Dobby O
back N
onto O
the O
bed N
where O
he O
sat O
hiccoughing O
, O
looking O
like O
a O
large O
and O
very O
ugly O
doll N
. O

At O
last O
he O
managed O
to O
control O
himself O
, O
and O
sat O
with O
his O
great O
eyes N
fixed O
on O
Harry H
in O
an O
expression N
of O
watery O
adoration N
. O

You H
can't O
ca O
n't O
have O
met O
many O
decent O
wizards H
, O
said O
Harry H
, O
trying O
to O
cheer O
him O
up O
. O

Dobby O
shook O
his O
head N
. O

Hedwig O
had O
woken O
up O
with O
a O
particularly O
loud O
screech N
and O
was O
beating O
her O
wings N
wildly O
against O
the O
bars N
of O
her O
cage N
. O

Dobby O
almost O
spoke O
ill O
of O
his O
family N
, O
sir H
. O

Dobby O
shuddered O
. O

Oh O
no O
, O
sir H
, O
no O
Dobby O
will O
have O
to O
punish O
himself O
most O
grievously O
for O
coming O
to O
see O
you H
, O
sir H
. O

Dobby O
will O
have O
to O
shut O
his O
ears N
in O
the O
oven N
door N
for O
this O
. O

Dobby O
is O
always O
having O
to O
punish O
himself O
for O
something O
, O
sir H
. O

They O
lets O
Dobby O
get O
on O
with O
it O
, O
sir H
. O

But O
why O
don't O
do O
n't O
you H
leave O
? O

And O
the O
family N
will O
never O
set O
Dobby O
free O
. O

Harry H
stared O
. O

This O
makes O
the O
Dursleys O
sound O
almost O
human O
. O

Can't O
Ca O
n't O
anyone O
help O
you H
? O

Almost O
at O
once O
, O
Harry H
wished O
he O
hadn't O
had O
n't O
spoken O
. O

Dobby O
dissolved O
again O
into O
wails N
of O
gratitude N
. O

Dobby O
has O
heard O
of O
your H
greatness N
, O
sir H
, O
but O
of O
your H
goodness N
, O
Dobby O
never O
knew O

But O
he O
stopped O
quickly O
, O
because O
thinking O
about O
Hermione O
was O
painful O
. O

Voldemort O
? O
said O
Harry H
. O

He O
stopped O
again O
. O

Thinking O
about O
Ron H
was O
painful O
, O
too O
. O

Dobby O
leaned O
towards O
Harry H
, O
his O
eyes N
wide O
as O
headlamps N
. O

Dobby O
heard O
tell O
, O
he O
said O
hoarsely O
, O
that O
Harry H
Potter H
met O
the O
Dark O
Lord H
for O
a O
second O
time N
just O
weeks N
ago O
. O
that O
Harry H
Potter H
escaped O
yet O
again O
. O

Harry H
nodded O
and O
Dobby's O
Dobby O
's H
eyes N
suddenly O
shone O
with O
tears N
. O

He O
has O
braved O
so O
many O
dangers N
already O
! O

But O
Dobby O
has O
come O
to O
protect O
Harry H
Potter H
, O
to O
warn O
him O
, O
even O
if O
he O
does O
have O
to O
shut O
his O
ears N
in O
the O
oven N
door N
later O
. O

There O
was O
a O
silence N
broken O
only O
by O
the O
chink N
of O
knives N
and O
forks N
from O
downstairs O
and O
the O
distant O
rumble N
of O
Uncle H
Vernon's O
Vernon H
's H
voice N
. O

But O
I've O
I H
've O
got O
to O
go O
back N
– O
term N
starts O
on O
September O
the O
first O
. O

It's O
It O
's H
all O
that's O
that O
's H
keeping O
me H
going O
. O

You H
don't O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
it's O
it O
's H
like O
here O
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
belong O
here O
. O

He O
is O
too O
great O
, O
too O
good O
, O
to O
lose O
. O

" O
Why O
? O
" O
said O
Harry H
in O
surprise N
. O

Harry H
Potter H
must O
not O
put O
himself O
in O
peril N
. O

What O
terrible O
things N
? O
said O
Harry H
at O
once O
. O

Dobby O
made O
a O
funny O
choking O
noise N
and O
then O
banged O
his O
head N
madly O
against O
the O
wall N
. O

A H
sudden O
, O
unpleasant O
thought O
struck O
him O
. O

Hang O
on O
– O
this O
hasn't O
has O
n't O
got O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
Vol H
– O
sorry O
– O
with O
You H
Know O
Who O
, O
has O
it O
? O

Slowly O
, O
Dobby O
shook O
his O
head N
. O

But O
Dobby's O
Dobby O
's H
eyes N
were O
wide O
and O
he O
seemed O
to O
be O
trying O
to O
give O
Harry H
a O
hint N
. O

Harry H
, O
however O
, O
was O
completely O
at O
sea N
. O

Dobby O
shook O
his O
head N
, O
his O
eyes N
wider O
than O
ever O
. O

Dobby O
bowed O
his O
head N
. O

Albus O
Dumbledore O
is O
the O
greatest O
Headmaster H
Hogwarts O
has O
ever O
had O
. O

Dobby O
knows O
it O
, O
sir H
. O

Dobby O
has O
heard O
Dumbledore's O
Dumbledore O
's H
powers N
rival O
those O
of O
He O
Who O
Must O
Not O
Be O
Named O
at O
the O
height N
of O
his O
strength N
. O

And O
before O
Harry H
could O
stop O
him O
, O
Dobby O
bounded O
off O
the O
bed N
, O
seized O
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
desk N
lamp N
, O
and O
started O
beating O
himself O
around O
the O
head N
with O
ear-splitting O
yelps N
. O

A H
sudden O
silence N
fell O
downstairs O
. O

What O
– O
the O
– O
devil N
– O
are O
– O
you H
– O
doing O
? O
said O
Uncle H
Vernon H
through O
gritted O
teeth N
, O
his O
face N
horribly O
close O
to O
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
. O

He O
stomped O
flat-footed O
from O
the O
room N
. O

Shaking O
, O
Harry H
let O
Dobby O
out H
of O
the O
wardrobe N
. O

Friends H
who O
don't O
do O
n't O
even O
write O
to O
Harry H
Potter H
? O
said O
Dobby O
slyly O
. O

Dobby O
shuffled O
his O
feet N
. O

Dobby O
has O
them O
here O
, O
sir H
, O
said O
the O
elf A
. O

Stepping O
nimbly O
out H
of O
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
reach N
, O
he O
pulled O
a O
thick O
wad N
of O
envelopes N
from O
the O
inside O
of O
the O
pillowcase N
he O
was O
wearing O
. O

Harry H
could O
make O
out H
Hermione's O
Hermione O
's H
neat O
writing N
, O
Ron's O
Ron H
's H
untidy O
scrawl N
and O
even O
a O
scribble N
that O
looked O
as O
though O
it O
was O
from O
the O
Hogwarts O
gamekeeper H
, O
Hagrid O
. O

The O
moment N
she O
saw O
Harry H
, O
Ginny O
accidentally O
knocked O
her O
porridge N
bowl N
to O
the O
floor N
with O
a O
loud O
clatter N
. O

Ginny O
seemed O
very O
prone O
to O
knocking O
things N
over O
whenever O
Harry H
entered O
a O
room N
. O

She O
dived O
under O
the O
table N
to O
retrieve O
the O
bowl N
and O
emerged O
with O
her O
face N
glowing O
like O
the O
setting O
sun N
. O

Pretending O
he O
hadn't O
had O
n't O
noticed O
this O
, O
Harry H
sat O
down O
and O
took O
the O
toast N
Mrs N
Weasley O
offered O
him O
. O

For O
a O
few O
minutes N
there O
was O
silence N
as O
they O
all O
read O
their O
letters N
. O

Harry's O
Harry H
's H
told O
him O
to O
catch O
the O
Hogwarts O
Express N
as O
usual O
from O
King's O
King O
's H
Cross O
station N
on O
September O
the O
first O
. O

There O
was O
also O
a O
list N
of O
the O
new O
books N
he'd O
he O
'd O
need O
for O
the O
coming O

Fred H
, O
who O
had O
finished O
his O
own O
list N
, O
peered O
over O
at O
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
. O

The O
new O
Defense N
Against O
the O
Dark O
Arts N
teacher H
must O
be O
a O
fan H
– O
bet O
it's O
it O
's H
a O
witch H
. O

At O
this O
point N
, O
Fred H
caught O
his O
mother's O
mother H
's H
eye N
and O
quickly O
busied O
himself O
with O
the O
marmalade N
. O

Oh O
, O
are O
you H
starting O
at O
Hogwarts O
this O
year N
? O
Harry H
asked O
Ginny O
. O

She O
nodded O
, O
blushing O
to O
the O
roots N
of O
her O
flaming O
hair N
, O
and O
put O
her O
elbow N
in O
the O
butter N
dish N
. O

Fortunately O
no O
one O
saw O
this O
except O
Harry H
, O
because O
just O
then O
Ron's O
Ron H
's H
elder O
brother H
Percy H
walked O
in O
. O

He O
was O
already O
dressed O
, O
his O
Hogwarts O
prefect H
badge N
pinned O
to O
his O
knitted O
tank N
top N
. O

He O
sat O
down O
in O
the O
only O
remaining O
chair N
but O
leapt O
up O
again O
almost O
immediately O
, O
pulling O
from O
underneath O
him O
a O
moulting O
, O
grey O
feather N
duster N
– O
at O
least O
, O
that O
was O
what O
Harry H
thought O
it O
was O
, O
until O
he O
saw O
that O
it O
was O
breathing O
. O

I H
wrote O
to O
her O
saying O
we H
were O
going O
to O
try O
and O
rescue O
you H
from O
the O
Dursleys O
. O

Then O
he O
ripped O
open O
Hermione's O
Hermione O
's H
letter N
and O
read O
it O
out H
loud O
: O

Dear O
Ron H
, O
and O
Harry H
if O
you're O
you H
're O
there O
, O

I H
hope O
everything O
went O
all O
right O
and O
that O
Harry H
is O
okay O
and O
that O
you H
didn't O
did O
n't O
do O
anything O
illegal O
to O
get O
him O
out H
, O
Ron H
, O
because O
that O
would O
get O
Harry H
into O
trouble N
, O
too O
. O

I've O
I H
've O
been O
really O
worried O
and O
if O
Harry H
is O
all O
right O
, O
will O
you H
please O
let O
me H
know O
at O
once O
, O
but O
perhaps O
it O
would O
be O
better O
if O
you H
used O
a O
different O
owl A
, O
because O
I H
think O
another O
delivery N
might O
finish O
your H
one O
off O
. O

I'm O
I H
'm O
very O
busy O
with O
schoolwork N
, O
of O
course O
– O

– O
and O
we're O
we H
're O
going O
to O
London H
next O
Wednesday O
to O
buy O
my H
new O
books N
. O

Why O
don't O
do O
n't O
we H
meet O
in O
Diagon O
Alley O
? O

Let O
me H
know O
what's O
what O
's H
happening O
as O
soon O
as O
you H
can O
, O
love N
from O
Hermione O
. O

Harry H
, O
Ron H
, O
Fred H
and O
George H
were O
planning O
to O
go O
up O
the O
hill N
to O
a O
small O
paddock N
the O
Weasleys O
owned O
. O

It O
was O
surrounded O
by O
trees A
that O
blocked O
it O
from O
view N
of O
the O
village N
below O
, O
meaning O
that O
they O
could O
practise O
Quidditch O
there O
, O
as O
long O
as O
they O
didn't O
did O
n't O
fly O
too O
high O
. O

They O
couldn't O
could O
n't O
use O
real O
Quidditch O
balls N
, O
which O
would O
have O
been O
hard O
to O
explain O
if O
they O
had O
escaped O
and O
flown O
away O
over O
the O
village N
; O
instead O
they O
threw O
apples N
for O
each O
other O
to O
catch O
. O

They O
took O
turns N
to O
ride O
Harry's O
Harry H
's H
Nimbus O
Two O
Thousand O
, O
which O
was O
easily O
the O
best O
broom N
; O
Ron's O
Ron H
's H
old O
Shooting O
Star N
was O
often O
outstripped O
by O
passing O
butterflies A
. O

Five O
minutes N
later O
they O
were O
marching O
up O
the O
hill N
, O
broomsticks N
over O
their O
shoulders N
. O

They O
had O
asked O
Percy H
if O
he O
wanted O
to O
join O
them O
, O
but O
he O
had O
said O
he O
was O
busy O
. O

Harry H
had O
only O
seen O
Percy H
at O
meal-times O
so O
far O
; O
he O
stayed O
shut O
in O
his O
room N
the O
rest N
of O
the O
time N
. O

Wish O
I H
knew O
what O
he O
was O
up O
to O
, O
said O
Fred H
, O
frowning O
. O

If O
we're O
we H
're O
not O
careful O
, O
we'll O
we H
'll O
have O
another O
Head A
Boy H
in O
the O
family N
. O

I H
don't O
do O
n't O
think O
I H
could O
stand O
the O
shame N
. O

Bill H
was O
the O
oldest O
Weasley O
brother H
. O

He O
and O
the O
next O
brother H
, O
Charlie H
, O
had O
already O
left O
Hogwarts O
. O

Harry H
had O
never O
met O
either O
of O
them O
, O
but O
knew O
that O
Charlie H
was O
in O
Romania O
, O
studying O
dragons A
, O
and O
Bill H
in O
Egypt O
, O
working O
for O
the O
wizard's O
wizard H
's H
bank N
, O
Gringotts O
. O

Harry H
said O
nothing O
. O

He O
felt O
a O
bit N
awkward O
. O

Stored O
in O
an O
underground N
vault N
at O
Gringotts O
in O
London H
was O
a O
small O
fortune N
that O
his O
parents H
had O
left O
him O
. O

of O
course O
, O
it O
was O
only O
in O
the O
wizarding O
world N
that O
he O
had O
money N
; O
you H
couldn't O
could O
n't O
use O
Galleons N
, O
Sickles N
, O
and O
Knuts H
in O
Muggle O
shops N
. O

He O
had O
never O
mentioned O
his O
Gringotts O
bank N
account N
to O
the O
Dursleys O
; O
he O
didn't O
did O
n't O
think O
their O
horror N
of O
anything O
connected O
with O
magic N
would O
stretch O
to O
a O
large O
pile N
of O
gold N
. O

Mrs N
Weasley O
woke O
them O
all O
early O
the O
following O
Wednesday O
. O

After O
a O
quick O
half-a-dozen O
bacon N
sandwiches N
each O
, O
they O
pulled O
on O
their O
coats N
and O
Mrs N
Weasley O
took O
a O
flowerpot N
off O
the O
kitchen N
mantelpiece N
and O
peered O
inside O
. O

We'll O
We H
'll O
have O
to O
buy O
some O
more O
today N
ah O
well O
, O
guests H
first O
! O

And O
she O
offered O
him O
the O
flowerpot N
. O

Harry H
stared O
at O
them O
all O
watching O
him O
. O

Never O
? O
said O
Mr N
Weasley O
. O

How O
exactly O
– O

He O
took O
a O
pinch N
of O
glittering O
powder N
out H
of O
the O
flowerpot N
, O
stepped O
up O
to O
the O
fire N
, O
and O
threw O
the O
powder N
into O
the O
flames N
. O

With O
a O
roar N
, O
the O
fire N
turned O
emerald N
green O
and O
rose O
higher O
than O
Fred H
, O
who O
stepped O
right O
into O
it O
, O
shouted O
, O
Diagon O
Alley O
! O
and O
vanished O
. O

We H
lived O
in O
a O
big O
light O
spacious O
well-windowed O
generous O
house N
, O
designed O
by O
Lutyens O
. O

My H
father H
had O
bought O
it O
for O
my H
mother H
in O
a O
grand O
gesture N
of O
love N
and O
pride N
. O

Not O
for O
her O
a O
poky O
terrace N
with O
a O
dog A
kennel N
and O
an O
outside O
toilet N
. O

The O
garden N
shrubbed O
and O
green O
had O
a O
noose N
of O
trees A
all O
round O
it O
and O
in O
the O
centre N
of O
the O
rolled O
lawn N
was O
a O
Victorian O
sun-dial O
of O
granite N
and O
slate N
. O

At O
the O
bottom N
of O
the O
dial N
was O
the O
hooded O
figure N
of O
Time N
scything O
the O
hours N
, O
but O
at O
the O
top N
, O
over O
the O
position N
of O
the O
twelve N
was O
an O
angel A
with O
a O
trumpet N
bearing O
the O
inscription N
' O
Aliquem O
alium O
internum O
' O
. O

I H
did O
not O
know O
what O
this O
meant O
and O
when O
I H
was O
able O
to O
translate O
it O
I H
did O
not O
understand O
it O
. O

Later O
it O
came O
to O
mean O
a O
great O
deal N
to O
me H
but O
that O
is O
not O
yet O
. O

His O
own O
family N
were O
Liverpool O
limeys H
; O
had O
always O
worked O
the O
docks N
, O
the O
boats N
, O
in O
the O
Navy N
or O
as O
Merchant H
seamen H
. O

The O
women H
had O
worked O
in O
the O
clutter N
of O
cargo N
offices N
up O
and O
down O
the O
quays N
. O

His O
mother H
, O
my H
grandmother H
, O
had O
been O
the O
Official O
Polisher N
of O
Brass N
Plaques N
and O
some O
said O
that O
when O
she O
had O
finished O
her O
Friday N
round O
the O
shine N
of O
it O
was O
so O
bright O
that O
it O
tipped O
the O
waves N
like O
a O
skimming O
stone N
and O
could O
still O
be O
seen O
in O
the O
harbour N
of O
New O
York O
. O

' O
The O
other O
way N
round O
. O
' O

He O
had O
been O
made O
a O
Director H
of O
the O
Line N
. O

Yes O
. O
No O
. O
The O
clock N
ticking O
and O
the O
smell N
of O
buttered O
kippers N
. O

The O
young O
man H
out H
of O
his O
mother's O
mother H
's H
body N
and O
wearing O
his O
father's O
father H
's H
clothes N
. O

Be O
someone O
. O
Be O
someone O
. O

Redeem O
history N
. O

Make O
our H
lives N
not O
an O
endless O
sacrifice N
but O
a O
gathering N
of O
energy N
, O
the O
strength N
to O
jump O
, O
but O
we H
fall O
, O
until O
you H
who O
leap O
and O
do O
not O
fall O
. O

Then O
we H
see O
what O
we H
were O
for O
, O
the O
single O
stuttered O
words N
gain O
the O
momentum N
of O
narrative N
. O

This O
is O
the O
story N
of O
a O
humble O
family N
who O
became O
a O
name N
. O

My H
son H
David H
whose O
father H
grandfather H
and O
great-grandfather O
unto O
the O
sixth O
generation A
worked O
the O
docks N
. O

My H
son H
David H
, O
rich O
, O
respected O
, O
powerful O
, O
a O
man H
. O

My H
son H
David H
whose O
eyes N
have O
the O
shine N
of O
them O
. O

My H
son H
David H
pulling O
history N
home O
. O

When O
she O
was O
eleven O
, O
Papa H
died O
. O

Within O
three O
months N
Mother H
in O
a O
little O
black O
suit N
, O
child H
in O
black O
warm O
coat N
, O
took O
ship N
to O
Hamburg O
and O
re-settled O
in O
Berlin O
. O

The O
books N
and O
the O
bookshop N
had O
been O
sold O
and O
the O
secret O
room N
was O
empty O
. O

My H
grandmother H
was O
singing O
a O
hymn N
, O
essentially O
praising O
God H
but O
effectively O
preventing O
my H
father H
from O
hearing O
what O
was O
happening O
. O

It O
was O
a O
quick O
birth N
and O
when O
I H
was O
laid O
on O
my H
mother's O
mother H
's H
breast N
, O
my H
grandmother H
ate O
a O
sandwich N
and O
went O
to O
tell O
my H
father H
that O
he O
had O
the O
pleasure N
of O
a O
daughter H
. O

It O
was O
what O
Jove O
had O
said O
a O
few O
months N
ago O
when O
he O
had O
been O
holding O
my H
wrist N
, O
too O
tightly O
, O
across O
a O
restaurant N
table N
. O

She O
was O
still O
holding O
my H
hand N
and O
what O
I H
did O
was O
outside O
of O
anything O
I H
had O
imagined O
I H
would O
do O
. O

I H
leaned O
across O
the O
narrow O
table N
and O
kissed O
her O
. O

My H
head N
was O
engaged O
and O
I H
was O
pushing O
out H
of O
my H
mother's O
mother H
's H
chthonic O
underworld N
into O
my H
father's O
father H
's H
world N
of O
difficulty N
and O
dream N
. O

I H
never O
expected O
to O
go O
back N
down O
again O
. O

When O
she O
ate O
her O
scones N
she O
left O
a O
snail-trail O
of O
soot N
along O
her O
upper O
lip N
. O

Her O
neighbour H
called O
her O
' O
Blackmouth O
' O
. O

My H
grandmother H
called O
her O
neighbour H
' O
Stinkpad O
' O
but O
otherwise O
they O
were O
friendly O
, O
exchanging O
handkerchiefs N
and O
soap N
at O
Christmas O
. O

Cowardice N
bedshares O
with O
arrogance N
. O

I H
was O
afraid O
and O
I H
wanted O
to O
bluff O
my H
way N
out H
. O

The O
kiss O
was O
a O
smoke N
bomb N
to O
cause O
confusion N
and O
distract O
attention N
. O

I H
thought O
she O
might O
slap N
me H
. O

I H
thought O
she O
would O
rush O
away O
. O

In O
fact N
she O
did O
nothing O
. O

Asked O
her O
question N
and O
did O
nothing O
. O

I H
started O
to O
re-eat O
my H
cold O
pasta N
. O

I H
would O
have O
been O
glad O
to O
climb O
into O
the O
plate N
and O
cover O
myself H
in O
clam A
sauce N
. O

I H
was O
at O
the O
age N
of O
making O
lists N
but O
the O
lists N
I H
made O
were O
correspondences N
, O
half O
true O
and O
altogether O
fanciful O
, O
of O
the O
earth N
the O
sea N
and O
the O
sky N
. O

Perhaps O
I H
was O
trying O
to O
hold O
together O
my H
own O
world N
that O
was O
in O
so O
much O
danger N
of O
falling O
away O
. O

Perhaps O
I H
wanted O
order N
where O
there O
was O
none O
. O

As O
the O
QE2 O
floated O
so O
confidently O
on O
the O
waters N
I H
thought O
of O
the O
Titanic O
, O
ghostly O
and O
abandoned O
beneath O
, O
and O
somewhere O
above O
, O
in O
the O
secretive O
blackness N
, O
the O
Ship N
of O
Fools H
navigating O
the O
stars N
. O

Was O
it O
the O
comet N
? O

Accordingly O
, O
my H
father H
put O
on O
his O
Jolly O
Jack H
Tars N
and O
my H
mother H
wrapped O
herself O
up O
in O
her O
mink N
coat N
. O

In O
those O
days N
their O
car N
was O
a O
three-litre O
Rover O
, O
really O
, O
a O
leather N
three-piece O
suite N
and O
cocktail N
cabinet N
on O
wheels N
. O

My H
father H
purred O
down O
to O
the O
docks N
looking O
like O
a O
criminal O
, O
while O
my H
mother H
fixed O
herself O
a O
strictly O
forbidden O
gin N
and O
tonic N
in O
the O
back N
. O

When O
Stella H
kissed O
me H
I H
remember O
thinking O
, O
' O
This O
is O
not O
allowed O
. O
' O

I H
was O
glad O
of O
the O
fog N
and O
the O
dark O
because O
I H
knew O
that O
if O
anyone O
saw O
us H
, O
the O
totality N
of O
our H
lives N
; O
history N
, O
complexity N
, O
nationality N
, O
intelligence N
, O
age N
, O
achievement N
, O
status N
, O
would O
be O
shrunk O
up O
to O
the O
assumptions N
of O
our H
kiss O
. O

Whoever O
saw O
us H
would O
say O
, O
' O
There's O
There O
's H
a O
couple N
of O
... O
' O
, O
and O
this O
kiss O
, O
tentative O
, O
ambivalent O
, O
would O
become O
a O
lock N
and O
key N
. O

' O
David H
, O
' O
she O
said O
. O

She O
was O
wearing O
a O
black O
oilskin N
that O
had O
been O
her O
husband's O
husband H
's H
. O

It O
hung O
on O
her O
from O
head N
to O
foot N
, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
she O
seemed O
less O
to O
be O
wearing O
a O
rainproof O
than O
to O
be O
in O
the O
grip N
of O
a O
monster H
from O
the O
Deep N
. O

She O
and O
I H
would O
be O
approaching O
the O
place N
from O
opposite O
ends N
of O
town N
. O

I H
imagined O
her O
, O
angry O
, O
confident O
, O
ready O
to O
match O
me H
and O
beat O
me H
at O
my H
own O
game N
. O

This O
was O
the O
big O
fight N
and O
Jove O
the O
prize N
. O

When O
I H
told O
him O
she O
had O
written O
to O
me H
he O
had O
decided O
to O
visit O
friends H
for O
the O
weekend N
. O

At O
the O
same O
time N
I H
realised O
that O
I H
would O
like O
to O
do O
much O
more O
kissing N
if O
it O
were O
not O
so O
complicated O
. O

So O
complicated O
. O

My H
first O
serious O
emotion N
was O
for O
a O
married O
man H
. O

My H
first O
experience N
of O
authentic O
desire N
was O
with O
a O
married O
woman H
. O

You H
see O
, O
I H
did O
want O
to O
kiss O
her O
. O

That O
was O
what O
surprised O
me H
most O
of O
all O
. O

As O
he O
gossiped O
and O
lounged O
the O
noise N
of O
the O
Remington O
stopped O
. O

His O
secretary H
came O
out H
from O
the O
low O
line N
of O
offices N
that O
huddled O
to O
the O
waterfront N
. O

There O
was O
an O
urgent O
call N
for O
him O
. O

Would O
he O
step O
inside O
at O
once O
? O

My H
father H
loved O
the O
sea N
and O
should O
have O
been O
an O
active O
seaman H
but O
there O
were O
more O
opportunities N
indoors O
for O
a O
bright O
boy H
who O
had O
a O
way N
about O
him O
. O

He O
compensated O
by O
wheedling O
his O
way N
onto O
the O
tugs N
, O
and O
because O
there O
was O
still O
an O
apprenticeship N
mentality N
about O
the O
Company N
, O
his O
oddity N
was O
tolerated O
. O

What O
harm N
could O
it O
do O
and O
wasn't O
was O
n't O
all O
experience N
useful O
? O

Besides O
, O
he O
did O
it O
in O
his O
own O
time N
and O
it O
made O
him O
popular O
with O
the O
men H
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
in O
a O
maze N
of O
soggy O
sheets N
and O
copies N
of O
Woman's O
Woman O
's H
Weekly N
, O
my H
father H
speared O
my H
mother H
on O
his O
manhood N
. O

It O
was O
a O
shining O
morning N
, O
he O
was O
leaning O
on O
the O
harbourside O
rail N
, O
watching O
the O
cranes N
load O
the O
ships N
. O

The O
world N
poured O
through O
his O
fingers N
; O
spices N
, O
wine N
, O
tea N
, O
green O
bananas A
, O
coconuts N
, O
American O
golf N
clubs N
, O
blankets N
made O
of O
wool N
with O
satin N
hemmed O
round O
the O
edges N
. O

Today O
they O
were O
loading O
nylon N
stockings N
, O
Monroe O
look-alikes H
stamped O
all O
over O
the O
cardboard N
boxes N
. O

' O
I H
came O
here O
to O
meet O
... O
' O

He O
had O
risen O
in O
the O
world N
and O
now O
he O
was O
going O
to O
prove O
it O
. O

On O
board N
my H
grandmother H
unpacked O
her O
carpet N
bag N
. O

She O
set O
out H
a O
pile N
of O
clean O
rags N
, O
the O
ones O
she O
used O
for O
polishing O
the O
brass N
plaques N
, O
a O
bottle N
of O
cooking O
brandy N
, O
a O
bottle N
of O
iodine N
, O
a O
primus O
stove N
, O
a O
cylinder N
of O
water N
, O
a O
kitchen N
knife N
, O
a O
packet N
of O
sandwiches N
, O
a O
little O
blanket N
from O
the O
dog's O
dog A
's H
box N
, O
her O
spectacles N
and O
the O
Bible N
, O
now O
open O
towards O
the O
end N
of O
the O
Psalms N
. O

This O
done O
, O
she O
took O
off O
her O
oilskin N
and O
pegged O
it O
over O
the O
hatch N
. O

I H
had O
her O
letter N
in O
my H
pocket N
. O

The O
careful O
handwriting N
. O

The O
instruction N
to O
obey O
. O

' O
I H
will O
meet O
you H
on O
Wednesday O
the O
12th O
at O
6:30 O
p.m. O
in O
the O
bar N
at O
the O
Algonquin O
Hotel O
. O
' O

He O
knew O
the O
gangmen O
and O
the O
loaders H
and O
the O
truck N
drivers H
and O
the O
harbour N
pilots H
, O
and O
as O
he O
leaned O
on O
his O
rail N
, O
watching O
, O
sometimes O
waving O
, O
other O
men H
joined O
him O
, O
lit O
a O
cigarette N
, O
told O
him O
the O
news N
and O
with O
a O
slap N
on O
the O
back N
, O
moved O
on O
. O

The O
easy O
fraternity N
of O
working O
men H
was O
comfortable O
to O
him O
. O

No O
one O
here O
asked O
him O
what O
school N
he O
had O
attended O
. O

' O
Is O
something O
wrong O
? O
' O
said O
my H
father H
. O

My H
father H
used O
to O
tell O
me H
I H
had O
an O
octopus-complex O
. O

' O
Must O
you H
try O
and O
do O
eight O
things N
at O
once O
? O
' O

I H
used O
to O
imagine O
that O
there O
was O
an O
octopus N
, O
hooded O
, O
ancient O
, O
floating O
in O
the O
limp O
waters N
of O
my H
body N
, O
reaching O
out H
, O
dark O
and O
blind O
, O
using O
the O
tentacles N
to O
probe O
what O
stood O
outside O
it O
. O

Analogies N
fail O
, O
but O
I H
am O
capable O
of O
behaving O
like O
an O
eight-armed O
cephalopod A
while O
protesting O
the O
innocence N
of O
my H
two O
hands N
on O
the O
table N
. O

His O
father H
, O
my H
grandfather H
, O
was O
killed O
in O
a O
war N
farce N
when O
an O
American O
torpedo H
scuppered O
the O
wrong O
boat N
. O

As O
a O
result N
, O
my H
grandmother H
was O
paid O
a O
sizeable O
pension N
and O
was O
able O
to O
have O
her O
wild O
strong O
son H
privately O
educated O
. O

She O
poured O
her O
money N
into O
him O
as O
though O
he O
were O
a O
treasure N
chest N
. O

He O
learned O
well O
, O
looked O
well O
, O
and O
if O
anyone O
questioned O
him O
about O
his O
Mersey O
terrace N
two O
up O
two O
down O
he O
simply O
knocked O
them O
out H
. O

Throughout O
his O
life N
my H
father H
has O
dealt O
with O
difficult O
questions N
by O
knocking O
them O
out H
. O

What O
is O
unconscious O
does O
not O
speak O
and O
that O
included O
the O
hidden O
part N
of O
himself O
. O

She O
had O
been O
well O
educated O
and O
taught O
to O
conceal O
it O
. O

She O
never O
gave O
up O
singing O
and O
playing O
the O
piano N
and O
she O
never O
gave O
up O
her O
watercolours N
. O

The O
rest N
of O
the O
mind N
she O
disposed O
of O
at O
marriage N
and O
did O
not O
think O
to O
ask O
my H
father H
what O
he O
had O
done O
with O
it O
. O

Why O
had O
she O
chosen O
here O
? O

Here O
it O
was O
. O

Five O
minutes N
to O
spare O
. O

The O
cruelty N
of O
time N
. O

Did O
I H
say O
that O
? O

No O
she O
did O
. O

I H
sometimes O
think O
my H
personality N
is O
a O
troopship's O
troopship N
's H
atoll N
; O
invade O
me H
. O

And O
so O
the O
three O
of O
them O
climbed O
aboard O
the O
Godspeed O
and O
chugged O
into O
the O
dark O
. O

When O
I H
was O
born O
the O
waters N
were O
still O
alive O
. O

My H
father H
too O
, O
was O
still O
alive O
, O
strong O
and O
burly O
, O
as O
wide O
as O
he O
was O
tall O
, O
with O
an O
enormous O
chest N
that O
looked O
as O
though O
it O
could O
tow O
the O
cargo N
boats N
itself H
. O

We H
cooked O
breakfast N
in O
the O
remains O
of O
the O
frying O
pan N
and O
ate O
our H
food N
standing O
up O
, O
looking O
out H
of O
the O
window N
over O
to O
the O
park N
. O
